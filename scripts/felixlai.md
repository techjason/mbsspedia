# General Surgical Diseases

## Suture material

I. Overview

1. Suture size
   ➡ Size refers to the diameter of suture strand
   ➡ The more "0", the small the strand diameter
   - 2-0 or 00 is larger than (粗過) 4-0 or 0000
   - “細number 粗D”

2. Characteristics of an ideal sutures
   ➡ Minimal tissue reaction
   ➡ Smoothness (minimum tissue drag)
   ➡ Low capillarity (ability to fluid to travel along sutures)
   ➡ Maximum tensile strength
   ➡ Ease of handling (minimum memory)
   ➡ Knot security
   ➡ Consistency of performance
   ➡ Predictable performance
   ➡ Cost-effectiveness

[Image Description: This page shows the general surgical diseases and the suture material used. The page includes topics such as overview, suture size, and the characteristics of the ideal suture.]

II. Classification of sutures

1. General features
   ➡ Overview of classification

- Monofilament VS Multifilament (braided)
- Absorbable VS Non-absorbable
- Natural VS Synthetic

2. Monofilament VS Multifilament (braided)
   ➡ Monofilament

- V: Smooth tissue passage/ Less infection risk/ Higher tensile strength/ No capillary action
- X: More knots required/ More easily damaged or nicked/ Has memory
  ➡ Multifilament
- V: Better knot security/ Better handling
- X: Less smooth passage/ Higher infection risk (harbour bacteria between strands)/ Less
  tensile strength/ Has capillary action - Can be coated for smoother passage - Can be impregnated with antibiotics to decrease infection risk

3. Absorbable VS Non-absorbable
   ➡ Absorbable

- Defined as loss of tensile strength rather than absorption of mass which takes longer time
- Loss of ≥ 50% tensile strength within 4 weeks by proteolytic or hydrolytic process which
  is eventually absorbed within living tissues
- **NO** removal of sutures is required
  ➡ Non-absorbable
- Defined as maintaining tensile strength in tissues for at least a period of time (60 days)
  - Silk, linen, nylon will lose tensile strength over a period of time
  - Polyester, polyethylene, polybutester, polypropylene and steel are truly non-absorbable
- Only used when long-term support is required
- Removed when used in skin
- Tissue reactions are generally low except for silk

4. Natural VS Synthetic
   ➡ Natural

- Absorption via enzyme-mediated proteolytic process which leads to more inflammation
  and scarring
  ➡ Synthetic
- Absorption via hydrolytic process which has less inflammation

➡ General principles of choice

- Ligation of artery = Multifilament non-absorbable sutures required (e.g. Mersilk)
- Anastomosis = Monofilament absorbable sutures required (e.g. PDS II)
  ➡ Features of different sutures
- PDS II = Monofilament absorbable synthetic suture
  - Most commonly used to approximate soft tissues
- Vicryl = Multifilament absorbable synthetic suture
  - Coated Vicryl = Help tissue passage, increase accuracy of knot placement, decrease incarceration
  - Coated Vicryl Rapide = Coated Vicryl ionized with Gamma rays, fastest-absorbing synthetic sutures
  - Coated Vicryl Plus = Coated with antimicrobials
- Ethilon = Monofilament non-absorbable synthetic suture
  - Good memory and minimal tissue reaction
  - Poor knot security
    - Prolene has the best knot security among most monofilaments
  - Good for skin closure in adults after abdominal surgery
- Mersilk = Multifilament non-absorbable natural suture
  - Behaves like a very slow absorbable suture although it is classified as non-absorbable
  - Lost all tensile strength within 1 year and nearly undetectable after 2 years
  - Strong tissue reactions and high capillary action encouraging infection

# Nutrition and assessment

I. **Metabolic response to injury**

1. Phases of physiological response
   ➡ Metabolic response to injury in humans is divide into EBB and FLOW phase - Ebb phase = 24 – 48 HOURS - (Catabolic) Flow phase = 3 – 10 DAYS - (Anabolic) Flow phase = WEEKS

2. Ebb phase
   ➡ Overview - Conserve both circulating volume and energy stores for recovery and repairs - Can be attenuated by proper resuscitation but not completely abolished
   ➡ Regulation of ebb phase - **Hormones**: Catecholamines/ Cortisol/ Aldosterone (following RAAS activation)
   ➡ Clinical manifestation - ↓Basal metabolic rate (BMR) - ↓ O2 consumption - ↓ Cardiac output (CO) - ↓ Body temperature (Hypothermia) - Hypovolemia - Lactic acidosis

3. (Catabolic) Flow phase
   ➡ Overview - Hypermetabolic flow phase which occurs following resuscitation in ebb phase - **NOT** all tissues undergo catabolism and the essence of this coordinated response is to allow body to reprioritized limited resources away from peripheral tissues (e.g. skin/ adipose tissues/ muscle) to vital viscera and the wound - Involves mobilization of body energy stores for recovery and repair and the subsequent replacement of lost or damaged tissues
   ➡ Regulation of flow phase - **Hormones**: Catecholamines/ Cortisol/ Insulin/ Glucagon - **Cytokines**: TNF-α/ IL-1/ IL-6
   ➡ Clinical manifestation - ↑ Basal metabolic rate (BMR) - ↑ O2 consumption - ↑ Cardiac output (CO) - ↑ Body temperature (Hyperthermia) - Leukocytosis - Vasodilation and increased vascular permeability - Leads to tissue edema - Increased gluconeogenesis - Increased insulin production and insulin resistance - Patient therefore exhibit poor glycemic control - Fat and protein catabolism - Leads to muscle wasting and significant weight loss

16

4. (Anabolic) Flow phase
   ➡ Overview

- Recovery phase
- Restoration of lean body mass, body weight, fat and protein storage

II. Nutritional status

1. Daily requirement of fluid and nutrient
   ➡ Fluid requirement = 30-40 mL/kg
   ➡ Energy requirement = 20-30 kcal/kg/day

- Carbohydrate requirement = 100 - 200 g/day
- Essential fatty acid requirement = 100-200 g/week
- Protein requirement = 1.2 g/kg/day

2. Assessment of nutritional status
   ➡ History taking

- Oral intake and food intolerance
- Weight loss > 10% in 6 months
  ➡ Physical examination
- Body mass index (BMI)
- Wasting of temporalis, masseter and small hands muscles
- Measurement of static calorie reserve
- Triceps skinfold
- Subscapular skinfold
- Measurement of static protein reserve
- Mid-arm circumference
  ➡ Biochemical tests
- Serum albumin level
- Half-life (t1/2) = 18-20 days (**longest**)
- **MOST** extensively used parameter
- Serum pre-albumin level
- Half-life (t1/2) = 2-3 days (**shortest**)
- Responds quickly to the onset of malnutrition and rises rapidly with adequate protein intake
- Level is altered in acute phase response due to acute or chronic inflammation as well as in liver or renal diseases
- Serum transferrin level
- Half-life (t1/2) = 8-9 days
- Reflects protein status over the past 2 - 4 weeks
- Should be used **ONLY** in the setting of normal serum iron since it is affected by the iron status
- Measurement of immune function
- Total lymphocytes count
- Delayed hypersensitivity skin reaction

### III. Enteral nutrition

1. Overview
   ➡ Enteral nutrition refers to delivery of nutrient into the GIT

- GIT should be used whenever possible
  ➡ Types of tube-feeding technique - Feeding is discontinued for 4 -5 hours overnight to allow gastric pH to return to normal - Reduce incidence of nosocomial pneumonia and aspiration - Tube blockage is common - All tubes should be flushed with water at least twice daily - Instillation into tube with chymotrypsin or papain may salvage a partially obstructed tube

IV. Parenteral nutrition

1. Overview
   ➡Total parental nutrition (TPN)

- Defined as provision of all nutritional requirements including calories, electrolytes, minerals, vitamins, trace elements, amino acid and fluid by means of IV route without use of GI tract
- Indicated when energy and protein needs cannot be met by enteral administration of these substrates
  - Parental nutrition should be weaned and discontinued when > 60% of needs can be met via enteral nutrition
- Administered either by a catheter inserted in central vein or peripheral line
  ➡Peripheral feeding
- NOT indicated if patients already have an indwelling central venous line or in whom long-term feeding is anticipated
- Rarely indicated due to the ease of obtaining central access in the hospital, large volume required for parenteral nutrition and lack of benefit of short-term parenteral nutrition
- **Advantages:** Avoid complications associated with central venous administration
- **Disadvantages:** Limited by the development of thrombophlebitis
- Conventional short cannula in wrist veins - Infusion of nutritional requirements on a cyclical basis over 12 hours - Cannula is then removed and resited in the contralateral arm
  ➡Central feeding
- Parenteral nutrition given for more than a few days must be delivered via a central venous catheter because the high osmotic load is not tolerated by peripheral veins
  - Hyperosmolality is irritating to peripheral veins
- Catheter can be inserted into subclavian, internal (IJV) or external jugular vein (EJV)
  - Infra-clavicular subclavian approach is more suitable for feeding as catheter lies flat on chest wall
  - Exit site of IJV and EJV can be access easily but are inconveniently on the side of neck where repeated movement result in the disruption of dressing with risk of sepsis
  - Femoral site is the least desirable because there may be an increased risk of catheter-related infection associated with this site
- Peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) line
  - Catheter inserted into peripheral vein and maneuvered into the central venous system
  - Cannulate cephalic vein in arm which facilitates passage of catheter into brachiocephalic vein
  - Minimize risks of insertion into central venous system and ensures distance between site of skin entry and tip of catheter
  - Vein will be irrevocably destroyed if thrombophlebitis occurs
- Post-insertion CXR is **essential** before feeding is commenced - Confirm the absence of pneumothorax - Ensure catheter tip lies in the distal SVC to minimize risk of central venous thrombosis or cardiac thrombosis
  20

2. Constituents of TPN
   ➡Carbohydrate in the form of glucose (dextrose)

- High dextrose concentration given if administered through central vein
- Low dextrose concentration given if administered through peripheral vein with majority of calorie provided by fat emulsion instead
  ➡Protein in the form of amino acids
- Contains both essential and non-essential amino acids
  ➡Fat in the form of long-chain or medium-chain triglycerides
- Usually derived from soybean and safflower oils and the emulsified using egg phospholipids and glycerine
  ➡ Vitamins
  ➡ Electrolytes (Na/K/Ca/ Mg)
  ➡Trace elements

3. Indications for total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
   ➡Patients who cannot use the GIT properly

- Short gut syndrome\*
- Intestinal obstruction/ Paralytic ileus
- Tumours ( intestinal obstruction/ cancer cachexia/ increased demands)
- Inflammation of GIT
  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
- Mucositis of intestine following chemotherapy
- Radiation enteritis
  ➡Patients who have current or predicted inadequate increased demands + Unable to tolerate enteral feeding methods
- GI fistula\* ( malabsorption/increased loss)
- Hypercatabolic states
  - Sepsis
  - Major trauma
  - Severe burns
- Severe recurrent pancreatitis ( malabsorption/ hypercatabolic state)
- Liver failure with hepatic encephalopathy ( unable to feed enterally/ hypercatabolic state)
- Pre-operative nutritional build-up
  - Malnourished patient undergoing major surgery
  - Patient undergoing major surgery with expected post-operative NPO > 7 days
- Post-operative complications and cannot tolerate enteral feeding

Others
➡ Refeeding syndrome\*

- Defined as complications that can occur as a result of fluid and electrolyte shifts during aggressive nutritional rehabilitation of malnourished patients
- Hypophosphatemia is the hallmark of syndrome and the predominant cause of refeeding syndrome
  - Stores of PO4³⁻ are depleted during malnutrition and when nutritional replenishment starts glucose causes insulin release which triggers cellular uptake of phosphate
  - Insulin also causes cells to produce a variety of depleted molecules that require PO4³⁻ (e.g. ATP) which further depletes PO4³⁻ storage
  - Lack of phosphorylated intermediates causes tissue hypoxia and resultant myocardial dysfunction and respiratory failure due to inability of diaphragm to contract
- _Respiratory_ = Impaired diaphragmatic contraction
- _CVS_ = Peripheral edema/ Impaired myocardial contractility/ Decreased SV/ Arrhythmia/ Congestive heart failure
  - Insulin secretion increases renal Na⁺ reabsorption and retention
- _GI_ = Deranged LFT
  - Elevated serum aminotransferases due to excess calories and fat deposition or due to cell death-apoptosis from malnutrition
- _MSS_ = Rhabdomyolysis
  - Hypophosphatemia can cause rhabdomyolysis as evidence by increase in creatine kinase (CK)
- _CNS_ = Wernicke's encephalopathy (Thiamine deficiency)/ Seizure
  - Malnourished patient may be thiamine deficient at baseline and refeeding leads to intracellular uptake of electrolytes and thus increased utilization of thiamine
  - Wernicke's encephalopathy may occur with signs including encephalopathy, oculomotor dysfunction and gait ataxia
- _Hematology_ = Hemolysis
- _Endocrine_ = Hypophosphatemia/ Hypokalemia/ Thiamine deficiency
  ➡ TPN-related cholestasis + Acalculous cholecystitis\*
- Prolonged insufficient gut stimulation leading to reduced bile outflow and subsequent cholecystitis

I. Overview

1. Background
   ➡Body composition

- Total body fluid = 60% of body weight in adult males
  - 50% in adult females
  - 80% in infants (65% by 1 year of age)
- Intracellular fluid volume = 2/3 of total body fluid
- Extracellular fluid volume = 1/3 of total body fluid
  - Interstitial space = 3/4 of extracellular fluid volume
  - Intravascular volume = 1/4 of extracellular fluid volume

II. Principles of fluid management

1. Calculation of fluid replacement
   ➡Fluid resuscitation

- Adults = 10 mL/kg (assume a bolus of 500 mL in 50 kg patient)
- Children = 20 mL/kg
  ➡Fluid replacement
- = Prior fluid deficit + Maintenance fluid requirement + Ongoing or anticipated loss
  ➡Prior fluid deficit = Weight x % dehydration = **\_\_\_**/L
  ➡Maintenance fluid requirement

| Weight                                       | Fluid requirement (2 version) |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1st 10 kg                                    | 4 mL/kg/hr                    | 100 mL/kg/day |
| 2nd 10 kg                                    | 2 mL/kg/hr                    | 50 mL/kg/day  |
| Each extra kg                                | 1 mL/kg/hr                    | 20 mL/kg/day  |
| Remarks:↑ 10% fluid for every 1°C above 37°C |                               |

➡ Ongoing or anticipated loss

- Blood loss
- GI loss
  - Vomiting and diarrhea
  - Nasogastric aspirate
  - Stoma and surgical drains
- 3rd space loss
  - Pathological expansion of interstitial space via capillary leak in response to injury and illnesses (e.g. pancreatitis, peritonitis, septicaemia)

2. Clinical fluid replacement
   ➡ Standard therapy = 2D1S Q8H for all patients

- 5% Dextrose
- 0.9% Normal saline

3. Rate of fluid administration
   ➡Fluid bolus

- Indicated in patients with hypovolemic shock for resuscitation
- Establish 2 peripheral large bore (14 Gauge) IV cannula
- Run 1L 0.9% NS full-rate
  - 0.45% NS or Ringer's lactate for large volume resuscitation
    ➡Fluid replacement
- Replace 1/2 of fluid requirement in first 8 hours
- Followed by remaining 1/2 of fluid requirement over next 16 hours

➡ Normal saline (NS)

- Represents solutions of water and electrolytes and hence other ions such as K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ can be added to suit electrolyte requirement when necessary
- Particularly useful in cases of hyponatremia, hypochloremia and metabolic alkalosis
- Sterile water is **NOT** used over NS since it will cause hemolysis due to its hypotonicity
- Different concentration of NS

| Concentration    | Tonicity   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

# III. Electrolyte replacement

➡ Dextrose (D5: 5% Dextrose) (D5/10/20/50)

- Function as both volume expander and parenteral nutrition
- Glucose is rapidly metabolized by liver into H2O and the remaining water will distribute itself across all compartments with minimal fluid remaining within intravascular space and hence **NOT** used for fluid resuscitation

➡Lactated Ringer (Hartmann's solution)

- Serum osmolality = 2[Na+] + [K+] + [urea] + [glucose] (Normal: 285 – 295 mmol/kg)
  - Osmolality of Lactated Ringer (Hartmann's solution) = 278 mmol/kg
- Used to replace fluid with the ionic composition of plasma including blood loss, edema fluid and small bowel loss
- Ideal for replacement of existing fluid deficit when serum electrolyte concentration are normal
- Lactate in lactated Ringer's will be converted to bicarbonate which serves as a buffer
- Risk of hyponatremia or hyperkalemia with extended use and in patients with impaired renal function

➡ Albumin (5%/10%/ 20%)

- Increases oncotic pressure and benefit of promoting retention of fluid in intravascular space and reduce excess interstitial fluid (edema)
- Caution in patients whose condition is secondary to microvascular abnormalities such has ARDS, burns and sepsis
  - Exogenous administration of proteins in colloids can extravasate into interstitial space and intensity interstitial edema

| ➡ Usually included in fluid replacement already |
| K+                                              | 0.5–1.0 mmol/kg/day | 3.6–5.0 mmol/L      | ➡ Predominantly intracellular |
| ➡ Prone to deficiency                           |
| Ca2+                                            | 5 mmol/day          | 2.11–2.55 mmol/L    | ➡ Usually stable              |
| Mg2+                                            | 1 mmol/day          | 0.7–1.1 mmol/L      | ➡ Usually stable              |

2. Correction of hyponatremia
   ➡ Na+ deficit = Total body weight x Correction factor x (Desired serum Na+ - Actual serum Na+)

- Correction factor: Males = 0.6; Females = 0.5; Children = 0.6
- Desired serum Na+ = 136–148 mmol/L

3. Correction of hypernatremia
   ➡ Body water deficit (L) = Total body weight x Correction factor x [(Actual serum Na+ / 140) – 1]

- Correction factor: Males = 0.6; Females = 0.5; Children = 0.6
- Replace 1/2 of body water deficit over first 24 hours
- Replace remaining body water deficit over next 1 – 2 days

## Shock

I. Overview

1. Definition and terminology
   ➡ Shock
   - Defined as a state of **cellular and tissue hypoxia** due to reduced O2 delivery, increased O2 consumption or inadequate O2 utilization
   - Tissue hypoperfusion is recognized clinically by
     - Skin: Decreased capillary refill/ Cool and pale skin
     - Renal: Decreased urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/hr
     - CNS: Anxiety/ Lethargy/ Confusion
   - Commonly occurs when there is circulatory failure and manifest as hypotension - Patients in the early stages of shock can be normotensive or hypertensive so hypotension does **NOT** have to be present for diagnosis of shock - Patients who have hypotension does **NOT** necessarily have shock such as patients with chronic hypotension, drug-induced hypotension, autonomic dysfunction, vasovagal syncope and peripheral artery disease
     ➡ Hypotension - Defined as absolute, relative and orthostatic - Absolute = SBP < 90 mmHg (OR) MAP < 65 mmHg - Relative = Reduction in SBP > 40 mmHg from baseline - Orthostatic = Reduction in SBP > 20 mmHg (OR) DBP > 10 mmHg on standing

➡Neurogenic shock

- Occurs in patients with traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury
- Interruption of autonomic pathways leading to loss of sympathetic tone and unopposed vagal tone
- Differentiated from spinal shock
  - NOT a true shock
  - Physiological loss of all spinal cord function below level of lesion immediately after a spinal cord injury with subsequent recovery
  - Spinal shock is over when bulbocavernosus and anal wink reflex has returned
  - Presents with bladder and bowel dysfunction, flaccid (_acute_) or spastic (_chronic_) paralysis, hyporeflexia (_acute_) or hyperreflexia (_chronic_)
  - Presents with bradycardia, hypotension and hypothermia (Lesion from C1 – T1 sympathetic disruption) or respiratory arrest (Lesion above C3) or diaphragmatic without intercostal muscle breathing (Lesion below C5)

➡Anaphylactic shock

- Anaphylaxis refers severe systemic allergic reaction to an antigen precipitated by abrupt release of chemical mediators in a previously sensitized patient
- Anaphylactoid reaction refers to direct histamine release from mast cells without need for prior sensitization
- Presents with urticaria (rash), angioedema or bronchospasm
- Common causes for anaphylactic shock
  - Drugs: Penicillin/ Aspirin/ NSAIDs/ Colloids/ TCM
  - Food: Peanuts/ Egg/ Shellfish
  - Venoms: Bees/ Wasp/ Hornets
  - Environment: Latex/ Dust/ Pollen grains
  - Infections: EBV/ HBV/ Coxsackie virus/ Parasites

II. **Treatment**

1. General approach (ABC)
   ➡ Airway

- Ensure patency of airway and intubate if necessary
  ➡ Breathing
- 100% O2 supplementation with non-rebreather mask
  ➡ Circulation
- Establish 2 large bore (14 – 16 Gauge) peripheral IV cannula
- Fluid resuscitation with crystalloid
- Blood transfusion when Hb < 7 g/dL
- ± Inotropes and vasopressors
  - Epinephrine: Initial agent in anaphylactic shock
  - Norepinephrine: Initial agent in hypovolemic and septic shock
  - Dobutamine: Initial agent in cardiogenic shock

➡ Monitoring

- Vital signs = HR/ BP/ RR/ Temperature/ SaO2
- Urine output with indwelling Foley catheter
- CXR/ ECG

2. Anaphylactic shock
   ➡ General management

- **STOP** administration of suspected agent
- Activated charcoal or gastric lavage if drug is ingested
- Secure airway with endotracheal intubation or emergency cricothyroidotomy
- Fluid resuscitation with crystalloids such as NS or Hartmann's solution

## Sepsis

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Sepsis is a clinical syndrome that has physiologic, biologic and biochemical abnormalities caused by a dysregulated inflammatory response to infection
   ➡Sepsis and the inflammatory response that ensues can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death
   ➡ Continuum of severity

- Infection → Bacteremia → Sepsis → Septic shock → Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) → Death
- Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is no longer included in the definition
  - SIRS is not always caused by infection
- Severe sepsis which originally refers to sepsis that was associated with tissue hypoperfusion or organ dysfunction is no longer included in the definition
  - Septic shock and sepsis definition (2016) have included patients with evidence of tissue hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction

2. Definition
   ➡ Infection

- Invasion of normally sterile tissue by organisms resulting in infectious pathology
  ➡ Bacteremia
- Presence of viable bacteria in blood
  ➡ Sepsis
- Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection
- Organ dysfunction
  - Defined as an increase of ≥ 2 points in the SOFA score consequent to the infection
- Infection - No clear guidelines to identify presence of infection or to causally link an identified organism with sepsis - Reliant upon clinical suspicion derived from signs and symptoms of infection and supporting radiological and microbiological data and response to therapy
  ➡ Severe sepsis
- Defined as sepsis that is complicated by organ dysfunction
  ➡ Septic shock
- Type of vasodilatory or distributive shock
- Defined as a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and cellular or metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality
- Clinically identified by persisting hypotension despite adequate volume resuscitation with the following features
  - Vasopressor requirement to maintain MAP > 65 mmHg
  - Lactate level > 2 mmol/L (> 18 mg/dL)

[Image: Page number 34 at the bottom right.]

➡Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)

- Progressive organ dysfunction in an acutely ill patient such that homeostasis cannot be maintained without intervention
- Severe end of the severity of illness spectrum of both infectious (e.g. sepsis and septic shock) and non-infectious conditions (e.g. SIRS in pancreatitis)
- MODS can be classified as primary or secondary
  - Primary MODS = Result of a well-defined insult in which organ dysfunction occurs early and can be directly attributable to the insult itself (e.g. acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis)
  - Secondary MODS = Organ failure that is not in direct response to the insult itself but is a consequence of the host's response (e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with pancreatitis)

➡Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)

- Note that the term SIRS is **NO LONGER** used since 2016 sepsis and septic shock definition include patients with evidence of tissue hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction
- Use of SIRS criteria to identify patient with sepsis has fallen out of favour since it is considered by many experts that
  - SIRS criteria are present in many hospitalized patients who do not develop infection
  - Its ability to predict death is poor when compared to scores such as SOFA score
- Widespread inflammatory response that may or may not be associated with infection
  - Non-infectious conditions classically associated with SIRS include pancreatitis, autoimmune disorders, vasculitis, thromboembolism, burns or surgery
- Presence of ≥ 2 of the following criteria (one of which must be abnormal temperature or leukocyte count) (Temperature + HR + RR + WBC count)
  - Temperature > 38°C or < 36°C
  - HR > 90 bpm
  - RR > 20/min (OR) PaCO2 < 32 mmHg (4.3 kPa)
  - WBC count > 12000/mm³ or < 4000/mm³ or > 10% immature bands

35

II. Etiology

1. Risk factors of sepsis
   ➡Demographics

- Advanced age ≥ 65
- Genetic susceptibility to infection
- Previous hospitalization
  - Altered human microbiome especially when treated with antibiotics
- Intensive care unit admission
  - Risk of nosocomial infection
    ➡ Medical history
- Bacteremia
- Community acquired pneumonia
- Diabetes mellitus
- Malignancy
- Immunosuppression

III. Clinical presentation

1. Non-specific signs and symptoms
   ➡Fever or hypothermia

- Temperature > 38.3°C or < 36°C
  ➡ Tachycardia
- HR > 90 bpm or > 2 SD above normal value for age
  ➡ Tachypnea
- RR > 20 breaths per min
  ➡Arterial hypotension
- SBP < 90 mmHg or < 2 SD below normal value for age
- Decrease in SBP > 40 mmHg
- Mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 70 mmHg

2. Signs of end-organ hypoperfusion
   ➡ **Vascular** system

- Warm and flushed skin in early phase of sepsis
- Cool skin with mottling, cyanosis, decreased capillary refill with redirection of blood flow to core organs and progression to shock
  ➡**Gastrointestinal** system
- Diminished or absence of bowel sound
  ➡**Renal** system
- Oliguria or anuria
  ➡ **CNS** system
- Altered mental status, obtundation or restlessness

3. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)
   [Table with 6 rows and 2 columns. The first row is a header row. The first column is labeled "System". The second column is labeled "Pathology".
   The second row contains "Respiratory system" and "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)".
   The third row contains "Cardiovascular system" and "Septic shock".
   The fourth row contains "Hepatic system" and "Jaundice/ GI bleeding/ Paralytic ileus".

   The sixth row contains "Neurological system" and "Septic encephalopathy/ Critical illness polyneuropathy".
   The seventh row contains "Hematological system" and "Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC)".]

36

IV. **Diagnosis**

1. Biochemical tests (Septic workup)
   ➡ CBC with differentials - Leukocytosis - Leukopenia - Bone marrow suppression in sepsis - Normal WBC with > 10% immature forms - Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) - Thrombocytopenia - Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC)
   ➡ Clotting profile - Coagulation abnormalities in disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) - INR > 1.5 or aPTT > 60s
   ➡ Electrolyte profile - Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in adrenal insufficiency - Initial inflammatory response to sepsis activates endogenous release of cortisol to restrict
   inflammation in infected tissues
   ➡ Plasma BG level - Hyperglycemia in the absence of DM - Hyperglycemia associated with critical illness (stress hyperglycemia) - ↑ Catecholamine, glucagon, cortisol and growth hormones - ↑ Gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis
   ➡ Inflammatory markers - ↑ ESR and CRP levels
   ➡ Serum LDH level - Hyperlactatemia can be a manifestation of organ hypoperfusion in the presence or
   absence of hypotension - Important component of evaluation since elevated LDH is associated with poor prognosis - Serum LDH ≥ 4 mmol/L is consistent with but not diagnostic of septic shock
   ➡ Serum bilirubin level - Hyperbilirubinemia can be caused by sepsis through intravascular hemolysis
   ➡ Urinalysis - Look for pyuria and bacteriuria
   ⇨ RFT - ↑ Serum creatinine in renal failure - Monitoring of urine output to look for oliguria or anuria
   ➡ Arterial blood gas (ABG) - Metabolic acidosis - Arterial hypoxemia - PaO2/FiO2 < 300
   ➡ Blood culture
   ➡ Sputum culture
   ➡ Urine culture
   ➡ Stool culture
   ➡ Evaluation of other source of infection - Throat swab - CSF by lumbar puncture - Arthrocentesis - Paracentesis - Pleural fluid analysis

37

V. **Treatment**

1. Initial management
   ➡ Airway and breathing

- Supplemental O2 should be supplied to all patients
- Oxygenation should be monitored continuously with pulse oximetry
- Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required
  - Support the increased work of breathing that typically accompanies sepsis
  - Airway protection since encephalopathy and depressed level of consciousness frequently complicates sepsis
- CXR and ABG should be obtained following initial stabilization - Evaluate for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
  ➡ Circulation
- Assessment of perfusion
  - Measure BP to look for hypotension
  - Look for signs of end-organ hypoperfusion
  - Elevated serum LDH level
- Establishment of venous access
  - Peripheral venous access may be sufficient in some patients for initial resuscitation but majority will eventually require central venous access
  - Hemodynamic monitoring by measuring central venous pressure (CVP) and central venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (ScvO2)

2. Targets for resuscitation
   ➡ Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) targets

- EGDT refers to administration of IV fluid within the first 6 hours of presentation using physiologic targets to guide fluid management
  ➡ Components of EGDT
- Urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hour
- Mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg
  - MAP = [2 x (diastolic) + systolic] / 3
- Central venous pressure = 8 – 12 mmHg (with central access) (**OR**) respiratory changes in the radial artery pulse pressure
  - Static predictors of fluid responsiveness = Central venous pressure (CVP)
  - Dynamic predictors of fluid responsiveness = Respiratory changes in radial artery pulse pressure
- Central venous (SVC) oxyhemoglobin saturation (ScvO2) ≥ 70% (with central access) (**OR**) mixed venous oxyhemoglobin saturation ≥ 65% (with pulmonary artery catheter)

38

3. Interventions to restore perfusion
   ➡Intravenous fluid administration

- Crystalloid is the preferred solution to manage patients with volume depletion not due to bleeding

➡RBC transfusion

- One of the alternative therapy which has conflicting evidence on usage
- Reserved for patients with Hb level ≤ 7 g/dL (Restrictive transfusion strategy)
- Restrictive transfusion strategy (≤7 g/dL) shows non-inferiority and no difference in mortality compared with liberal (≤ 10 g/dL) transfusion strategy but benefits from fewer RBC transfusion

[Image of page number 39 in the bottom right corner]

➡ Vasopressors

- 2nd line agents in treatment of sepsis and septic shock
- Indicated in patients who remain hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation (e.g. ≥ 4 L of fluid resuscitation) or evidence of fluid overload is present
- Norepinephrine (drug of choice) = 1 µg/kg/min
- Dopamine (2nd line) = 5-20 µg/kg/min
  ➡ Inotropes
- One of the alternative therapy which has conflicting evidence on usage
- Indicated in patients who have refractory shock who have diminished CO
- Dobutamine
  - Low dose dobutamine decreases BP because of peripheral vasodilation effect
  - High dose increases BP because CO increases out of proportion to the fall in peripheral vascular resistance

[Table with Adrenoreceptors showing effects on alpha1, alpha2, beta1, and beta2 receptors. The first row contains the headers a1-receptor, a2-receptor, beta1-receptor, beta2-receptor. The second row shows that a1-receptor stimulation leads to increased TPR and vasoconstriction. The third row shows that a2-receptor stimulation leads to decreased insulin release. The fourth row shows that a1-receptor stimulation leads to mydriasis and increased closure of the internal sphincter of the urinary bladder. The fifth row shows that a2-receptor stimulation leads to inhibition of NE release and inhibition of ACh release. The sixth row shows that beta1-receptor stimulation leads to increased HR, increased myocardial contractility, increased lipolysis, and increased renin release. The seventh row shows that beta2-receptor stimulation leads to decreased TPR, vasodilation, increased glycogenolysis from the liver and muscle, increased glucagon release, bronchodilation, and relaxation of uterine smooth muscle.]

4. Treatment of septic focus
   ➡ Prompt identification and treatment of primary sites or sites of infection are the primary
   therapeutic intervention with most other interventions being supportive only
   ➡ Identification of septic focus

- Blood should be drawn from 2 distinct venepuncture sites and inoculated into standard
  blood culture media (aerobic and anaerobic)
- Blood should be obtained both through catheter and from another site in patients with
  vascular catheter
  ➡ Eradication of infection
- Antibiotics should be administered within the first 6 hours of presentation or earlier after
  obtaining blood culture
- Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage when potential pathogen or infection source is not
  immediately obvious
- Vancomycin is used since S. aureus infection is associated with significant morbidity if
  not treated early in the course of infection - Increasing causes of sepsis due to MRSA and thus vancomycin is used to treat
  patients presenting with sepsis of unclear etiology until possibility of MRSA
  sepsis has been excluded
- Regimen if P. aeruginosa is unlikely
  - Vancomycin (AND) one of the following
    - ẞ-lactam/ ẞ-lactamase inhibitor (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam/ ticarcillin-
      clavulanate) (OR)
    - 3rd/4th generation cephalosporin (e.g. cephalosporin/ cefotaxime/ cefepime) (OR)
  - Carbapenem (e.g. imipenem/ meropenem)
- Regimen if P. aeruginosa is likely
  - Vancomycin (AND) two of the following
    - Anti-pseudomonal ẞ-lactam/ ẞ-lactamase inhibitor (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam/
      ticarcillin-clavulanate) (OR)
    - Anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin (e.g. ceftazidime/ cefepime) (OR)
    - Anti-pseudomonal carbapenem (e.g. imipenem/ carbapenem) (OR)
  - Fluoroquinolone with good anti-pseudomonal activity (e.g. ciprofloxacin) (OR)
  - Aminoglycoside (e.g. gentamicin/ amikacin) (OR)
  - Monobactam (e.g. aztreonam)

5. Other adjuvant therapy
   ➡ Glucocorticoids

- Based on the pathogenesis of sepsis involves an intense and potentially deleterious host
  inflammatory response
- Useful in patients who are unresponsive to adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor
  administration (refractory vasopressor-dependent shock)
  ➡ Insulin
- Target BG level: ≤ 10 mmol/L
- Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are common in critically ill patients independent of
  a history of DM
  ➡ Antipyretics or external cooling
- External cooling consists of either an automatic cooling blanket or ice-cold bed sheets
  and icepacks - Achieve a core body temperature of 36.5°C -37°C for 48 hours - Decreases the time for fever control without exposing the patient to potential
  adverse effects of antipyretic drugs

VI. Prognosis (Predictive scoring system)

1. Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
   ➡SOFA score is an organ dysfunction score

- Only identify patients who potentially have a high risk of dying from infection
- NOT diagnostic of sepsis NOR does it identify those whose organ dysfunction is truly due to infection
  ➡Designed to sequentially assess the severity of organ dysfunction in patients who are critically ill from sepsis
- Allows early identification of patients potentially at risk of dying from sepsis
  ➡Uses simple measurements of major organ function to calculate a severity score
- Scores are calculated 24 hours after admission to ICU and every 48 hours thereafter
- The mean and the highest scores are most predictive of mortality
- Increase in SOFA score ≥ 2 is associated with a mortality of ≥ 10%
  ➡ Components of SOFA severity score

| System                | Parameters                                                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Respiratory system    | Ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) |
| Cardiovascular system | Amount of vasoactive medication necessary to prevent hypotension            |
| Hepatic system        | Bilirubin level                                                             |
| Renal system          | Serum creatinine or urine output                                            |
| Neurological system   | Glasgow Coma Score (GCS)                                                    |
| Coagulation system    | Platelet concentration                                                      |

[Image Description: The image contains a table with two columns: System and Parameters. The rows in the table list different organ systems and their corresponding parameters used in the SOFA severity score calculation. The organ systems listed are Respiratory, Cardiovascular, Hepatic, Renal, Neurological, and Coagulation.

# Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC)

I. Overview

[Image Description: A flowchart illustrating the pathogenesis of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy (DIC). The flowchart begins with "UNDERLYING CONDITION" at the top, which leads to "Activation of intravascular coagulation". From "Activation of intravascular coagulation", there are four branches: "Platelet consumption", "Coagulation Factor consumption", "Fibrin deposition fibrinolysis", and "Endothelial damage". "Platelet consumption" leads to "↓ platelets" (decreased platelets), "Coagulation Factor consumption" leads to "↑ PT ↑ aPTT" (increased Prothrombin Time and activated Partial Thromboplastin Time), "Fibrin deposition fibrinolysis" leads to "↑ D-dimer ↑ FDPs MAHA" (increased D-dimer and Fibrin Degradation Products and Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia), and "Endothelial damage" directly leads to "Activation of intravascular coagulation" creating a circular reference. From "↓ platelets" and "↑ PT ↑ aPTT" the flowchart points to "Impaired coagulation" then down to "BLEEDING". From "↑ D-dimer ↑ FDPs MAHA" and "Endothelial damage" the flowchart points to "Thrombosis" then down to "ORGAN ISCHEMIA".]

➡General features

- Systemic process with potential for causing thrombosis and hemorrhage
  - Processes of coagulation and fibrinolysis becomes abnormally and massively activated within the vasculature leading to ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis

➡ Pathogenesis

- Widespread activation of coagulation
  - Intravascular formation of fibrin
  - Thrombotic occlusion of small vessels
  - Leads to multiple organ failure
- Depletion of platelets and clotting factors
  - Widespread intravascular coagulation and secondary fibrinolysis
  - Consumption of clotting factors, inhibitors of coagulation and platelets

➡Treatment
• General principle
○ Precipitating trigger must be eliminated before treatment of DIC is effective
○ Control of bleeding with frequent monitoring of coagulation screen is essential
• Management
○ Platelet and fresh frozen plasma (FFP): Supportive therapy
○ Anti-coagulants: Not favourable
○ Anti-thrombin concentrate (natural coagulation inhibitor): Not favourable

## Tubes and drains

I. **Overview**

1. General features

[Image Description: This is an illustration of a surgical drain. It shows a red cavity being drained by a tube with multiple holes. The tube has two ends, labeled I.D. (Inner Diameter) and O.D. (Outer Diameter). The I.D. end is inside the cavity, and the O.D. end is outside. Below is a graphic illustrating the French Catheter Scale from 5 Fr to 10 Fr, showing the corresponding diameters in millimeters.]

French Catheter Scale
5 Fr 6 Fr 7 Fr 8 Fr 9 Fr 10 Fr
1.66 mm 2.0 mm 2.33 mm 2.66 mm 3.0 mm 3.33mm
1 French gauge has an outer diameter of 1/3 mm.
So Diameter (mm) = Fr / 3

➡ Size is indicated by French (1 Fr = 0.3 mm)

II. Vascular access (CVP/ PICC/ Hickman line/ Port-A-Cath)

1. Overview
   ➡ Seldinger technique

- Refers to the use of a guidewire placed into a vessel to provide a conduit for intravascular device placement

2. Central venous catheter and PICC

[Image Description: A photo of a man lying down with lines overlaid that point to his External Jugular Vein, Path of IJ, Clavicular Head of SCM, Clavicle and Sternal Head of SCM, all of which are labeled.]

[Image Description: A line drawing of the Central Venous Lines showing Entrance sites with Plastic catheters going to the Heart. The Central Veins and Central Arteries are shown and labeled. The routes are labeled a-Subclavian, b-Jugular. The drawing is labeled as Figure 1.]
46

➡Catheter is placed into major veins including internal jugular, subclavian or femoral vein

- IJV access is associated with minimal risk of pneumothorax and lower failure rate
  especially under USG-guidance
  - **Landmarks of IJV:** Palpation of 2 origins of SCM (_sternal and clavicular head_)
    defines a triangular gap just above the medial clavicle and IJV normally courses
    deep to the muscle and emerges along the medial border of the clavicular head
- Subclavian access is associated with lower risk of catheter-related infection but higher
  rate of insertion failure and pneumothorax
  ➡Peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) line
- Catheter inserted into peripheral vein and maneuvered into the central venous system
- Cannulate cephalic vein in arm which facilitates passage of catheter into brachiocephalic
  vein
- Minimize risks of insertion into central venous system and ensures distance between site
  of skin entry and tip of catheter
- Vein will be irrevocably destroyed if thrombophlebitis occurs
  ➡ Normal physiology
- Normal CVP < 10 mmHg (usually 2 - 6 mmHg)
- Causes of↑ CVP
  - Overhydration which increases venous return
  - HF which limits venous outflow and lead to venous congestion
  - Positive pressure ventilation (PPV)
  - Straining
- Causes of ↓ CVP
  - Dehydration
  - Hypovolemic shock
  - Fluid shift
    ➡ Indications
- CVP monitoring
- Assess RV function and systemic fluid status
- Serial venous blood assessment
- Administration of fluid or medications
  - Rapid infusion
  - Infusion of hypertonic solutions and medications that damage veins
- Hemodialysis
  [Image Description: The number 47 is located at the bottom right corner of the page.]

   • Risk of esophageal perforation
   ➡Esophageal varices
   • Risk of triggering variceal bleeding which can be life-threatening
   ➡Severe facial injury
   ➡Skull base fracture
   • Risk of intracranial misplacement

III. Procedures

1. Technique
   ➡Local anesthetic spray such as lidocaine is applied to help control gag reflex and ease discomfort
   associated with tube placement
   ➡Patient should be seated with the head tilted towards the chest
   ➡Estimate the length of NG tube for it to reach the stomach
   • From nose to tip of ears to xiphoid process as the initial length of NG tube insertion
   ➡Tube is lubricated and introduced into one of the nares and advanced horizontally
   • Contralateral nostril is used if there is presence of any resistance
   • Blind placement should be avoided in intubated patients due to risk of placing the tube
   into the lungs
   o Laryngoscope should be used to advance the nasogastric tube into esophagus
   under direct vision
   ➡Stop before reaching the posterior nasopharynx and patient is asked to swallow as the tube is
   being advanced
   • Patient may feel like gagging when tube reaches nasopharynx or in case the tube has
   entered the trachea it should be immediately withdrawn
   • Take advantage of the swallowing mechanism to help passage of tube into esophagus and
   then into the stomach
   ➡Confirmation of placement of tube
   • Auscultation of epigastrium during air injection (Clinical)
   o 5 mL of air is injected and use stethoscope to confirm bubbling from the stomach
   o Sound generated by air blown through the tube producing a gurgling sound
   o NOT accurate since the tube position can be in too far or not in far enough
   • pH test of gastric aspirate (Biochemical)
   o Lumen of tube is aspiration and tested with pH paper
   o Aspirate pH ≤ 5 in majority of cases
   o NOT accurate in patients receiving acid suppression agents
   • CXR (Radiological)
   o Tube bisects the carina
   o Tube crosses the diaphragm in the midline
   o Tip of the tube should sits below the diaphragm
   o Tip of the tube should be at least 10 cm beyond gastro-esophageal junction (OGJ)
   ➡Manipulation of tube
   • Tubes for decompression are positioned in the gastric fundus and connected to low
   intermittent wall suction which decreases injury to gastric mucosa
   • Tubes for enteric nutrition are positioned in the antrum, duodenum or jejunum
   ➡Tube fixation
   • Tube should be taped securely to the nose
   ➡Checking of tube function
   • Tube should be checked frequently by irrigating the tube with water every 4 - 8 hours

IV. Complications

1. Complications of NG/NJ tube

| Category    | Complications         |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Respiratory | ➡Tracheal perforation |

➡Pneumothorax
➡Pneumonia

- Intubation into the lung and inadvertent administration of medications, radiocontrast media or enteral formula through the tube
- Aspiration pneumonia due to gastric reflux
  ➡Nasal alar ulceration or necrosis
- Improper securing the tube or placement of large tube in unconscious patient who cannot convey his discomfort leads to pressure ulcers and alar necrosis
- Frequent retaping to decrease pressure on any particular point can help to prevent this complication |
  | Gastrointestinal | ➡Esophageal or gastric perforation
  ➡Esophagitis/ Esophageal stricture
- Presence of NG tube impairs normal function of lower esophageal sphincter which predisposes to gastric reflux
  ➡Gastritis/Gastric bleeding
- Result of chronic irritation or pressure necrosis due to suctioning of gastrointestinal mucosa |

# Endotracheal intubation

I. Overview

1. General features

- ➡ Endotracheal intubation is achieved with direct laryngoscopy
- ➡Rapid-sequence intubation (RSI)
  - Simultaneous administration of a sedative (induction) and neuromuscular blocking (paralytic) agent to render a patient rapidly unconscious and flaccid in order to facilitate emergency ETT intubation to minimize the risk of aspiration

2. Comparison with tracheostomy

|                   | Endotracheal (ET) tube        | Tracheostomy                                            |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Advantages**    | ➡Easier and quicker insertion | ➡ Ease of suctioning                                    |
|                   | ➡Lack of surgical procedure   | ➡ Ease of replacement                                   |

- ➡Inadequate oxygenation
- ➡Inadequate ventilation
  - Prolonged respiratory effort resulting in fatigue as in status asthmaticus or severe COPD
- ➡Airway protection in patients with decreased mental status (GCS)
  - Patients with decreased consciousness and loss of airway reflex will fail to protect airway against aspiration
- ➡Patient receiving general anesthesia (GA)

2. Contraindications

- ➡Trauma to the upper airway
- ➡Total upper airway obstruction

55

III. Procedures

1. STOP MAID mnemonics for ETT intubation
   ➡S: Suction
   ➡T: Tools for intubation
   • Direct laryngoscope
   ➡0: Oxygen

   ➡P: Positioning
   ➡M: Monitors
   • Includes ECG, pulse oximeter, BP monitor, EtCO2 and esophageal detectors
   A: Assistant
   • Ambu bag with face mask (Bag-mask ventilation)
   • Laryngeal mask airway (LMA)
   I: IV access
   • Two peripheral IV catheter should be placed to ensure IV access in case one becomes
   non-functioning
   ⇨ D: Drugs
   • For pre-treatment, induction and neuromuscular blockade (NMB)

56

2. Technique of intubation
   ➡Positioning the patient

- Classic "sniffing" position meaning atlanto-occipital extension with head elevation
- Head elevation is deemed adequate when the external auditory meatus is at the level of the sternal notch when viewed from the side - Leads to flexion of lower cervical and upper thoracic spine - Position is achieved by using linens or specially designed beds to create a ramp
  ➡Patient is mildly sedated and intubated using topical anesthesia
  ➡Open the patient's mouth and carefully position the laryngoscope
- Deflect the tongue and soft tissues to the left side of the mouth with the flange
  ➡Locate the epiglottis
- Identify and optimize the view of glottis
- Guide the ETT to the glottis and insert through the vocal cords into trachea
  - Males: Depth of insertion = 22-23 cm from incisors or gums
  - Females: Depth of insertion = 20-21 cm from incisors or gums
- Remove the stylet and inflate the ETT balloon
  ➡Confirmation of the position of ETT in trachea and exclusion of esophageal intubation
- Rise of bilateral chest wall with positive pressure ventilation
- Mist in ETT with each exhalation
- 5-point auscultation
  - Epigastrium for **ABSENCE** of breath sounds
  - Anterior chest at bilateral MCL for **EQUAL** breath sounds
  - Axilla at bilateral MAL for **EQUAL** breath sounds (avoid being misled by transmitted breath sounds)
- Chest radiograph (CXR)
  - AP view to determine depth of ETT in the trachea
  - Cuff size should not be larger than the trachea diameter since overinflation of cuff will lead to tracheomalacia and tracheal stenosis
  - Inferior tip should be at least superior to the carina optimal position = 1 inch (~2 cm) above carina
  - Endobronchial (too deep) insertion into mainstem bronchus will lead to one-lung ventilation and thus hypoxia, hypercapnia and pneumothorax
  - Supraglottic (too shallow) insertion will lead to damage to vocal cord and arytenoid dislocation during cuff inflation at level of larynx
  - NOT placed just above carina since flexion and extension of the neck can easily dislodge the tube upwards or downwards
- End-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2)
  - **MOST** accurate means of confirming ETT placement in trachea
  - Either quantitative capnography or colorimetric is used
  - ≥ 5 exhalations with a consistent CO2 level must be evident before one can confidently assume that ETT is in the trachea
  - Patients in cardiac arrest may not generate CO2 making CO2 detection unhelpful
- Ultrasound (USG) - Subject of ongoing study to assess ETT placement - Presence of "lung sliding sign" which refers to movement of pleural membranes as lung expands and contracts in **BOTH** lungs to signify proper ventilation
  ➡Secure the ET tube
- Secure with tape or commercially available tube holders
  ➡Set parameters for mechanical ventilation

3. **7Ps mnemonics for RSI**
   ➡ Preparation

- Assess patient airway and potential difficulty for intubation
  - Difficulty to intubate
  - Difficulty to ventilate using a bag-mask
  - Difficulty to use a rescue airway device such as LMA
- Develop an airway management and backup plan
  - Alternatives to RSI includes an "awake technique" in which patient is mildly sedated and intubated using topical anesthesia but is **NOT** induced and paralyzed
- Bag-mask, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airway should be at the bedside
- 2 function IV lines, pulse oximetry and BP monitors should be in placed
  ➡Preoxygenation
- High flow oxygen at highest possible concentration
- Performed most commonly using a facemask with an oxygen reservoir
- Preoxygenation is required to permit a longer period of apnea without clinically significant oxygen desaturation
  ➡ Pre-treatment
- Administration of medications prior to induction phase of RSI for the purpose of reducing adverse effects associated with ET intubation
  ➡Paralysis with induction
- Simultaneous IV administration of rapidly acting sedative (induction) agent and neuromuscular blockade (paralytic) agent
  - Sedation (induction) to provide state of unconsciousness and analgesics
  - Neuromuscular blockade (paralytic) agent to achieve flaccidity in order to facilitate intubation and minimize risk of aspiration
- Aims at producing in state of deep sedation and muscular relaxation quickly
- Sedative (induction) agent = Propofol/ Thiopental/ Etomidate/ Ketamine
- Neuromuscular blockade (paralytic) agent = Succinylcholine/ Rocuronium
  ➡Protection and positioning
- Sellick's maneuver
  - Apply cricoid pressure to prevent passive regurgitation
  - Performed using thumb and index or middle finger to apply firm downward pressure on cricoid cartilage to compress esophagus between cricoid cartilage and anterior surface of vertebral body
- Bag-mask ventilation is **AVOIDED** during interval between drug administration and ETT placement to minimize gastric insufflation and resulting aspiration - Ventilation interposed between paralysis and intubation creates a potential hazard if stomach insufflation results in regurgitation and aspiration - Ventilatory support using a bag-mask is **ONLY** indicated when oxygen saturation < 90% and should be performed while maintaining cricoid pressure
  ➡Placement with proof
- ETT intubation after flaccidity is achieved assessed by masseter muscle tone - Laxity of jaw with no resistance to mouth opening - Confirmation of ETT tube placement
  ➡Postintubation management
- Secure of ETT with tape or tube holders
- Initiation of mechanical ventilation
- Post-procedural CXR to evaluate for evidence of barotrauma as a consequence of positive pressure ventilation
- Long-term analgesia and sedation

# Tracheostomy

I. Overview

1. General features
   - Airway access for mechanical ventilation can be provided by either endotracheal (ET) or tracheostomy tube

2. Cuffed VS Cuffless tracheostomy
   [Image of two tracheostomy tubes, one with an inflated cuff and the other with a deflated cuff. The tube with the inflated cuff has a balloon-like structure visible around the shaft of the tube. Below each image is a text label; under the left tracheostomy tube with the inflated cuff, the label reads "Cuff inflated"; under the right tracheostomy tube with the deflated cuff, the label reads "Cuff deflated."]

- Cuffed tracheostomy
  - Indicated in patients requiring mechanical ventilation to direct the flow of air
    - Seal off the airway so that all of the air delivered from the ventilator goes in and out of the lung in one direction without leaking through nose and mouth
  - Inflated cuff can protect lower airway from aspiration (controversial)
    - Inflated cuff can minimize extent of aspirated material or secretions such as saliva from passing down into the lungs
    - Aspirated material sitting above the cuff should be removed regularly via tubes with an above the cuff suction port or by suctioning
    - Prolonged pooling of secretions will lead to seepage of material below cuff thus defeating the purpose of minimizing aspiration
    - Some argue that the inflated cuff does not form a complete seal and material will leak around into lower airway
  - Misconception
    - Cuff is **NOT** inflated for the purpose of anchoring the tracheostomy
  - Limitations
    - Patient is **UNABLE** to speak when cuff is inflated since during expiration air cannot pass up to the vocal cord to produce sound
    - Prolonged inflation of cuff can lead to pressure necrosis and impingement of esophagus leading to swallowing difficulty
- Non-cuffed tracheostomy
  - Indicated in patients that are reading for decannulation (weaning of tracheostomy) and **NOT** requiring mechanical ventilation

3. Fenestrated **VS** Non-fenestrated tracheostomy

[Diagram of a fenestrated tracheostomy tube inserted into a patient's trachea. The diagram shows the path of air through the tube and the fenestrations. The fenestrations are openings in the tube that allow air to pass through the vocal cords, enabling speech.]

➡Fenestrated tracheostomy

- Allows air to reach the vocal cord during expiration and hence patient is able to speak
- Indicated when a speaking valve is intolerated

4. Adjuncts to tracheostomy

[Image of a purple Passy Muir Valve. It is a one-way valve that attaches to the end of a tracheostomy tube. The valve allows air to enter the lungs through the tracheostomy tube but forces exhaled air to pass over the vocal cords, enabling speech.]

➡Passey Muir speaking valve

- One-way valve that is placed on the end of tracheostomy tube for patients who are capable for speech
- Allows air to breath in through the valve but will close when patient tries to breathe out
- Air will thus pass through the vocal cord up to nose and mouth and the patient will be able to speak
- The cuff **MUST** be deflated otherwise the patient will not be able to exhale

5. Summary of different types of tracheostomy

| Types           | Cuffed                                                                            | Cuffless                                                                                 | Passey Muir valve |

II. Indications and contraindications

1. Indications
   ➡ Bypass upper airway obstruction

- Intrinsic obstruction such as foreign body or tumour
- Extrinsic obstruction such as wound hematoma or retrosternal goitre
- Anticipated obstruction after major H&N surgery with edema of surrounding structures
  ➡ Prolonged mechanical ventilation required
- Changing from ET tube to a tracheostomy tube is often considered when the need for mechanical ventilation is expected to be prolonged
  - For patients who are unable to wean from invasive ventilation within 1 - 3 weeks of intubation
- Tracheostomy offers the following advantage in prolonged ventilation
  - Improves patient comfort
  - Improves patient communication
  - Decreases need of sedation
  - Facilitate weaning off of ventilator (compared with ET tube which the process of reintubation is more traumatic in case of desaturation after removal of ventilator)
  - Avoid laryngeal injury due to prolonged intubation

2. Contraindications
   ➡ Relative contraindications

- Uncorrectable bleeding diathesis
- Gross distortion of neck from hematoma
- Scarring from previous neck surgery
- Suspected or documented tracheomalacia
- Infection of soft tissues in the neck
- Morbid obesity or short neck that obscures the landmarks

General surgery
Stoma principles
I. Overview

1. Definition
   ➡Ostomy is a purposeful anastomosis between segment of GIT and skin of anterior abdominal wall
   Functions of ostomy

- For **input**: Feeding purpose such as in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)
- For **output**: Decompression or defunctioning purpose

2. Principles of stoma placement
   ➡Easy visualization and accessibility

- Stoma usually lie on either side of abdominal midline just lateral or inferior to umbilicus
- Stoma placed higher on abdominal wall above umbilicus in obese patients - Make it more visible to patient and the abdominal wall is less thick
  ➡Overlays rectus abdominis muscle
- Provides additional support and stability of stoma
- ↓ Risk of stomal prolapse
  ➡Away from surgical incision
- ↓ Risk of wound contamination and infection
  ➡Away from previous surgical scars
- ↓ Risk of parastomal hernia
  ➡Away from skin creases and bony prominences
- Interferes with appliance adherence
- Prevents leakage of fluid leading to skin excoriation and infection

3. Ileostomy _VS_ Colostomy
   ➡ Ileostomy

- Performed when it is necessary to remove or bypass entire colon and rectum or to protect
  a distal colorectal, coloanal or ileoanal anastomosis
- Better for temporary fecal diversion
  ➡ Colostomy
- Performed when it is necessary to remove or bypass the distal colon, rectum or anus when
  it is not feasible to restore GI continuity
- Better for permanent fecal diversion

4. Temporary _VS_ Permanent
   ➡Temporary stoma

- Decompression purpose
  - Relief of bowel obstruction causing proximal dilatation
- Defunctioning purpose
  - Reduce rate of anastomotic leakage
- Resting of an inflamed distal portion - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
  ➡Permanent stoma
- _NO_ distal bowel remaining - Following APR for rectal cancer - Following panproctocolectomy without ileal pouch anastomosis
  64

5. Different types of ileostomy

[Image Description: The image contains three anatomical diagrams illustrating a diverting loop ileostomy. The first diagram shows a cross-section of the loop extending out, with a thin surgical tool splitting it open. The second diagram depicts a loop extended outwards, partially opened with one side still attached, and the third diagram shows the loop fully separated into two protruding parts connected to the body through sutures around the skin. All diagrams are anatomically detailed and show the tissue and sutures clearly.]

**Diverting loop ileostomy**

- Loop of terminal ileum is brought out through abdominal wall
- Loop of ileum is opened and sutured to dermis and stabilized with a rod or bridge until the bowel granulates to abdominal wall
- Everting proximal afferent end created with Brooke's technique
  - Allow effluent to come through the proximal sprout into the collecting bag system and prevent leakage onto surrounding skin
- Flush distal efferent end
  - Allow venting which minimize the potential for perforation of distal colon or rectum in the setting of obstruction

[Image Description: The image presents three anatomical diagrams demonstrating an end ileostomy. The first diagram shows a tubular structure, representing the ileum, extending out of the body, held in place by sutures. The second diagram shows the end of the ileum folded over and sutured to the skin, creating a protruding opening. The third diagram shows a matured end ileostomy with sutures connecting the ileum to the skin.]

**End ileostomy**

- Brooke's technique
  - Protrudes 2-3 cm above skin level which promotes drainage of effluent into the pouch and allows secure application of stoma appliance
  - Reduces skin irritation by minimizing spillage of enzymatic effluent beneath the pouching system and prevents development of serositis and potential stricture

65

6. Different types of colostomy

[Image of an end colostomy, showing a single, round stoma on the abdomen.]

**End colostomy** [Image of a loop colostomy, showing two adjacent stomas connected by a loop of bowel on the abdomen.] **Loop colostomy** [Image of a double-barrel stoma, showing two distinct stomas on the abdomen.] **Double-barrel stoma**

➡ Loop colostomy

- Transverse loop colostomy
  - Loop of transverse colon is brought out through abdominal wall
  - Loop of colon is opened and sutured to dermis and stabilized with a rod or bridge until the bowel granulates to abdominal wall
- Sigmoid loop colostomy
  - Similar to transverse loop colostomy and is useful for patients with a redundant sigmoid colon and an obstructive rectal or anal cancer

➡ End colostomy

- Everting proximal afferent end
  - Allow effluent to come through the proximal sprout into the collecting bag system and prevent leakage onto surrounding skin
- Flush distal efferent end
  - Allow venting which minimize the potential for perforation of distal colon or rectum in the setting of obstruction

➡ Double-barrel stoma

- Created by transecting bowel and bringing each end up to abdominal wall as separate stoma usually adjacent to one another
  - Proximal end functional colostomy
  - Distal mucous fistula
- Creation of mucous fistula by securing the distal end in the subcutaneous tissue but not matured out to skin
  - Indicated when there is high likelihood of breakdown of defunctionalized stump which can lead to abdominal sepsis

66

7. Indications

| Loop | Ileostomy | Colostomy | Temporary |
| ---- | --------- | --------- | --------- |

| ➡ Decompression of an obstructed or perforated distal colon  
➡ Defunctioning to protect distal colorectal or coloanal anastomosis following a sphincter-sparing procedure

- **Preferred** over colostomy due to relative ease of reversal compared with loop colostomy
- Reserved for patients with high-risk of anastomotic leakage | ➡ Decompression of an obstructed or perforated distal colon  
  ➡ Defunctioning to protect distal colorectal or coloanal anastomosis following a sphincter-sparing procedure
- _BUT_ diverting loop ileostomy is still the preferred for this purpose
- Reserved for patients with high-risk of anastomotic leakage  
  ➡ Facilitate healing of acute inflammatory process distal to colostomy  
  ➡ Fecal diversion proximal to fistula tract or unresectable distal malignancy |
  End | ➡Indicated when entire colon and rectum plus the anorectal sphincter mechanism are removed | ➡Creation of end colostomy and rectal stump  
  ➡Reserved for patients when primary anastomosis is contraindicated due to excessive contamination or inflammation of surrounding tissues increasing risk of anastomotic leakage  
  ➡Commonly performed in Hinchey Stage III or IV complicated diverticulitis or after LAR in rectal cancer  
  ➡Indicated when permanent fecal diversion is required
- **Preferred** over ileostomy due to decreased risk of dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities
- Performed in APR for rectal cancer or total abdominal proctocolectomy in severe IBD | Permanent

III. Complication and management

1. Complications of stoma
   ➡ Complication rate

- **Highest** complication rate for loop ileostomy
- **Lower** complication rate for end-ileostomy and end-colostomy

| Group                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Early (within 3 months) | ➡Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance - Common in ileostomy due to high-output effluent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                         | ➡ Bleeding - Major bleeding occurs from either a stomal laceration from a poorly fitting appliance or presence of peristomal varices in patient with portal hypertension - Minor bleeding occurs from creation of stoma or with overly vigorous stomal cleansing                                                                                            |
|                         | ➡Stomal necrosis - Occurs as a result of arterial insufficiency or venous congestion o Tight fascial opening and excessive mesenteric stripping - Prevented by adequate mobilization of bowel, preservation of blood supply to stoma and adequate trephine size                                                                                             |
|                         | ➡Stomal retraction - Defined as stoma that is 0.5 cm or more below the skin surface within 6 weeks of construction - Caused by tension on the stoma - Most common risk factor is obesity due to thickness of abdominal wall and foreshortened mesentery - Lead to leakage and difficulties with pouch adherence and subsequently peristomal skin irritation |
|                         | ➡ Mucocutaneous separation - Separation of ostomy from peristomal skin - Lead to leakage and peristomal skin irritation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                         | ➡Small bowel obstruction - Result of fecal impaction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Late                    | ➡Parastomal hernia - Common complication especially among colostomy patient - Risk factors include obesity, chronic cough, poor abdominal muscle tone, placement of stoma outside of rectus muscle and large fascial opening - Majority are asymptomatic and do not progress to complication such as bowel obstruction, incarceration and strangulation     |
|                         | ➡Stomal prolapse - Common in loop ostomy particularly those constructed using the transverse colon - Telescoping of intestine out from the stoma which make appliance placement and adherence difficult - Prolonged prolapse causes intestinal edema or even incarceration and strangulation                                                                |
|                         | ➡Stomal stenosis - Narrowing of stoma sufficient to interfere with normal function - Early stenosis can be due to edema at the fascial level or due to scarring or tightness of mucocutaneous junction                                                                                                                                                      |
|                         | ➡Dermatitis (Peristomal skin irritation) - **MOST** common complication encountered - Common in ileostomy due to high alkaline enzymatic effluent - Characterized by denuded skin along inferior aspect of stoma                                                                                                                                            |

2. Routine care for stoma
   ➡ Ileostomy
   • Adequate daily fluid intake
   Ο Ileostomy effluent contains significant amount of Na+ and K+
   Ο Decreased absorption of certain vitamin, mineral and electrolytes may lead to electrolyte imbalance
   • Avoid consumption of large amount of insoluble fibers
   Ο Common offenders include popcorns, coconut, mushrooms, black olives, food with skins, dried fruits and meat with casings
   Ο Prevent food blockage proximal to ostomy site
   • Avoid laxatives and time-released or enteric-coated medications
   Ο Laxatives may lead to acute dehydration
   Ο Time-released or enteric-coated medication are likely to be incompletely absorbed
   ➡ Colostomy
   • **NO** absolute dietary restriction but ingestion of sufficient fiber and fluid is encouraged to prevent constipation
   • Colon irrigation
   Ο Indicated for patients with constipation but is appropriate only for patients with distal colostomy and is not effective for all patients
   Ο Instillation of water into descending or sigmoid colon ostomy on a routine schedule and the resulting bowel distention stimulates peristaltic activity which causes the colon to empty

IV. Commonly asked questions
Q: What are the risk factors for increased anastomotic leakage?
➡ Immunosuppressants which impairs wound healing
• Corticosteroids
➡ Malnourishment
➡ Previous irradiation of pelvis
➡ Low colorectal anastomosis
• < 5 - 7 cm from anal verge

# Urinary catheterization

I. Overview

1. General features
   - Bladder catheters are used for urinary drainage or as a means to collect urine for measurement
   - Daily evaluation of ongoing need for catheter is essential to reduce complications

2. Choice of catheter
   - Indwelling catheter
     - Preferred for short-term bladder drainage < 3 weeks
   - Intermittent catheter
     - Removal of catheter immediately after bladder decompression with recatheterization on a scheduled basis
     - Should be performed at regular intervals to prevent bladder overdistension
     - **Advantages**
       - Reduced complication rate
   - Suprapubic catheter
     - Preferred for long-term bladder drainage
     - Most invasive procedure which is placed either percutaneously or intraoperatively
     - Indicated in patient who have contraindications or failed urethral catheterization
     - **Advantages**
       - Prevents urethral trauma and stricture or periurethral abscess formation
       - Prevent urinary sphincter dysfunction leading to incontinence
       - Reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI)
       - Allow assessment of patient's ability to void before removing the catheter and thus prevent the need of recatheterization

3. Types of catheter
   - Size of catheter
     - Males = 14 – 18 Fr
     - Females = 12 – 16 Fr
   - Material of catheter
     - Latex = Short-term use (**max** = 2 weeks) - Yellow tube
     - Silicon = Long-term use (**max** = 4 weeks) - Transparent
   - Number of ports
     - Standard catheter is 2-way
       - One port for urine drainage and another for balloon inflation
     - Triple-lumen catheters (3-way)
       - Additional irrigation channels for hematuria patient
       - Used for bladder irrigation by instillation of fluid into bladder through the irrigation port and drained through the catheter
       - Indicated in patients with hematuria with clot formation which can lead to AROU or in patients required pharmacological therapy

II. **Indications and contraindications**

1. Indications
   ➡Acute or chronic urinary retention

- With or without bladder outlet obstruction (BOO)
  ➡Neurogenic bladder
- Bladder dysfunction from spinal cord injury (SCI)
  ➡Prolonged immobilization
  ➡Hourly urine output measurement (Q1H) in critically ill patients
  ➡Daily urine output measurement for fluid management or diagnostic test
  ➡Intraoperative monitoring
- Prolonged duration of surgery
- Require large-volume infusion or diuretics

2. Contraindications to urethral catheterization
   ➡**Absolute** contraindication

- Urethral injury - Typically associated with pelvic trauma
  ➡**Relative** contraindication
- Urethral stricture
- Recent urinary tract surgery
  - Radical prostatectomy
  - Urethral reconstruction
  - Presence of artificial sphincter

3. Contraindications to suprapubic catheterization
   ➡Non-distended bladder
   ➡Uncorrected bleeding tendency
   ➡Known or suspected urothelial cancer
   [Image of the number 72 at the bottom right of the page]

### III. Procedures

1. Technique of transurethral catheter placement
   ➡ Patient is placed in supine position - Females are placed in frog-legged to maximize exposure of periurethral region
   ➡ Periurethral region is cleansed with antiseptic such as chlorhexidine and aqueous hibitane - Males: Penis is grasped with non-dominant hand and tension directed towards the ceiling to straighten the urethra - Females: Labia is spread with non-dominant hand to facilitate cleansing of periurethral region and view of urethral meatus
   ➡ Insertion of urinary catheter - Local anaesthetic such as lidocaine can be applied - Dominant hand place the catheter into urethral meatus and steady gentle pressure is used to advance the catheter - Withdraw the Foley catheter in case resistance is felt to prevent creation of false tract
   ➡ Balloon is inflated with 10 mL of sterile water only after the flow of urine is seen - Compress the bladder or use bladder syringe to aspirate or instill water if no urine can be seen + Confirmation with bladder USG - Saline should **NOT** be used for inflation since crystal formation may obstruct the balloon channel and prevent balloon deflation - Catheter is withdrawn once balloon is inflated until slight resistance is felt
   ➡ Urine collection system is connected and the drainage tubing is anchored to the leg with tape to prevent traction of catheter on urethral meatus

[Image of a page footer with the number 73 on the bottom right]

2. Technique of suprapubic catheter placement

[Illustration depicting the technique of suprapubic catheter placement. It shows two diagrams, one labeled "Direct puncture technique" and the other "Seldinger technique." Both illustrate the process of inserting a catheter into the bladder through the abdominal wall. The direct puncture technique shows a catheter-trocar being inserted directly into the bladder. The Seldinger technique shows a needle being inserted, followed by a guidewire, a catheter, and finally a sheath.]

➡ USG is used to verify full bladder distension prior to the procedure
➡ Lower abdominal skin is prepared and local anesthetic is injected

- LA such as lidocaine is injected in midline 2 cm above the pubic symphysis
  ➡Catheter is placed through a small skin incision into bladder through direct puncture technique or Seldinger technique
- Direct puncture technique
  - Mushroom catheter is straightened with a stylet and advanced into bladder
  - Stylet is removed once the catheter is confirmed within the bladder
- Seldinger technique - Needle is inserted until urine is aspirated - Guidewire is placed through the needle into bladder and the needle is removed - Dilator is advanced over the wire enlarging the tract - Dilator is the replaced with a sheath and the guidewire is removed - Catheter placed through the sheath which is the peeled away
  ➡Cather balloon is inflated with sterile water and the catheter is gently withdrawn until slight tension is felt
  ➡Catheter is then connected to the catheter drainage system and secured to the patient

   - Antiplatelet and anticoagulates modifications should be modified by balancing the risk between bleeding from procedure and thromboembolic event that occurs when antithrombotic medications are interrupted
   - NSAIDS and aspirin can be continued safely
     ➡ Antibiotic prophylaxis
   - **NOT** recommended since the risk of infection related to routine diagnostic or therapeutic esophagogastroduodenoscopy
   - Recommended in patients undergoing endoscopy for variceal bleeding or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement

3. Dietary modifications
   ➡ **NO** food by mouth for 4 – 8 hours prior to procedure
   ➡ **NO** liquids for 2 hours prior to procedure

IV. Procedures

1. Technique of OGD
   ➡Position: Left lateral with their neck flexed forward

- Allow better visualization of the lesser curvature which is the often site of pathology
  ➡Sedatives such as midazolam are administered to patients
  ➡Topical local anesthesia such as lidocaine is administered to prevent gag reflex
  ➡Intubation with endoscope
- Upper endoscope is introduced into the mouth
- Visualization of epiglottis, vocal cords, piriform fossa and arytenoid cartilage
- Endoscope is passed posteriorly towards the upper esophageal sphincter - Ask the patient to swallow and the endoscope will enter the esophagus
  ➡Examination of esophagus and esophagogastric junction (EGJ)
- Elements to note include color of mucosa and evidence of erythema, erosions, ulcers, strictures, rings, webs, varices or diverticula
- Esophagogastric junction (EGJ) - Squamo-columnar junction where the squamous epithelial lining (pale pink) of esophagus meets the columnar lining of stomach (salmon-colored) - Corresponds with the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in which LES is **NOT** an anatomical sphincter but physiological
  ➡Examination of the stomach
- Particular attention should be paid to the area of angularis along the lesser curvature since it is the often site of pathology
- Retroflexion is required to allow adequate visualization of the proximal stomach and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) - Hiatus hernia is better visualized in this position
  ➡Pyloric intubation
- Pylorus is traversed under direct visualization
- Opening of pylorus sometimes require air insufflation
  ➡Examination of duodenum
- Duodenum has distinctive circular rings called valvulae conniventes
- Ampulla of Vater may be seen in the second portion of duodenum

2. Diagnostic and therapeutic maneuver
   ➡Endoscopic hemostasis
   ➡Biopsy or brushings

- Painless since the colonic mucosa lacks pain receptors
  ➡Polypectomy
- Small polyps can be removed with biopsy forceps
- Large polyps require snare resection with or without electrocautery
  ➡Foreign body removal
- Dilatation of esophageal, gastric outlet, anastomotic stricture
  ➡Stent placement of benign or malignant disease
  ➡Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of gastrointestinal tumour

III. # Preoperative preparations

1. # Consent and instructions
   ➡ Informed consent should include

- Nature of the procedure
- Benefits
- Risks
- Alternatives
- Limitation of procedure

2. # Medications
   ➡ Majority of medications can be continued up to the time of colonoscopy
   ➡ Adjustment of medications is indicated for

- DM medications modifications due to decreased oral intake prior to procedures
- Iron supplement need to be stopped 3 - 4 days before colonoscopy since it will make the residual feces black, viscous and difficult to purge
- Antiplatelet and anticoagulates modifications should be modified by balancing the risk between bleeding from procedure and thromboembolic event that occurs when antithrombotic medications are interrupted
- NSAIDS and aspirin can be continued safely
  ➡ Antibiotic prophylaxis is **NOT** recommended since the risk of infection related to routine diagnostic or therapeutic colonoscopy

3. # Dietary modifications
   ➡ Adequate oral hydration

- Better preparation and fewer adverse events including nausea related to preparation
  ➡ Low-residue diet 3 days prior to colonoscopy
- Avoid food that are high in fibers such as fruits, vegetables or whole grains
  ➡ Clear liquids only on the day when performing colonoscopy
- Clear liquids includes water, clear broth, coffee or tea without milk, gelatin, fruit juices
- **NO** food by mouth for 4 - 8 hours prior to procedure
- **NO** liquids for 2 hours prior to procedure

82

4. Bowel preparation
   ➡Significance of bowel preparation

- Permits visualization of entire colonic mucosa
- Increases safety of therapeutic maneuver
- ↓ Risk of missing lesions
- ↓ Risk of adverse events related to the procedures
- ↓ Insertion time and overall procedure time
- ↑ Intubation rate of cecum
  ➡Risk factors for inadequate preparation
- Patient-related
  - History of constipation
  - Medications associated with constipation (e.g. opioids/TCA)
  - Low health literacy or cognitive skills
  - Dementia
  - Parkinson's disease
- Procedure-related - Later colonoscopy starting time - Administration of entire preparation the night before colonoscopy rather than split-dosing
  ➡ Timing of preparation
- Morning colonoscopy
  - Split does is preferred meaning administration of half of the colon cleansing agent the evening prior to colonoscopy and the second half the morning of colonoscopy
  - Advantages include improved efficacy, polyp detection and patient tolerance
- Afternoon colonoscopy - Either single dose or split dose are acceptable options
  ➡ Dosing of preparation
- High-dose = 4 L (maximum)
- Low-dose = 2 L
  ➡ Preparations
- **Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 + Electrolytes (Klean Prep®)**
  - High molecular weight, non-absorbable polymer formulated as isotonic solution
  - Good cleansing efficacy with reasonable patient tolerance
  - NO net absorption or secretion of ions
  - NO fluid exchange across colonic membrane due to isotonicity
  - NO damage to colonic mucosa

# IV. Procedures

1. Technique of colonoscopy

[Image Description: Two diagrams illustrate different looping configurations during colonoscopy. The first diagram on the left shows a "Gamma loop," where the colonoscope forms a shape resembling the Greek letter gamma, with a sharp curve. The second diagram on the right depicts an "Alpha loop," in which the colonoscope forms a shape resembling the Greek letter alpha, creating a more open curve.]

**Gamma loop** **Alpha loop**
Looping during colonoscopy
➡ **Position:** Left lateral decubitus
➡ Sedatives such as midazolam are administered to patients
➡ Lubricating gel is applied on colonoscope
➡ Tip is inserted into rectum with air inflation and suctioning of residual fluid

- Air or CO2 can be used for air insufflation
- Air insufflation using CO2 instead of air may reduce distension and patient discomfort
  ➡ Advancement of endoscopy to intubate the cecum
- Looping occurs since sigmoid and transverse colon is attached to a mobile mesentery
- Repeated loop reduction is required and requires pulling back colonoscope while applying torque
- Applying abdominal pressure and changing patient's position are important adjunctive technique to enable passage of colonoscope to cecum
  ➡ Advancement of endoscope until reaching the ileocecal valve ± terminal ileum
- Terminal ileum is intubated when inflammatory bowel disease (especially Crohn's disease) or ileitis are suspected

2. Important landmarks of colonoscopy

[Image Description: Three endoscopic images depict different landmarks in the colon. The first image, labeled "Terminal ileum," shows the inside of the terminal ileum with numerous small, finger-like projections called villi. The second image, labeled "Cecum," shows the cecum with an arrow pointing to the "Appendiceal orifice". The third image, labeled "Ileocecal valve," shows the ileocecal valve.]

**Numerous villi** **Appendiceal orifice**
**Terminal ileum** **Cecum** **Ileocecal valve**
➡ Hepatic and splenic flexure

- Identified by the bluish hue of adjacent organs which are the liver and spleen respectively visualized through the colonic mucosa

4. Reporting of colonoscopy findings
   ➡ Location from anal verge
   ➡ Length of lesion
   ➡ Circumferential involvement
   ➡ Presence of contact bleeding
   ➡ Complete or incomplete colonoscopy

[Image Description: The image is a page from a document, likely a medical guide or study material. It contains two numbered sections, 3 and 4, each detailing specific aspects of a medical procedure. Section 3 lists various diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers, including endoscopic hemostasis, biopsy, polypectomy (further detailing small and large polyps removal methods), dilatation of colonic stricture, stent placement, EMR/ESD, foreign body removal, and tube placements. Section 4 outlines the reporting of colonoscopy findings, covering location, lesion length, circumferential involvement, presence of bleeding, and completion status. The page also includes the number 85 at the bottom.]

# Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ ERCP is an endoscopic technique in which a specialized side-viewing upper endoscope is guided into duodenum allowing instruments to be passed into bile and pancreatic ducts
   ➡ Structures are opacified by injection of contrast permitting radiologic visualization and therapeutic interventions

- ERCP has evolved into a predominantly therapeutic procedures

II. Indications and contraindications

1. Indications
   ➡ Symptom-based

- Jaundice (suspected having biliary obstruction)
- Deranged LFT
  ➡ Disease-based
- Pancreatic diseases
  Ο Biliary pancreatitis
  Ο Chronic/ Recurrent pancreatitis
  Ο Pancreatic pseudocysts
  Ο Pancreatic cancer
- Bile duct diseases
  Ο Choledocholithiasis
  Ο Cholangiocarcinoma
  Ο CA Ampulla of Vater
  Ο Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD)
- Gallbladder diseases

2. Contraindications
   ➡ Unstable cardiopulmonary disease
   ➡ Known or suspected perforation
   ➡ Structural upper GI abnormalities

- Esophageal diverticulum
- Esophageal stricture
- Paraesophageal hiatus hernia
- Gastric volvulus
- Gastric outlet obstruction
  ➡ Gastric surgery
- Partial gastrectomy with
  Ο Billroth type II anastomosis
  Ο Rou-en-Y jejunojejunostomy

III. **Preoperative preparations**

1. Consent and instructions
   ➡ Informed consent should include

- Nature of the procedure
- Benefits
- Risks
- Alternatives
- Limitation of procedure

IV. **Procedures**

1. Technique of ERCP
   ➡ Position: Prone (standard)/ Supine

- Prone position
  - Lower risk of aspiration
  - Easier endoscopic and airway access
  - Favourable orientation for X-ray to pass through in vertical fluoroscopy setup which gives good AP imaging
  - Easier image interpretation of anatomy due to reduced radiation scatter (AP diameter of patient < Transverse diameter of patient)
- Supine position
  - Indicated in patients with abdominal distension or tenderness due to tense ascites, morbid obesity, advanced pregnancy, recent abdominal surgery or indwelling percutaneous catheter

2. Diagnostic and therapeutic maneuver
   ➡ Endoscopic hemostasis
   ➡ Biopsy or brushings

- Tissue sampling from pancreatic or bile ducts
  ➡ Sphincterotomy
- Choledocholithiasis
- Choledochocele involving major papilla
- Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD)
- CA Ampulla of Vater who are not candidates for surgery
- Dilation of biliary stricture
- Facilitate biliary stent placement
- Facilitate cholangioscopy or pancreatoscopy
  ➡ Balloon dilation of papilla
  ➡ Stone extraction
  ➡ Placement of stent
- Form of internal drainage
- Across benign or malignant strictures, fistula or postoperative bile leak
  ➡ Placement of nasobiliary drain
- Form of external drainage

I. Overview

1. Definition
   - ➡Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage
     - Emphasizes both physical and emotional nature of pain
     - Multidimensional with sensory, physiological, cognitive, affective, behavioral and spiritual components
2. Classification of pain

Pathophysiology ➡Nociceptive pain

- Arises when tissue injury activates specific pain receptors called
  nociceptors which are sensitive to noxious stimuli
- Subdivided into somatic and visceral pain depending on the location of
  activated receptors
- Character of pain is described as
  - Aching/Throbbing/ Tightness/ Squeezing
- More opioids responsive
- Somatic pain
  - Activation of nociceptors in either surface tissues (skin, mucosa)
    or deep tissues (bone, joint, muscle, connective tissue)
  - Precise localization of pain
- Visceral pain - Activation of nociceptors in the viscera (internal organs) - Caused by infection, distention from fluid or gas, stretching or
  compression - Poor localization of pain and mostly perceived in midline due to
  bilateral symmetrical innervation - Referred to skin supplied from same sensory roots that supply the
  diseased organ
  ➡Neuropathic pain
- Structural damage and nerve cell dysfunction in CNS or PNS
- Poor localization of pain perceived within the innervation territory of the
  damaged nerve
- Character of pain is described as - Tingling/Pricking/ Needle-like/Numbness/ Electric-like/
  Burning
- Less opioids responsive
- Respond to antidepressant and anticonvulsants
  - SSRIs: Fluoxetine
  - TCA: Amitriptyline/ Nortriptyline
  - Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine/ Gabapentin/ Pregabalin
- CNS neuropathic pain
  - Lesion in brain or spinal cord
  - Example: Spinal cord injury
- PNS neuropathic pain - Lesion in peripheral nerves, dorsal root and dorsal root ganglion - Example: Nerve injury/ Nerve compression or entrapment/
  Nerve damage/ Nerve tumour/ Nerve infiltration
- Sensory features suggestive of neuropathic pain - Allodynia = Pain due to a stimulus that normally does not
  provoke pain - Hyperalgesia = ↑ Pain response to normally painful stimulus - Hypoalgesia = ↓ Pain response to normally painful stimulus - Paraesthesia = Abnormal sensation to a stimulus such as
  tingling, pricking, needle-like or numbness - Dysesthesia = Unpleasant sensation - Hyperesthesia = ↑ Sensitivity to stimulation - Hypoesthesia = ↓Sensitivity to stimulation

II. History taking

1. Assessment of pain
   ➡Site

- Well-localized or poorly localized
  ➡Onset
- Onset of pain and whether it is sudden and gradual
  ➡Character
- **Nociceptive pain**: Aching/ Throbbing/ Tightness/ Squeezing
- **Neuropathic pain**: Tingling/ Pricking/ Needle-like/ Numbness/ Electric-like/ Burning
  ➡ Radiation
  ➡Associated symptoms
  ➡Time course
- **Acute pain**: < 30 days
- **Chronic pain**: > 3 months
- Intermittent/ Episodic/ Recurrent/Continuous/ Progressive
  ➡Exacerbating factors
  ➡Relieving factors
  ➡ Severity
- Pain awakening from sleep
- Pain restricting normal daily activities
- Pain affecting emotional states
- Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)
  - Verbally ask the patient to estimate her pain level on a 0 – 10 pain scale
  - 0 = represents no pain
  - 10 = represents the worst pain
- Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)

[Image Description: A visual analogue scale is shown. It is labeled "Place a vertical mark on the line below to indicate how bad you feel your pain is today". Below this is a horizontal line. The left side of the line is labeled "No pain". The right side is labeled "Worst pain imaginable". Below the line is "OR". Below this is a rounded box with the text "What does your pain feel like?". The bottom section has a horizontal scale from 0 to 10. Underneath the 0 is "None". Underneath 1-3 is "Mild". Underneath 4-6 is "Moderate". Underneath 7-9 is "Very bad". Underneath 10 is "Unbearable".]

2. Assessment of pain relief
   ➡Compliance of analgesics
   ➡Satisfactory pain control level

- Patient can sleep well
- Changes in pain intensity scale to pain score 0–3
- Need of prn analgesics for breakthrough pain 0–2 times per day
  92

III. Pain control

1. WHO principles of pain management
   ➡ By the ladder (3-step ladder)

- WHO analgesic ladder

| Ladder |                        | Choice of treatment                   |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Step 1 | Mild pain              | Non-opioid + Adjuvant                 | ➡ Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) ⇨ NSAIDs |
| Step 2 | Mild – Moderate pain   | Weak opioid + Non-opioid + Adjuvant   | ➡ Codeine ➡ Tramadol                   |
| Step 3 | Moderate – Severe pain | Strong opioid + Non-opioid + Adjuvant | ⇨ Morphine ➡ Fentanyl                  |

- Adjuncts for analgesia - Laxatives to treat constipation - Antiemetics to treat nausea and vomiting - Sedatives to treat insomnia - Anxiolytic to treat anxiety - Anti-depressants to treat depression - Corticosteroids to enhance pain relief
  ➡ By the clock
- Medications should be administered at regular intervals rather than on an "as required" basis unless pain episodes are truly intermittent and unpredictable
- Next dose should be given before the effect of the previous dose has fully worn off in order to relieve pain continuously
- Addition of rescue dose (50 – 100% of regular dose) is required for intermittent and breakthrough pain
  ➡ By the mouth
- Using the appropriate route of administration
- Oral route (PO) is the most convenient and least expensive route of administration
  ➡ By the individual
- Adapting treatment to the individual patient
- Analgesics should be titrated on individual basis based on patient's reaction to medicine
  ➡ Attention to detail
- Determine what the patient know, believes or fear about the pain
- Give precise instructions for taking the medications
- Patient should be warned about possible adverse effects

93

2. Non-opioid analgesics
   ➡ Paracetamol (Acetaminophen)

- Mechanism of action
  - Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor
  - Inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins in CNS

| Drugs       | ROA   | Dosage         | Maximum dose |
| ----------- | ----- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Paracetamol | PO/IV | 500 mg Q4 – 6H | < 4 g/day    |

- Adverse effects
  - GI bleeding
  - Hepatotoxicity (Acute liver failure)
    ➡ NSAIDS
- More effective treatment than acetaminophen in pain relief
- Mechanism of action
  - Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor
  - Inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins in CNS
- Side effects
  - Rash and hypersensitivity
  - Risk of **CVS** diseases (e.g. MI/ Stroke/ CHF)
    - (Na+ retention will exacerbate congestive heart failure)
  - Bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm
    - (↑ Production of leukotrienes which are potent bronchoconstrictors due to metabolism using lipoxygenase pathway after blockage of cyclooxygenase pathway)
  - GI bleeding and abdominal pain
    - (↓ PGE2 produced from COX-1 protect gastric mucosal lining from injury)
  - Impaired renal, hepatic function
    - (↓ Renal prostaglandins synthesis for vasodilation which thus decreases renal blood flow and thus renal failure with Na+ retention/ Minimal change disease/ Membranous nephropathy/ Tubulointerstitial nephritis )
  - Inhibits platelet aggregation increasing bleeding tendency
    - (↓ TXA2 produced from COX-1 by platelets)
  - Example: Ibuprofen/ Naproxen/ Diclofenac
    ➡ COX-2 inhibitors
- Mechanism of action
  - Selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor
  - Inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins in CNS
- Benefits over NSAIDS
  - Reduced risk of GI toxicity (e.g. peptic ulcers)
  - Lack of bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm
  - Lack of effect on platelets and reduced risk of bleeding in anticoagulated patients
- Side effects
  - Acute renal failure
  - Higher risk of CVS diseases than non-selective NSAIDs (e.g. MI/ Stroke)
    - (Platelet expresses COX-1 receptor only to produce TXA2 which is prothrombotic; Endothelial cells express both COX-1 and 2 receptors to produce PGI2 which inhibits platelet aggregation; Selective COX-2 inhibitor decreases PGI2 production with little or no inhibition of TXA2 production which predisposes to thrombosis)
  - Example: Celecoxib/ Etoricoxib/ Lumiracoxib/ Rofecoxib/ Valdecoxib

94

3. Opioid analgesics
   ➡General features

- Acts by binding to µ-receptors, k-receptors or 8-receptors
- Route of administration
  - Oral/ IV/ IM/ SC/ Transdermal/ Epidural/ Spinal/ PCA

➡Classification of opioids

- Morphine is the most commonly used opioid
- Fentanyl can substitute morphine in patients with renal failure

| Types      | Example                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Weak       | ➡ Codeine <br> ➡ Tramadol                                                                                                             |
| **Strong** | ➡ Morphine (_most common_) <br> ➡ Fentanyl/ Alfentanil/ Remifentanil <br> ➡ Pethidine <br> ➡ Oxycodone <br> ➡ Methadone <br> ⇨ Heroin |

➡Recommended dosage

| Drugs    | ROA            | Dosage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Maximum dose                                              |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tramadol | PO/ IM/ IV     | 50 – 100 mg TDS/QID                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Elderly: < 300 mg/day <br> Renal impairment: < 200 mg/day |

  - Secondary to histamine release in opioids like morphine
  - Prescribe anti-histamine whenever necessary
- Constipation
  - Always prescribe laxatives with opioids
  - Senna (Senokot) 2 tablets nocte PO
  - Lactulose 10 mL BD-TDS PO

# General anesthesia

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Anesthesia refers to the provision of a combination of amnesia, analgesia and muscle
   relaxation to allow performance of surgery or interventional procedures
   ➡ Physiological homeostasis is critical which includes monitoring and treatment of cardiovascular,
   pulmonary, neurologic and renal functions and changes during the perioperative period
2. Goals of anesthesia
   ➡ Amnesia

- Refers to a lack of memory of intraoperative and perioperative experience
- Reliably achieved by inducing a state of unconsciousness by GA
- Risk of awareness with recall is higher in emergency surgery when a lighter depth of
  anesthesia is employed in potentially unstable patients in order to maintain BP and organ
  perfusion
  ➡ Analgesia
- Pain control is essential in perioperative management and is achieved through LA - Neuraxial anesthesia with epidural or spinal anesthetics - Peripheral nerve block - Parental narcotics or NSAIDs
  ➡ Muscle relaxation
- Neuromuscular blockade to ensure patient remains still during surgery
- Blockage of ACh receptors at NMJ of striated muscle to provide relaxation of major
  muscle groups in body
- Reversal is accomplished with anticholinesterase agent administered with an anti-
  muscarinic agent

3. Common anesthetic access and monitors
   ➡ Temperature probe
   ➡ Pulse oximeter
   ➡ Nasogastric (Ryle's) tube
   ➡ Foley's catheter

- Monitoring of urine output
  ➡ Endotracheal intubation
- Superior in terms of airway protection
- Tube is placed via mouth into trachea under direct visualization using laryngoscope
- Confirmation of ET tube position - Rise in bilateral chest wall with ventilation - Mist in ET tube with each exhalation - 5-point auscultation - End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) - Chest radiograph (CXR)
  ➡ Laryngeal mask airway (LMA)
- Supraglottic airway placement
- Easier placement than ET tube and can be used as rescue technique after failed intubation
  ➡ O2 analyzer
- Monitor inspired and expired gas O2 content
  ➡ Capnograph
- Monitor inspired and expired CO2 and EtCO2
  [Image Description: This is a page from a medical document, seemingly a study guide or set of notes, discussing general anesthesia. The document is organized into sections and subsections, discussing the overview, goals, and common anesthetic access and monitors used in general anesthesia. The text includes bulleted lists and arrow symbols to denote specific points and subcategories within each section. Headings and subheadings are clearly labeled to provide structure to the information. The page number "97" is at the bottom right corner.]

➡ Non-invasive BP monitoring (NIBP)

- Monitoring of arterial BP
  ➡Arterial catheter insertion (Arterial line)
- Placed in radial artery at the level of wrist
- Modified Allen's test
  - Assess collateral flow to the hand prior to procedure to identify risk for ischemic distal to the puncture site
  - Demonstrate collateral flow from ulnar artery through superficial palmar arch
  - Patient's hand is initially held high with the fist clenched
  - Both radial and ulnar arteries are compressed firmly by 2 thumbs which allows blood to drain from the hand
  - Hand is then lowered and the fist is opened and the palm will appear white
  - Pressure is released from ulnar artery maintaining occlusion on radial artery
  - **Normal:** Pink color should return to the palm within 6s
  - **Abnormal:** Pink color return to the palm ≥ 10s
- Indicated in patients requiring prolonged surgery or prone to BP fluctuations
- **Continuous + Real-time** arterial BP monitoring
- Frequent blood taking for acid-base and electrolyte analysis
  ➡ Peripheral IV catheter placement
- Large bore IV cannula = 14/ 16 Gauge
- Peripheral venous cannula for administration of medications, IV fluid and blood products
  ➡Central venous catheter placement
- Single/ Double/ Triple lumen catheter
- Normal CVP: < 8 mmHg
- Placement of catheter into internal or external jugular, subclavian or femoral vein
- Estimation of right atrial (RA) pressure and indicates the preload
- Monitoring volume status, infusion of medications too irritating for peripheral administration and even blood taking
  ➡Pulmonary artery catheterization
- Access through central venous circulation, RA, RV and into pulmonary artery
- Provides hemodynamic information including CO, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure
  ➡Electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Assess for rate and rhythm
  ➡Processed electroencephalography (EEG)
- Technology used is known as bispectral index (Bis)
- Monitor the depth of anesthesia in GA
- Monitor and prevent awareness with recall which is potentially a psychologically devastating complication

- **Propofol**: Induction agent of choice for most patients
  - Agonists on GABAA receptor complex (GABA (y-aminobutyric acid) is an
    inhibitory neurotransmitter of CNS)
  - Antagonist on NMDA receptor to reduce glutamate activity (Glutamate is an
    excitatory neurotransmitter of CNS)
- **Thiopental**: Fallen out of favour due to long t1/2
- **Etomidate**: Patients with hemodynamic instability due to any cause (most CVS stable)
  - Agonists on GABAA receptor complex (GABA (y-aminobutyric acid) is an
    inhibitory neurotransmitter of CNS)
- **Ketamine**: Patients who are hypotensive or likely to develop hypotension (e.g.
  hypovolemia, hemorrhage, sepsis, cardiovascular compromise) - Antagonist on NMDA receptor to reduce glutamate activity (Glutamate is an
  excitatory neurotransmitter of CNS) - Produce a state of dissociative anesthesia where dose-related anterograde amnesia
  and analgesia are achieved without hypnosis

➡ Duration of action of induction agents

- Induction agents will first distribute from blood to highly vascularized group such as
  brain, heart and kidneys - Rapid onset of anesthetic effect and put the patient into sleep as the agent crosses
  blood-brain barrier (BBB)
- Redistribution to less vascular regions including muscle, skin and fat compartment slowly
  - Patient will wake up as the concentration of agent in the effector site (i.e. brain)
    decreases (whether patient wake up depends on anesthetic concentration in brain)
  - Maintenance agent is therefore required

**Propofol**

**Advantages**

➡Rapid onset and recovery

- Short elimination t1/2
- Less prolonged sedation and wake-up time is manageable and predictable

➡Anti-emetic properties (Less PONV)

- Good choice for patients with increased risk of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV)

➡Anti-pruritic properties

- Good choice for patients who will receive opioid which often causes pruritus

➡Anti-convulsants properties

- Decreases cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption
- Leads to reduction in cerebral blood flow and ICP

➡Bronchodilation

- Decreases airway resistance and useful for induction in patients with asthma and bronchospasm

➡Suitable for hepatic or renal insufficiency

**Disadvantages**

➡Hypotension (dose-dependent)

- ↓ Contractility
- ↓ Preload by venodilation
- ↓ Afterload by arterial dilation

➡Respiratory depression

- ↓ Respiratory rate, tidal volume and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia

➡Pain on injection

- Causes venous irritation and is minimized by coadministration of lidocaine or opioid or injection into larger veins

Thiopental (old drugs) Fallen out of favor due to long elimination t1/2

**Etomidate**

➡Rapid onset and recovery

- Short elimination t1/2
- Less prolonged sedation

➡ **CVS (cardiovascular) stability**

- Does **NOT** cause vasodilation, myocardial depression or changes in heart rate

➡Anti-convulsants properties

- Decreases cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption
- Leads to reduction in cerebral blood flow and ICP

➡Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV)

- High incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting

➡Involuntary myoclonic movements

- Result of subcortical disinhibition

➡ **Transient acute adrenal insufficiency**

- Inhibits synthesis of cortisol

➡ **ABSENCE** of analgesic effects

- Does not blunt sympathetic stress response to noxious stimulation of upper airway during laryngoscopy and intubation

➡Pain on injection

- Causes venous irritation and is minimized by coadministration of lidocaine or opioid or injection into larger veins

Ketamine
➡Rapid onset and recovery

- Short elimination t1/2
- Less prolonged sedation
  ➡**Significant analgesia**
- Only induction agent that also has analgesic property
- Reduces post-operative opioid consumption
  ➡Preservation of respiratory drive
- Maintains airway reflexes and respiratory drive
- Useful when maintenance of spontaneous respiration is desirable
  ➡Bronchodilation
- Useful in patients with asthma and bronchospasm
  ➡Sympathomimetic effects
- Increases BP, HR and CO
- Detrimental in patients with ischemic heart disease due to imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand
- Detrimental in patients with hypertension due to further elevation of BP
- Detrimental in patients with right heart dysfunction or pulmonary HT due to increase in PAP
  ➡Psychomimetic effects
- Hallucinations, nightmares or delirium

⇒ Inhalation anesthetic agent

- Inhalation induction is indicated or preferred in the following situation
  - Infants or children who are resistant or irritative for IV access
  - IVDU in which IV access is difficult due to thrombosed veins
- Different types of inhalation anesthetic agents
  - Sevoflurane: MOST commonly used inhaled agent for induction
  - Desflurane: Most pungent and has the highest incidence of airway irritation
  - Isoflurane: Relatively pungent and has a slow onset and recovery (old drugs)
  - Halothane: Concern about hepatotoxicity and was banned in some countries but still used globally
- Comparison between blood and lipid solubility of agents

| Properties                                               | Sevoflurane | Desflurane | Isoflurane |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| **Blood : Gas partition coefficient** (Blood solubility) | 0.66        | 0.42       | 1.4        |
| **Oil : Gas partition coefficient** (Lipid solubility)   | 53.4        | 18.7       | 90.8       |
| **Minimum alveolar concentration** (MAC)                 | 2.05%       | 7%         | 1.15%      |
| Metabolism                                               | 5%          | 0.02%      | 0.2%       |

- Blood : Gas partition coefficient (blood solubility)
  - Low blood: gas partition coefficient (blood solubility)
  - Drug is less soluble in blood due to low blood solubility and is slowly absorbed into the bloodstream
  - ↓ Time to fill up the alveolar compartment
  - ↑ FA/FI (Alveolar concentration / Inhaled concentration)
  - Desflurane can build up a higher concentration in alveolar compartment more quickly
  - Desflurane has therefore a faster onset of action
- Oil : Gas partition coefficient (lipid solubility)
  - The higher the lipid solubility, the faster it crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
  - The higher the lipid solubility, the more anesthetic agents are distributed to fat tissues and slower elimination recovery
- Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)
  - Definition = Alveolar concentration of the inhaled agent which prevents movement in response to a surgical stimulation in 50% of subjects
  - Similar to minimum concentration to ensure effective anesthetic effect in 50% of patients
  - Dosage required is always higher than MAC

consumption
Advantages
➡**Rapid** onset and recovery

- Low tissue and blood solubility
  ➡Lack of pungency
  ➡**Rapid** onset and recovery (**FASTEST**)

# III. Maintenance

1. Choices of maintenance

- ➡Agents used in different options of maintenance
  - TIVA technique= Propofol + Opioids + Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA)
    - Propofol can be used as maintenance agent since it has a low contact sensitive half-life (t1/2) (contact insensitive) meaning the t1/2 will only increase slightly when given continuously
    - Continuous infusion of other agents (e.g. thiopental) will saturate the muscle and fat compartment and anesthetic will not be drawn away from brain rendering elimination possible through metabolism only and increasing t1/2 (contact sensitive)
  - Inhalation technique = Sevoflurane/ Desflurane/ Isoflurane + Opioids ± Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA)

2. Adjuncts for maintenance

- ⇨ Opioids
  - Analgesic component of TIVA technique
  - Benefits include effective analgesia, reduced requirement for other IV and inhalation anesthetic agents, attenuation of autonomic response to noxious stimuli and blunting of cough and gag reflex during airway manipulation
  - Example: Remifenanil\*/ Fentanyl/ Sufentanil/ Alfentanil/ Morphine
- ➡ Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) - Indicated if muscle relaxation in the surgical field or absence of movement are necessary which facilitate safety and technical performance

IV. **Emergence** (Restore of consciousness)

1. Overview
   ➡Discontinuation of anesthetics

- Timing of discontinuation should be individually planned for each IV or inhalation agent as the surgical procedure nears completion
  ➡Reverse effects of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA)
- Assess degree of muscle relaxation
  - Determined by using a peripheral nerve stimulator
  - Train-of-four (TOF) consists of 4 successive supramaximal stimuli delivered at 2 Hz no less than 10s apart
  - Progressive blockage leads to disappearance of the 4th twitch, followed by the 3rd, then the 2nd and finally the first
  - Dissipation of blockage leads to reappearance of twitches one by one
  - TOF ratio is calculated by dividing the amplitude of 4th response by the amplitude of 1st response
  - TOF count (TOFC) is defined as number of detectable evoked response and it correlates with the degree of neuromuscular block
  - TOF is assessed to determine whether ≥ 1 twitch is present indicating that neuromuscular blockade can be effectively reversed to prepare for emergence
- Administration of reversal agents - **Neostigmine** and **edrophonium** which are anti-cholinesterase to increase availability of ACh in NMJ ± **Atropine** to minimize ACh muscarinic side effects on parasympathetic nervous system (block vagal stimulation) - **Sugammadex** which inactivates steroidal NMBAs including rocuronium, vecuronium and pancuronium ONLY
  ➡Administration of analgesics
- Changes in BP, HR and RR during return of consciousness may suggest that analgesia may be inadequate and should be supplemented accordingly

# Regional anesthesia

I. Local anesthesia

1. Overview
   ➡Used to block transmission of impulses in nerve fibers to reduce or eliminate sensation
   ➡Can be used for neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks, subcutaneous and
   tissue infiltration and topical anesthesia

2. Pharmacodynamics
   ➡Efficacy VS Potency
   - Efficacy: Refers to the maximum therapeutic effect that a drug can produce regardless of
     dosage (more important)
   - Potency: Refers to amount of drug needed to produce a given effect - High potency drugs produce 100% therapeutic effect at a low concentration - Low potency drugs can still produce 100% therapeutic effect but at a much higher
     concentration - Potency of LA is primarily determined by lipid solubility as LAs are with greater
     solubility are able to permeate nerve membrane more readily
     ➡ Speed of onset
   - Depends on concentration
     - ↑ Concentration leads to faster onset
   - Depends on site of injection - Immediate onset with subcutaneous or tissue infiltration - Rapid onset with intrathecal injection for spinal anesthesia (drug is deposited
     close to nerve roots and spinal cord without having to diffuse through tissues) - Prolonged onset in peripheral nerve block such as brachial plexus block (drug is
     deposited at some distance from target nerves and have to diffuse through tissues)
   - Depends on fraction of non-ionized molecules - More rapid onset is expected when solution contains a greater fraction of non-
     ionized molecules - Alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) can maximize the fraction of
     non-ionized molecules
     ➡ Duration of action
   - Duration of action can be increased by adding vasoconstrictors or increasing dose
   - Duration of action increases with increased lipid solubility due to slower uptake and
     removal by bloodstream - More potent LAs are the longest persisting due to increased lipid solubility

3. Mechanism of action
   ➡ Penetrates nerves in the form of non-ionized lipid-soluble free base
   ➡ Binds to and inactivate voltage-gated Na+ channels in nerve plasma membrane and renders
   channels impermeable to Na+
   ➡ Number of channels falls below the minimum necessary for depolarization to reach the threshold
   ➡ Prevents action potential initiation and propagation and leads to nerve block
   [Image of page number, a white rectangle with "108" in the bottom right corner of the page.]

4. Different types of LA
   ➡Classification of LA

| Types      |               | Examples                 |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Esters** | Short-acting  | ➡ Procaine               |
|            |               | ➡ 2-Chloroprocaine       |
|            | Medium-acting | ➡ Cocaine                |
|            |               | ➡ Benzocaine             |
| **Amides** | Long-acting   | ➡ Tetracaine             |
|            | Medium-acting | ➡ Lidocaine (Lignocaine) |
|            |               | ➡ Mepivacaine            |
|            |               | ➡ Prilocaine             |
|            | Long-acting   | ➡ Bupivacaine            |
|            |               | ➡ Levobupivacaine        |
|            |               | ➡ Ropivacaine            |
|            |               | ➡ Etidocaine             |

5. Dosage of LA
   ➡ Application of local anaesthetic with adrenaline

- Adrenaline causes vasoconstriction
  - ↓ Absorption rate from injection site to systemic circulation and thus ↓ toxicity
  - ↑ Duration of action of LA and thus ↓ dosage required
- AVOID using LA with adrenaline in end-arteries - Penile block (Cause ischemia due to vasoconstriction) - Digital block (Cause ischemia due to vasoconstriction)
  ➡ Maximum dose limits

| Drugs                   | Dose limits |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| Lignocaine              | 3 mg/kg     |
| Lignocaine + Adrenaline | 7 mg/kg     |
| Bupivacaine             | 2.5 mg/kg   |

➡ Dosage calculation

- 70 kg patient, maximum dose of lignocaine = 70 x 3 = 210 mg/kg
- 1% Lignocaine = 10 mg/mL (1g/100 mL)
- 0.5% Lignocaine = 5 mg/mL
- Maximum volume of 0.5% Lignocaine in 70 kg patient = 210/5 = 42 mL

[Image of the number 109 in the bottom right corner of the page]

6. LA systemic toxicity (LAST) (due to presence of Na+ channels) (CNS → Respiratory → CVS)
   ➡CNS effects (CNS inhibitory fibers blocked first (e.g. muscle twitches/ convulsion) followed by
   CNS excitation (hallucination)

- Perioral paraesthesia
- Metallic taste
- Headache
- Mental status changes or anxiety
- Speech changes (Slurred speech)
- Visual changes (Blurred vision)
- Auditory changes (Tinnitus)
- Muscle twitches
- Seizure
- Coma
  ➡Respiratory effects
- Respiratory depression
  ➡CVS effects
- Bradycardia
- Hypotension
- VT/ VF/ Asystole

7. Management (antidote) of LA systemic toxicity
   ➡STOP the injection
   ➡ Call for help
   ➡Resuscitation trolley and manage ABC

- Full equipment to manage airway
- Defibrillators
- Cardiac drugs
  ➡ Monitors including NIBP, ECG and pulse oximeter
  ➡Oxygen supplementation
- 100% O2 should be given in cases of desaturation or cardiac depression
  ➡Management of arrhythmia
- Amiodarone for arrhythmia
- Arrhythmia secondary to LA toxicity is usually very refractory to treatment
  ➡Management of seizures
- Benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam/ midazolam) are preferred
  ➡ Lipid rescue therapy = Intralipid (20% lipid emulsion)
- Initial bolus 1.5 mL/kg IV over 1 min
- Continuous infusion 0.25 mL/kg/min
- Repeat bolus for persistent cardiac arrest
- Increase infusion to 0.5 mL/kg/min for persistent hypotension
- Continue infusion for at least 10 mins after hemodynamic stability is achieved
- Maximum dose = 10 mL/kg over first 30 mins

II. Neuraxial anesthesia

1. Overview

[Image Description: This is a detailed anatomical illustration showing a cross-sectional view of the spinal cord and surrounding structures. The illustration includes labels for various anatomical components such as the spinal cord, dura mater, epidural space, supraspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, interspinous ligament, arachnoid membrane, spinal anesthesia site, epidural anesthesia site, posterior longitudinal ligament, anterior longitudinal ligament, vertebrae, intervertebral disk and subarachnoid septum.]

➡Layers that will pass through during neuraxial anesthesia

- Skin →
- Subcutaneous tissues →
- Muscles →
- Supraspinous ligament →
- Interspinous ligament →
- Ligamentum flavum →
- Epidural space (epidural anesthesia) →
- Subarachnoid space (spinal anesthesia)
  ➡Anatomical landmarks
- C7 = Vertebra prominens
- T7 = Inferior border of scapula
- L1 = Termination of spinal cord
- L4 = Iliac crest (intercristal line joining both posterior superior iliac crest)
  ➡Dermatomes
- T4 = Nipple
- T7 Tip of xiphoid process
- T10 = Umbilicus
- T12 = Inguinal ligament
  ➡Sensory level required for surgical procedures commonly performed
- T4 = Caesarean delivery - Level required for surgery depends on dermatome level of skin incision and by
  level required for surgical manipulation - Low abdominal incision for C-section is made at T11-12 dermatome but a T4
  spinal level is required to prevent pain with peritoneal manipulation since the
  innervation of peritoneum is up to T4 level
- T10 = Total hip replacement/ Reduction and internal fixation of hip and femur fractures/
  Urological procedures
- L1 = Total knee replacement/ Knee arthroscopy
- L2-3 = Foot surgery
  111

2. Spinal/Epidural/ Combined spinal-epidural (CSE) anesthesia
   Overview

- Spinal anesthesia
  - Involves injection of LA into CSF in the lumbar spine to anesthetize nerves that exit the spinal cord
  - Used for procedures that is below umbilicus such as in the lower abdomen, pelvic (including Caesarean section), perineal and lower extremities
  - NOT applicable in thoracic level (NO thoracic spinal anesthesia available)
  - Commonly administered as a single shot
- Epidural anesthesia
  - Involves injection of LA into epidural space to anesthetize spinal nerve roots that traverse the space
  - Used for procedures including thoracic (thoracic epidural is available), abdominal, pelvic (including Caesarean section), perineal and lower extremity or supplement general anesthesia (GA) procedures as analgesia
  - Commonly administered via catheter and thus is a continuous technique
- Combined spinal-epidural (CSE) anesthesia
  - Combination of both spinal and epidural anesthetic technique

Anesthetic choices

- Local anesthetics (LA)
  - Bupivacaine is most commonly used
  - Example: Bupivacaine/ Lidocaine/ Ropivacaine/2-chloroprocaine/Tetracaine
- Opioids
  - Improve intraoperative and postoperative analgesia
  - Example: Morphine/ Fentanyl/ Remifentanil/ Sufentanil
- α-agonist
  - Increases density of sensory and motor block, prolongs duration of action by vasoconstriction
  - Example: Adrenaline/ Clonidine

112

➡Contraindications

- **Absolute** contraindications
  - Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) → Cerebral herniation
  - Uncontrolled bleeding diathesis → Epidural or subdural hematoma
  - Patient's refusal
- **Relative** contraindications
  - Spinal or soft tissue infection → Meningitis/ Osteomyelitis/ Epidural abscess

➡Procedures

- Patient is positioned in a lateral decubitus position
- Flexion of spine opens space between spinous processes
- Choice of spinal needle
  - Small gauge needle (24 – 27 Gauge) is preferred over large gauge needle to reduce post-dural puncture headache (PDPH)
  - Pencil-point needle (Whitacre and Sprotte) is preferred over cutting-tip needles (Quincke) to reduce post-dural puncture headache (PDPH)
- Spinal needle is inserted into a lumbar (L3–4 or L4–5) interspace with the midline or paramedian approach
- Epidural space is reached when there is **LOSS OF RESISTANCE**
- Subarachnoid space is reached when there is **CSF FLOW** to the end of spinal needle
- Local anesthetics (LA) is then injected
- Post-injection positioning
  - Supine position to allow anesthetic solution to spread intrathecally if a higher thoracic spinal level is required
  - Sitting position to allow anesthetic solution to sink to sacral nerve roots to achieve saddle block
- Hemodynamic management after spinal injection
  - Autonomic nerve both sympathetic and parasympathetic are blocked in addition to sensory and motor nerves
  - **Hypotension** = IV fluid + Vasopressors (Ephedrine/ Phenylephrine)
  - **Bradycardia** = Anti-cholinergics (Atropine/ Glycopyrrolate)

➡ Complications

- Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH)
  - Result from ongoing leakage of CSF from dural puncture site leading to traction of the meninges
  - Prevented by using smaller gauge and pencil-point needle
  - Managed by bed rest, increase fluid intake to increase production of CSF, avoidance of straining which can increase ICP and epidural blood patch
- Cerebral herniation
- Epidural or subdural hematoma
  - May potentially lead to cord compression
- Infection (Meningitis/ Osteomyelitis/ Epidural abscess)

113

# Lumps and bumps examination

I. Examination of skin lesions

1.  Preparation
    ➡ Introduce yourself
    ➡ 3C and hand hygiene
    ➡ **Positioning** = Comfortable position for patient
    ➡ Exposure = Expose area of complaint fully and contralateral side for comparison

2.  General examination
    ➡ Describe the surrounding environment (IV drop/ O2 supplementation/ Diet restriction)
    ➡ General appearance/ Vital signs/ Hydration status/ Body build (Cachexic/ Obese)
    ➡ Pallor/Jaundice/ Central cyanosis/ Lymphadenopathy/ Pulse/ Ankle edema

3.  Inspection
    ➡ Number
    - Solitary/ Multiple
      ➡ Site
    - Take reference from bony points
      ➡ Shape
    - Round/ Hemispheric/ Oval/ Exophytic growth
      ➡ Size
    - Measurement of dimension (**_ cm by _** cm)

"On inspection, there is a (number) (shape) lump on the (site) measuring *** cm by ***cm"
➡ Presence of scars
➡ Presence of discharge and bleeding
➡ Overlying skin changes - Discharge/ Bleeding/ Erythema/ Telangiectasia/ Ulceration/ Pigmentations - Presence of punctum
Ο Punctum suggests the abnormality arises from an epidermal appendage

"There is no scars, no bleeding or discharge and no overlying skin changes such as erythema,
telangiectasia, ulcerations, pigmentations or presence of punctum"

[Image of the number 115 at the bottom right of the page.]

4. Palpation (\*Ask for any **PAIN** before palpation)
   ➡ Skin temperature

- Palpate with the dorsum of hands
- Warmth indicates acute inflammation
  ➡ Tenderness
- Ask the patient if there is pain on palpation

"On palpation, the mass is (warm/ not warm) and is (tender/non-tender)"
➡ Surface

- Smooth/ Lobulated/ Rough/ Nodular
  ➡ Border (Margins)
- Well-circumscribed/ Poorly-defined (Irregular)
  ➡ Consistency
- Soft/ Firm/ Hard/ Rubbery
  ➡ Fluctuance
- Fluctuant/ Non-fluctuant
- Paget's sign = Rest 2 finger on opposite sides on lump and press down in the middle to note if the fingers move apart
  ➡ Pulsatility
- Pulsatile/ Non-pulsatile
- Suggestive of aneurysm or AV malformations

"The surface is (smooth/ lobulated/ rough/ nodular), the border is (well-defined/ poorly-defined), and it is (soft/firm/ hard/ rubbery) in consistency"

"The mass is (fluctuant/ non-fluctuant) and is (expansile/ pulsatile/ non-pulsatile)"
➡ Mobility

- Move the lump in 2 perpendicular planes
- Fixed/ Mobile in some or all directions
- Slip sign = Mass tends to slip away from examining finger on gentle pressure which is indicative of lipoma
  ➡ Relationships to surrounding structures
- Pinch the overlying skin
  - Not pinchable → Fixation to skin
- Ask the patient to tense the muscle
  - Less mobile → Fixation to muscle
  - More prominent → Above the muscle
  - Less prominent → Intramuscular/ Below the muscle

"The lump is (fixed/ mobile in horizontal and/or longitudinal direction), and regarding its relationship to surrounding structure, it is (fixed/ not fixed to overlying skin or muscles)"
➡ Transillumination

- Only indicated in large lumps by placing pen torch on one side
  ➡ Compressibility/ Reducibility
- Compressible lesions disappear on pressure and reappear on release which may indicate AV malformations
- Reducible lesions disappear on pressure and reappear with opposing force

5. Completion of examination
   ➡ Examination of draining lymph node + Look for other lumps

[Image of ulcer edges, there are five examples of how ulcers can look. Each ulcer edge has been labeled, starting with the top left ulcer as Sloping edge, top middle ulcer as Punched-out edge, top right ulcer as undermined edge, the bottom left ulcer is labeled as Rolled edge and the bottom right ulcer as Everted edge]
➡5 types of ulcer edges

- Sloping edge: Edge slopes gently from normal skin to base of ulcer
  - Example: Ischemic venous ulcer/ Healing ulcer/ Traumatic ulcer
- Punched-out edge: Edge drops down at right-angles to skin surface
  - Indicates a localized, full-thickness, area of skin loss surrounded by healthy tissue
  - Example: Ischemic ulcer/ Deep trophic ulcer/ Syphilitic ulcer/ Ulcer after gangrenous skin has sloughed
- Undermined edge: Disease causing ulcer spreads in and destroys subcutaneous tissues faster than it destroys overlying skin
  - Example: Tuberculous ulcers
- Rolled edge: Invasive cellular disease becomes necrotic at its centre but grows rapidly at its periphery
  - Example: Basal cell carcinoma
- Everted edge: Fast growing infiltrating cellular disease
  - Example: Squamous cell carcinoma/ Ulcerated adenocarcinoma

➡ 3 types of bases

- Granulation tissue (pink/red)
  - Red sheet of delicate capillary loops and fibroblasts covered by a thin layer of fibrin or plasma
  - Usually the first stage of healing process
- Dead tissue (i.e. Slough) (yellowish)
  - When a slough separates it may expose healthy tissues
- Tumour (black/brown)
  - Base of a squamous cell carcinoma is the malignant tissue itself
  - May be slightly vascular or necrotic but does not develop healthy granulation tissues

1.  Preparation
    ➡ Introduce yourself
    ➡ 3C and hand hygiene
    ➡ **Positioning** = Sit up
    ➡ **Exposure** = Entire neck including sternum and clavicle
2.  General examination
    ➡ Describe the surrounding environment (IV drop/ O2 supplementation/ Diet restriction)
    ➡ General appearance/ Vital signs/ Hydration status/ Body build (Cachexic/ Obese)
    - Assess for hoarseness when talking to patient
      ➡ Pallor/ Jaundice/ Central cyanosis/ Lymphadenopathy/ Pulse/ Ankle edema

[Image of Three sets of eyes showing bilateral lid retraction with no associated proptosis, bilateral lid retraction with bilateral proptosis, and unilateral lid retraction with unilateral proptosis, and Lid lag in downgaze.]

➡ Head and neck

- Pallor/ Jaundice/ Central cyanosis
- Thyroid eye-disease
  - Lid retraction[^1] → Stand behind and look from top of the head
  - Proptosis → Look from the side
  - Chemosis → Stand in front of patient
  - Lid lag[^1] → Stand in front of patient
  - Ophthalmoplegia/ Diplopia → Stand in front of patient

**Remarks:**[^1] Lid lag and lid retraction are result of excess sympathetic activity and are not specific to Grave's disease whereas the others are specific (Grave's ophthalmopathy)

➡ Hands

- Tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (AF)
- Warm and moist skin
- Finger clubbing (Thyroid acropachy) and onycholysis (nail lifting)
- Palmar erythema
- Fine postural tremor
- Pemberton's sign
  - Examiner hold patient's arms vertically above the head for 60s
  - Exacerbate obstructive symptoms by forcing the thyroid into thoracic inlet
  - Considered +ve with development of distended neck veins, facial plethora, inability to swallow, cyanosis, appearance or worsening of dyspnea and stridor
    ➡ Legs

3. Inspection

[Image of a neck with a visible scar in the middle. The scar is thin and runs horizontally across the front of the neck. The skin around the scar appears slightly discolored. The person's face is not visible, but the upper chest and neck are in clear view.]

➡ Scars

- Thyroidectomy scar - Kocher (collar) incision on anterior aspect of mid-neck
  ➡ Neck swelling
- Ask the patient to swallow and see if the mass moves up with swallowing
  - Mass that moves up with swallowing suggests goitre or thyroglossal cyst
  - Thyroid is enclosed in the pretracheal fascia which is anchored to the trachea and therefore moves up with swallowing
- Ask the patient to protrude his or her tongue - Mass that moves up with tongue protrusion suggests thyroglossal cyst - Thyroglossal cyst are cysts of epithelial remnants of thyroglossal tract - Presents characteristically as a midline neck mass at thyrohyoid membrane closely associated with hyoid bone
  ➡ Overlying skin changes
- Post-irradiation marks

121

4. Palpation
   ⇨ \*Ask for any **PAIN** before palpation
   ⇨ Lumps

- Ask the patient to swallow again when palpating
- Palpate for the lower border of the thyroid
  - Note any retrosternal extension by palpating the lower border
- Palpate for thrills
- Mass characterization - Size: Estimation of dimension - Site: Central neck mass/ Anterior triangle/ Posterior triangle (L/R) - Consistency: Soft/ Cystic/ Firm/ Hard - Surface: Smooth/ Nodular/ Multinodular - Mobility: Fixed to skin/ Fixed to underlying structures/ Moves with swallowing - Tenderness: Tender/ Non-tender
  ⇨ Lymphadenopathy
- Discrete, mobile, firm or rubbery but not rocky hard, slightly tender → Reactive LN
- Isolated, asymmetric, tender, warm and erythematous, fluctuant → Infected LN
- Firm, rubbery, rapidly expanding → Rapidly growing lymphoma
- Rock-hard, fixed (invasion through capsule and fixed to underlying structures) and non- tender → Malignancy
  ⇨ Tracheal deviation

5. Percussion
   ⇨ Percuss the sternum and manubrium downwards to upwards

- Normally should be resonant at the sternum
- Dull percussion note indicates retrosternal extension

6. Auscultation
   ⇨ Thyroid bruit

- Sign of increased blood flow in hyperthyroidism
- Grave's disease (**typical**)

7. Completion of examination
   ⇨ **ONLY** 3 conclusion can be derived based on **CLINICAL** examination of thyroid

- Thyroid nodule
- Multinodular goitre
- Diffuse goitre

# Breast examination

I. Examination of breast

1. General examination
   ➡Introduce yourself
   ➡3C and hand hygiene
   ➡ Preparation - Positioning = 45° or sitting position if bed is not available - Exposure = From clavicle to upper abdomen exposing both breast and axilla

2. Components of general examination
   ➡Describe the surrounding environment (IV drop/ O2 supplementation/ Diet restriction)
   ➡General appearance/ Vital signs/ Hydration status/ Body build (Cachexic/ Obese)
   ➡Pallor/ Jaundice/ Central cyanosis/ LYMPHADENOPATHY/ Pulse/ Ankle edema

3. Inspection
   ➡Look for size, symmetry and scars (3Ss) - Marked size difference of recent onset is likely to be pathological - Asymmetry in the breast contours - Scars from previous operation or biopsy for sentinel LN - Infra-mammillary folds/ Peri-areolar region/ Axillary skin folds
   ➡Look for overlying skin changes - Lump/ nodules - Ulceration - Discoloration: Erythema/ Hematoma/ Ecchymosis (in fat necrosis) - Puckering/ Dimpling: Underlying cancer - Peau d' orange (Orange-peel appearance): Underlying malignancy
   ➡Look for nipple changes (5Ds) - Deviation/ Displacement - Discoloration - Dermatitis (Eczema in Paget's disease of nipple) - Depression (Retraction/ Inversion) - Discharge
   ➡ Maneuvers - Patient is asked to raise her arms over her head - Expose lower part of the breast - Accentuate any tethering to the skin - Patient is asked to put her hands on her hips and press in to contract pectoral - Any other areas of retraction can be visualized
   [Image of the number "123" at the bottom right of the page.]

4. Palpation
   ➡ General principles

- ALWAYS ask for any pain
- Start palpation with the normal side
- Use fingers for palpation which are more sensitive
- Palpate along clock-face in 4 quadrants starting from **nipple-areolar complex** and radially outwards including the **axillary tail**
  - One hand retracts and stabilizes the breast while the other performs examination
  - Nipple discharge should be shown by the patient if possible
- Palpate for the axillary lymph nodes
  - Hold patient's elbow and allow her forearm to rest on your forearm and subsequently palpate with the other hand
  - Palpate for 5 major group of lymph nodes including anterior, posterior, medial, lateral and apical region
  - Comment on the number, site, size, consistency, tenderness and mobility

➡ Description of breast lump

- **Site**: Laterality (L/R) + Quadrant + Clock-face direction + Distance from nipple
- **Size**: Ruler can be used for precise measurement (\_ cm by \_cm)
- **Shape**: Oval/ Spherical
- **Edge**: Regular/ Irregular
- **Surface**: Smooth/ Nodular
- **Consistency**: Soft/ Firm/ Hard/ Rubbery/ Fluctuance
- **Tenderness**: Tender/ Non-tender
- **Mobility**: Skin fixation/ Skin tethering/ Muscle fixation
  - Skin fixation: Try to pick up the skin above the lump
  - Skin tethering: Lump behaves as if tied to skin by a piece of string/ Remains separate from skin and can be moved independently within certain limits/ Pulls the skin when move beyond limits
  - Muscle fixation: Move the lump in 2 perpendicular direction, then contract the pectoralis muscle by asking patient to press against her hip, move the lump again and the lesser the movement of lesion, the more likely it is fixed

[Illustration of a lump being pulled. A hand pulls a lump, and the skin around the lump indents. The caption reads: "If when a lump is pulled outside the arc the skin indents, it is tethered." ]

[Illustration of tethered lump. The tethered lump is stuck to the skin.]

[Illustration of fixed lump. The fixed lump is not able to move without moving the skin]

➡ Completion of breast examination

- Examine lungs for pleural effusion
- Examine liver for hepatomegaly
- Examine bone for bone tenderness

124

# Abdominal examination

I. **Examination of the abdomen**

1. Preparation
   ➡ Introduce yourself
   ➡ 3C and hand hygiene
   ➡ **Positioning** = Supine
   ➡ Exposure = From nipple to mid-thigh

2. General examination
   ➡ Describe the surrounding environment (IV drop/ O2 supplementation/ Diet restriction)
   ➡ Pressure stocking/ Heel protector/ Splinting
   ➡ General appearance/ Vital signs/ Hydration status/ Body build (Cachexic/ Obese)

- Motionless = Acute appendicitis/ Diffuse peritonitis
- Restlessness = Ureteric colic/ Intestinal colic
- Bending forward = Pancreatitis
  ➡ Pallor/ Jaundice/ Central cyanosis/ Lymphadenopathy/ Pulse/ Ankle edema

➡ Abdominal distension
➡ Abdominal and groin mass

- Ask the patient to inspire deeply to look at the movement with respiration
- Ask the patient to cough to increase intra-abdominal pressure to look for incisional and umbilical hernia
- Ask the patient to look down at the toes to tense the abdominal muscles - Any mass that becomes more prominent after protrusion indicates the mass is superficial to the muscle layer
  ➡ Visible pulsation
- Pulsatile expansile mass for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
  ➡ Visible peristalsis
  ➡ Dilated veins

4. Palpation
   ➡ \*Ask for any PAIN before palpation
   ➡ Abdominal tenderness
   ➡ Abdominal mass

- Size/ Border/ Surface/ Consistency/ Tenderness
- Assess whether the mass moves with respiration
- Palpate for the upper (get above) and lower border (get below) of them mass
  ➡ Peritoneal signs
- Guarding = Voluntary guarding of the abdomen that occurs due to contraction of abdominal muscle resulting from tenderness
- Rigidity = Constant involuntary reflex contraction of abdominal muscles
- Rebound tenderness = Tenderness when abdominal wall is compressed slowly and is released rapidly in which a sudden stab of pain results

  - Pressure areas include bottom, back and lateral surface of heel, medial and lateral malleoli, head of metatarsal and tips of toes
- Margin
  - Regular/ Irregular
- Edges
  - **Punched-out edge** = Arterial
  - **Sloping edge** = Venous
- Base
  - **Appearance of base:** Sloughy (_yellowish_)/ Necrotic (eschar) (_black/brown_)/ Granulation tissue (_pink/red_)
  - **Depth of ulcer:** Exposure of bone and tendons
  - **Presence of discharge:** Pus or bleeding
- Surrounding skin
  - Erythema (cellulitis)
  - Lipodermatosclerosis = Skin induration, redness and hyperpigmentation
- Tenderness
  - **Painful:** Arterial and venous
  - **Painless:** Neuropathic

[Image Description: This is an image of a handwritten note about the presence of ulcers, listing the site, size and shape of the ulcer, the margin which can be regular or irregular, the edges which can be punched out or sloping, the base which includes appearance, depth of the ulcer, and presence of discharge. It also lists the surrounding skin including erythema and lipodermatosclerosis and tenderness which can be painful or painless.]

]

Presence of gangrene

- Dry gangrene
  - Hard, dry and shrunken texture
  - Non-infected patch of gangrene
  - Clear line of demarcation between viable and black necrotic tissues
  - Safe and can be allowed to self-amputate after demarcation with precautions against infection
- Wet gangrene
  - Soft, moist and swollen texture
  - Infected patch of gangrene
  - No clear line of demarcation between viable and black necrotic tissues
  - Emergency requiring surgical debridement or amputation

4. Palpation (Feel)
   \*Ask for any **PAIN** before palpation
   Temperature
   - Use the dorsum (back) aspect of the hand to assess temperature as they are more sensitive
   - Runs up both hands simultaneously up the feet to the shin and thighs
   - Compare the temperature on both sides
     Capillary refill
   - Press hard on the nails or the pulp for a few seconds and release
   - Observe the time required for the blanched area to turn pink after stop pressing
   - Normal capillary refill < 2s
     Peripheral pulse
   - **Radial pulse**: Distal forearm near base of thumb
   - **Brachial pulse**: Antecubital fossa immediately medial to biceps tendon
   - **Carotid pulse**: Lateral to laryngeal prominence (thyroid cartilage)
   - **Femoral pulse**: Midway between ASIS and pubic symphysis
   - **Popliteal pulse**: Popliteal fossa at posterior compartment of knees
     - Best felt by compressing against posterior aspect of tibia
   - **Posterior tibial**: Posterior and inferior (1/3 way down) to medial malleolus
   - **Dorsalis pedis**: Dorsum of foot lateral to extensor halluces longus tendon
     Sensory function
   - Loss of sensation or paresthesia

136

5. Movement (Move)
   ➡ Motor function

- Muscle power to evaluate for weakness and paralysis
  ➡ Buerger's angle (ELEVATION-PALLOR-DEPENDENT-RUBOR) - Ask the patient to lie as close to the side of bed as possible - Hold the heel of the foot with the lower limb straightened - Slowly lift up the entire limb and stop when the toes become pale (white) - Look for ELEVATION-PALLOR - Estimation of the Buerger's angle - Normal limb can be raised to 90° without turning white - Buerger's angle < 20° indicates severe ischemia - Abduct the hip and gently let the leg drop over the edge of the bed - Look for DEPENDENT-RUBOR due to reactive hyperemia with the foot becoming purple-red

6. Auscultation
   ➡ Femoral bruit
   ➡ Popliteal bruit

7. Completion of examination
   ➡ BP measurement
   ➡ Ankle-brachial index (AKI)

- Provides a measure of severity of disease and confirm clinical suspicion of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease
- Resting systolic ankle BP (posterior tibial/ dorsalis pedis whichever is higher) is divided by systolic brachial BP (left/right arm whichever is higher)
  - Ankle pressure: Measured with BP cuff around the calf and the Doppler probe at the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial arteries
  - Brachial pressure: Measured with BP cuff around the arm and Doppler probe at brachial artery and the cuff is inflated until arterial signal is obliterated and slow deflate until signal just starts being detected at which the pressure is recorded

|             | - Arterial obstruction associated with ischemic rest pain, non-healing ulceration and gangrene |

- Exercise treadmill test - Indicated in patients with classical history of intermittent claudication or atypical extremity pain but normal ABI at rest - Measurement of ABI before and after patient exercise on treadmill and a ABI decrease of 0.2 indicates claudication
  ➡ Cardiovascular examination
  ➡ Abdominal examination
  ➡ Neurological examination

[Image Description: This image shows a table and some text about ankle brachial index. The table has two columns labelled ABI and Interpretation. The table rows describe different ABI value ranges and their corresponding interpretations, such as calcified artery, normal, claudication, and critical limb ischemia.]

II. Examination of venous system

1. Varicose veins
   ➡ Inspection

- Presence of scars
- Location of varicosities
  - Medial thigh and medial calf varicosities suggest long saphenous vein incompetence
  - Posterior calf varicosities suggest short saphenous vein incompetence
  - Anterolateral thigh and anterolateral calf varicosities suggest isolated incompetence of proximal anterolateral long saphenous tributary
- Signs of chronic venous insufficiency
  - Overlying skin changes (corona phlebectatica/ hyperpigmentation/ atrophie blanche/ venous stasis eczema/ lipodermatosclerosis)
  - Venous ulcers
    ➡ Palpation
- Palpate along the course of saphenous veins and their tributaries to feel for the varicosities and tenderness
- Palpate for peripheral pulses
  - Rule out peripheral artery disease since management of varicose vein include compression of limbs
- Pitting edema
  - Result of increase in volume of fluid in skin and subcutaneous tissue
  - Confined to ankle area usually but can extend to foot and rest of the leg
- Saphena varix
  - Palpate the inguinal region for a saphena varix which presents as a compressible lump that refills when released

[Illustration of a leg lying horizontally with a tourniquet applied. It shows a cross-section of the leg with the superficial veins empty. The different tissue layers are labeled: Superfi, Muscle, Deep, and Fascia. The text below states: "Tourniquet occludes the superficial veins".]

[Illustration showing two standing legs with a tourniquet applied to each. The left leg shows an incompetent communicating vein below the tourniquet filling the superficial veins below the tourniquet. The right leg shows an incompetent communicating vein above the tourniquet filling the superficial veins above the tourniquet.]

➡ Tourniquet tests

- Procedures
  - Patient should lie on a bed with the leg elevated
  - Veins are emptied by stroking the blood within the veins towards the heart
  - Tourniquet is pulled tight around the upper thigh and held in place by forceps
  - Patient is asked to stand up quickly and the legs are observed for refilling
- Superficial to deep valvular incompetence at sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ) which is 2.5 cm below and lateral to the pubic tubercle
  - Veins above tourniquet will rapidly fill
  - Veins below tourniquet will remain collapsed
  - Confirmed by releasing tourniquet and watching veins below rapidly filled
- Interpretation
  - **NO refilling below tourniquet** = Incompetence at level of tourniquet
  - **Refilling below tourniquet** = Other sites of incompetence below level of tourniquet
- Remarks
  - Test can be repeated with tourniquet moving progressively down the whole length of the leg to define all sites of superficial to deep vein incompetence (mid-thigh > below knee > mid-calf)
  - Easier and simpler to apply once below the knee to exclude short saphenous incompetence

➡ Completion of examination

- Auscultate over varicosities for AV malformations
- Examine inguinal region for mass or lymphadenopathy causing venous outflow obstruction

4. Diagnosis
   ➡Dermatological examination

- Dermoscopy
- Diascopy
  - Pressing a glass slide onto skin
- Wood's light
  - Examination of difference in pigmentation
    ➡Biochemical tests
- Serology
  - Anti-skin antibodies (pemphigoid and pemphigus)
  - ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-ENA, anti-Jo1
  - Anti-HIV
- Skin swab (bacterial/ virus)
- Skin scraping (fungus/ scabies mites)
- Skin prick test
  - Type I hypersensitivity reaction
  - Intradermal injection of common allergens
  - Allergens in atopic dermatitis
- Skin patch test
  - Type IV hypersensitivity reaction
  - Allergens in contact dermatitis
    ➡Biopsy in skin lesions
- Full-thickness tissue should be obtained via a punch or excisional biopsy
- Biopsy should include the edge, the thickest portion of the lesion or the area that is most
  abnormal in color, avoiding areas of crusting, ulceration or necrosis as these sites will
  most likely contain the distinctive pathology
  ➡Biopsy in soft tissue mass\*
- Fine needle aspiration (FNA)
  - Least invasive method of tissue diagnosis but is also the least informative
  - Able to determine the presence of malignancy and the histological type but often
    cannot determine the grade
  - Indeterminate results should always prompt definitive biopsy
  - First choice of biopsy method for lesions in H&N
- Core-needle biopsy
  - Provides the same information as an incisional biopsy if adequate
  - Indeterminate results should be confirmed by incisional or excisional biopsy
- Incisional biopsy
  - Gold standard for lesion > 3 cm
  - Incision parallel to the long axis of the extremity should be made such as the
    resulting scar can be excised at subsequent operation
  - Careful hemostasis to prevent hemorrhage from spread tumour is crucial
- Excisional biopsy
  - Gold standard for lesion < 3 cm or for tumours that are probably benign
  - Typically an elliptical incision is made around the tumour oriented parallel to the
    long axis of extremity and along skin lines of minimal tension
  - Complete excision with a thin margin of normal tissue followed by primary
    closure should be performed whenever possible

➡General features

- Benign rapidly growing cutaneous tumour that most commonly presents as a dome-shaped nodule with a central keratin-filled crater
- Distinguishing features is a clinical course characterized by rapid initial growth followed by a variable period of lesion stability and subsequent spontaneous resolution
  - Central core eventually separates and the lump collapses
  - Leave behind a deep indrawn scar
- Often mistaken as a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) as it grows rapidly
  - ALWAYS suspect malignancy in keratoacanthoma
  - Clinical and histopathological features closely resemble SCC and its relationship with SCC is controversial

  - No enlarged LN

➡ Diagnosis

- Excisional biopsy is required for confirmation of diagnosis
  - Preferred biopsy specimen is an excisional biopsy that extends into subcutaneous fat with at least 4 mm margin
- Classic pathological architecture of KA is a key component of diagnosis - Epidermal proliferation and hyperplasia with large eosinophilic keratinocytes - Central invagination with a central keratotic core
  ➡Treatment
- Surgical excision

153

8. Pyogenic granuloma (PG)

[Image Description: A clinical photograph showing a pyogenic granuloma on a finger. The granuloma appears as a small, raised, fleshy red growth protruding from the skin. In another photograph, a pyogenic granuloma with granulation and a blood clot on the surface is depicted. It is on the surface of a finger, and shows the texture and blood.]

➡General features

- Benign vascular tumour of the skin or mucous membranes
  - Pyogenic: Surface is often infected and ulcerated
  - Granuloma: Capillary loops grow vigorously and forms a protruding mass of tissue
    - Capillary loops normally form a layer of bright-red tissues known as granulation tissue in the base of a healing ulcer
- Characterized by rapidly growing, sessile or pedunculated clusters of capillaries that become covered with epithelium
  - Nodules will shrink but rarely goes completely once granulations have become completely covered with epithelium
- Rapidly growing lump which bleeds easily and discharges serous and purulent fluid

- **Composition**: Soft
- **Relations to surrounding structures**: Confined to skin

➡ Diagnosis

- Excisional biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis

154

IV. Subcutaneous lesions

1. Dermoid cyst

[Image Description: Photograph of a large cyst located behind the ear. The cyst is round and bulging, deforming the shape of the ear. The skin over the cyst appears smooth and stretched.]
[Image Description: Close-up photograph of a person's face, focusing on the right side of their forehead and eye area. The forehead has several small bumps, one larger bump between the eyebrow and hairline and some skin blemishes. The person has dark eyebrows and eyelashes. The photo is slightly blurry.]
[Image Description: Photograph of a hand with fingers slightly curled. There is a very small dot on the palm of the hand.]
[Image Description: Close-up photograph of a finger with a prominent cyst at its base. The cyst is slightly red and inflamed-looking. Text reads "An implantation dermoid cyst that appeared 2 years after a small stab wound at the base of the finger."]

➡ General features

- Dermoid cysts are formed by epidermal cells being sequestrated beneath skin
- Congenital dermoid cysts
  - Developmental cysts due to inclusion of embryonic epithelium at sites of embryonic fusion
  - Formed in intrauterine life when skin dermatomes fuse
- Acquired implantation cysts - Develops when a piece of skin survives after being forcibly implanted into subcutaneous tissue by an injury - Epithelium driven beneath skin by puncture wound leads to formation of cystic lesions
  ➡ History taking
- Congenital dermoid cysts
  - Chief complaint = Cosmetic disfigurement at birth
  - Cyst may be noticed at birth and becomes obvious few years later
- Acquired implantation cysts - History of an old injury and presence of scar closely related to dermoid cyst are the most significant diagnostic features - Cyst on the fingers may interfere with grip and touch - Implantation dermoid cyst rarely becomes infected
  156

➡ Physical examination (Congenital dermoid cysts)

- **Site**: Common in head and neck/ Periauricular region
  - Fusion of ophthalmic and maxillary facial process

[Image Description: The page shows text content about "Physical examination". Two types of dermoid cysts are being discussed: "Congenital dermoid cysts" and "Acquired implantation dermoid cysts". Each is characterized by site, size, shape, surface, consistency and relations to surrounding structures. For example, Congenital dermoid cysts are most commonly found in head and neck and have a soft consistency.]

2. Ganglion cyst

[Image of a human hand with a ganglion cyst on the back of the wrist. The cyst appears as a soft, multilocular swelling. The hand is resting in a neutral position, and the fingers are slightly flexed.]

[Image of a human hand with a small, tense ganglion on the back of the wrist, which is only clearly visible and palpable when the wrist is flexed. The hand is flexed at the wrist, and the fingers are curled.]

➡General features

- Fluid-filled swelling overlying a joint or tendon sheath
  - Misnomer since it is **NOT** related to nerves
  - Arise from herniation of dense connective tissue from tendon sheaths, ligaments, joint capsules, bursae and menisci
- Benign lesions but may lead to pain, weakness and loss of function
- Most common soft tissue tumours of the hand
  ➡History taking
- Occurs in ages between 20 – 60 years’ old
- Slow growing over months and years
- Disfiguring but **NOT** painful
  ➡Physical examination

  - Hard if small and soft if large
  - Presence of fluctuation
- **Associated symptoms:** Sensory or motor loss
  - Occasionally the cyst can impinge and cause nerve compression
- **Relations to surrounding structures:** Attached to fibrous tissue they originate from
  - Freely mobile to overlying skin as they are not attached to them
  - Becomes less mobile when structure such as joint capsule, tendon sheath or intramuscular septum are made tense if they are attached to them
  - May slip away from deeper structures when pressed giving a false impression that the contents have reduced into the joint

158

➡Treatment

- Treatment is usually conservative with either observation or non-surgical treatment such as aspiration given the limited morbidity of lesion and potential for spontaneous resolution
- Surgery is reserved for patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms despite initial conservative treatment
- Non-surgical treatment
  - Ganglion cyst aspiration
    - Patients should be informed than more than half of ganglion cysts treated with aspiration will recur within 1 year
- Surgical treatment
  - Surgical removal with excision of cyst along with its stalk

3. Neuroma/ Glioma/ Schwannoma
   ➡ Physical examination

- Can be moved in transverse direction (lateral) if attached to major nerve but not longitudinally
- **Tinel sign** = Symptoms of pain and paraesthesia can be elicited

V. Ulcers

1. Description of ulcers

[Image of five different types of ulcer edges. The first shows a "Sloping edge," where the skin gradually slopes down to the base of the ulcer, colored in light orange. The second shows a "Punched-out edge," where the edge is sharp and vertical, looking like a hole punched into the skin, colored in yellow. The third displays "Undermined edge," where the edge of the ulcer curves inward, creating an overhang, colored in light green. The fourth illustrates a "Rolled edge," where the skin rolls over onto itself, creating a round, raised border to the ulcer, colored in light blue. The fifth shows "Everted edge", where the skin turns outward, colored in light pink.]

➡ 5 types of ulcer edges

- **Sloping edge:** Edge slopes gently from normal skin to base of ulcer
  - Example: Ischemic venous ulcer/ Healing ulcer/ Traumatic ulcer
- **Punched-out edge:** Edge drops down at right-angles to skin surface
  - Indicates a localized, full-thickness, area of skin loss surrounded by healthy tissue
  - Example: Ischemic ulcer/ Deep trophic ulcer/ Syphilitic ulcer/ Ulcer after gangrenous skin has sloughed
- **Undermined edge:** Disease causing ulcer spreads in and destroys subcutaneous tissues faster than it destroys overlying skin
  - Example: Tuberculous ulcers
- **Rolled edge:** Invasive cellular disease becomes necrotic at its centre but grows rapidly at its periphery
  - Example: Basal cell carcinoma
- **Everted edge:** Fast growing infiltrating cellular disease
  - Example: Squamous cell carcinoma/ Ulcerated adenocarcinoma

➡ 3 types of bases

- Granulation tissue
  - Red sheet of delicate capillary loops and fibroblasts covered by a thin layer of fibrin or plasma
  - Usually the first stage of healing process
- Dead tissue (i.e. slough)
  - When a slough separates it may expose healthy tissues
- Tumour
  - Base of a squamous cell carcinoma is the malignant tissue itself
  - May be slightly vascular or necrotic but does not develop healthy granulation tissues

Keloids and hypertrophic scars
I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Keloids and hypertrophic scars are excessive tissue response to dermal injury by local fibroblast
   proliferation and overproduction of collagen

2. Differences between keloid and hypertrophic scars

## Infantile hemangioma

I. Overview

1. General features

- Infantile hemangiomas are benign and self-limited vascular tumours
- Characterized by phase of rapid proliferation and slow involution
  - Rapid proliferation of blood vessels in the first year of life (followed by)
  - Gradual regression of vascular component with replacement of fibrofatty tissues
- Some hemangioma can cause complications such as ulceration and permanent disfigurement
- Some may even compromise vital organ function including eyes, CNS and circulatory system
  - Hemangiomas in the liver, brain and GIT can rarely cause life-threatening complications as well

2. Classification of vascular lesions

- Vascular lesions of infants and children are classified into two major types including vascular tumours and vascular malformations
- Vascular tumours
  - Infantile hemangioma
  - Congenital hemangioma
    - Rare benign vascular tumours that are present and fully grown at birth
    - Presents as bossed plaques or exophytic masses located on H&N and limbs
    - Two major subtypes including
      - RICH = Rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma
      - NICH = Non-involuting congenital hemangioma
  - Pyogenic granuloma
  - Tufted angioma
  - Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma
- Vascular malformations
  - Capillary malformation
    - Port-wine stains
    - Nevus simplex (Macular stain)
  - Arteriovenous malformation
  - Lymphatic malformation
    - Macrocystic lymphatic malformation (Cystic hygroma)
    - Microcystic lymphatic malformation (Lymphangioma circumscriptum)
  - Venous malformation
- Differences between vascular tumours and malformations
  - Vascular tumours are usually absent at birth which subsequently has a rapid postnatal proliferation phase followed by slow spontaneous involution
  - Vascular malformations are all present at birth (though may not be evident) and grow in proportion to the child and generally do not regress

[Image of the number 163]

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ MOST common tumours of infancy
   ➡**Females** predominance (2 - 3x)

- Complicated hemangiomas are even more likely to occur among female infants
  ➡ Usually noticed within the first few days to months of life

III. Clinical manifestation

1. Clinical course
   ➡ Rapid proliferation of blood vessels in the first year of life (followed by)

- Undergo a proliferative phase that is generally rapid for the first several months
- Slow proliferation can continue for the first 6 – 12 months
- Proliferation after first year can occur but is uncommon
  ➡ Gradual regression of vascular component with replacement of fibrofatty tissues
- First clinical sign of involution within a superficial hemangioma is a color change from bright red to dark or violaceous red to gray which begins centrally as the tumour softens and flattens
- Complete involution occurs at an estimated rate of 10%/ year
  - 50% will have involuted by age of 5
  - 70% will have involuted by age of 7
  - 90% will have involuted by age of 9

2. Different types of infantile hemangioma
   ➡ Hemangioma morphology provides important clue to potential complications and can be categorized as localized, segmental or multiple

- Localized (most common) = Clear well-defined spatial containment and lack evidence of linear or geometric pattern
- Segmental = Demonstrate a linear or geographic presence over a specific cutaneous territory
  - _PHACE syndrome_ = **P**osterior fossa anomalies + **H**emangioma + **A**rterial anomalies + **C**ardiac anomalies + **E**ye anomalies
  - _Lumbosacral lesions_ = Associated with myelopathy, spinal bony, genitourinary and anorectal abnormalities
- Multiple = Arbitrarily defined as ≥ 5

[Image of the number 164, indicating the page number.]

# IV. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination

[Image of a baby's forehead with a large, raised, bright red tumor, resembling a strawberry in appearance, located between the eyebrows. The skin around the tumor appears normal. The baby's eyes are visible, looking slightly upward.]

[Image of a child's face, focusing on the area around the eye. The child's eye is looking to the right, and a small, irregular, bright red tumor is visible on the upper eyelid, close to the inner corner of the eye. The skin surrounding the tumor is slightly pale.]

➡Site: Common in H&N

- Can occur anywhere including skin, mucous membrane or internal organs
  ➡Size: Usually 1 – 2 cm in diameter but can grow up to 5 – 10 cm
  ➡Shape: Sessile hemisphere or pedunculated
  ➡Color: Bright-red tumour from skin surface that looks like a **strawberry**
  ➡Surface: Irregular and covered with a pitted epithelium
- May be small areas of ulcerations with scab
  ➡Composition: Soft
- Compressible but not pulsatile
- Gentle pressure can squeeze blood out leaving it collapsed and colorless
  ➡Relations to surrounding structures:
- Confined to skin
- Freely mobile over deep tissues
- No enlarged LN
- No other vascular abnormality
- Bright-red tumour from skin surface that looks like a strawberry

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Thrombocytopenia (Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon)
  - Severe thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy that results from platelet trapping within a vascular tumour
  - NOT associated with true infantile hemangioma but is now known to be associated with the other two types of vascular tumours including tufted angioma and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma

165

V. **Treatment**

1. **General principles**
   ➡ Indications for intervention

- Large rapidly growing cutaneous hemangioma
- Lesion in the periorbital, airway, liver or GIT
- Lesion in the face, nose, auricle or lips that are prone to disfigurement
- Large segmental or combined superficial and deep hemangioma in trauma-prone locations which have a tendency towards ulceration and scarring

2. **Medical treatment**
   ➡Uncomplicated hemangioma

- Serial observation (active non-intervention) is recommended
  - Hemangioma involute spontaneously after first year of life
  - Growth and involution should be monitored
- Topical ẞ-blockers
  - Indicated for small or superficial infantile hemangioma but **NOT** for treatment of complicated lesions
  - Example: Topical timolol
- Topical or intralesional corticosteroids - Now infrequently used since the introduction of topical timolol
  ➡ Complicated hemangioma
- Systemic ẞ-blockers
  - Non-selective ẞ-blockers which inhibits the growth and induces regression of infantile hemangioma
  - 1st line agent for hemangioma with potential to impair function or cause permanent disfigurement if there are no cardiac or neurovascular concerns
  - Side effects include hypotension, bradycardia, wheezing, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia
  - Contraindicated in patients with hypotension, shock, bradycardia, 2nd or 3rd degree heart block or history of bronchospasm or wheezing
  - Example: Oral propranolol
- Systemic corticosteroids
  - Largely supplanted by systemic ẞ-blockers
  - Only reserved for patients with complicated hemangioma for whom treatment with ẞ-blockers is contraindicated
  - Example: Oral prednisolone

3. **Surgical treatment**
   ➡Pulsed-dye laser (PDL)

- Most accepted use is the treatment of ulceration, post-involution erythema or telangiectasia
  ➡Excisional surgery
- Reserved for involuted lesions with residual scars or loose skin, hemangioma with inadequate involution after age 4, pedunculated cutaneous hemangioma (due to risk of scarring), small localized periorbital hemangioma and slow involuting lesions in cosmetically concerning locations

[Image Description: The image is a digital representation of a page from a medical document. The page is numbered 166 in the bottom right corner. The text discusses treatment options for hemangiomas, outlining general principles, medical treatments (both for uncomplicated and complicated cases), and surgical treatments. The document uses a mix of headers, bullet points, and indented lists to present information. Specific medications are mentioned, such as topical timolol and oral propranolol, as well as surgical procedures like pulsed-dye laser and excisional surgery.]

VI. **Complications**

1. Complications of hemangioma
   ➡ Ulceration

- **MOST** common complication of hemangioma
  ➡ Bleeding
- Bleeding is rarely profuse and can generally be stopped with application of direct pressure
  ➡ Airway hemangioma
- Risk of airway hemangioma is higher in segmental hemangiomas located in a cervicofacial, mandibular or “beard” distribution
- Presents with cough, progressive hoarseness, stridor, cyanosis and may progress to respiratory failure
  ➡ Periorbital hemangioma
- Majority of hemangioma that lead to visual complications involve the upper medial eyelid
- Astigmatism is the most common complication resulting from direct pressure of growing hemangioma on the cornea
- Stimulus-deprivation amblyopia is a result of physical obstruction of visual axis by hemangioma
- Subcutaneous periocular hemangioma are of particular concern since they may extend deep into the orbit causing exophthalmos or globe displacement with only subtle cutaneous manifestations

Lumps and bumps
Vascular malformations
I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Vascular malformations are anomalies of vessel morphogenesis

- Often resent at birth but often clinically subtle and becomes more apparent with time as
  they slowly expand in proportion to the infant's overall growth
- Endothelial turnover is normal unlike vascular tumours
  ➡Can be classified according to the type of vessels involved and flow characteristics
- **High-flow:** Arterial/ Arteriovenous
- **Low-flow:** Capillary/ Venous/ Lymphatics

2. Classification of vascular lesions
   ➡ Vascular lesions of infants and children are classified into two major types including vascular
   tumours and vascular malformations
   Vascular tumours

- Infantile hemangioma
- Congenital hemangioma
  - Rare benign vascular tumours that are present and fully grown at birth
  - Presents as bossed plaques or exophytic masses located on H&N and limbs
  - Two major subtypes including
    - RICH = Rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma
    - NICH = Non-involuting congenital hemangioma
- Pyogenic granuloma
- Tufted angioma
- Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma
  ➡Vascular malformations
- Capillary malformation
  - Port-wine stains
  - Nevus simplex (Macular stain)
- Arteriovenous malformation
- Lymphatic malformation
  - Macrocystic lymphatic malformation (Cystic hygroma)
  - Microcystic lymphatic malformation (Lymphangioma circumscriptum)
- Venous malformation
  ➡Differences between vascular tumours and malformations
- Vascular tumours are usually absent at birth which subsequently has a rapid postnatal
  proliferation phase followed by slow spontaneous involution
- Vascular malformations are all present at birth (though may not be evident) and grow in
  proportion to the child and generally do not regress

168

## II. Capillary malformation

1. Overview

➡ Port-wine stain

- Low-flow vascular malformations of dermal capillaries and post-capillary venules
- Mostly made up of small venules and capillaries
- Do **NOT** regress but grow in proportion to child's growth and become thicker and darker in color during adulthood
- Discoloration of skin leaving a deep purple-red color like port-wine (葡萄酒)
- Majority occurs as isolated cutaneous anomalies but is associated with other abnormalities or syndrome
- Association conditions
  - Glaucoma
  - Spinal dysraphism
  - Soft tissues and bone overgrowth
- Associated syndromes
  - Sturge-Weber syndrome\* (Classical triad = Facial port-wine stain + Capillary-venous malformation involving the brain + eye)
  - Parkes-Weber syndrome
  - Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome
  - Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
  - Macrocephaly-capillary malformation syndrome
  - Microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome

➡ Macular stain (Nevus simplex/ Salmon patch)

- Presents as single or multiple blanchable pink-red patches in newborn infants
- Occurs most commonly on eyelid, glabella and midline of the nape of the neck
- Less common sites include the scalp, nose, lip and back
- Associated conditions
  - Spinal dysraphism
  - Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
  - Macrocephaly-capillary malformation syndrome
  - Microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome

2. Clinical manifestation
   [Image Description: The image shows two photographs. The first photo depicts the side profile of a person's face and neck, with a prominent, reddish-purple lesion covering a large portion of their cheek. The lesion appears to be flat and irregular in shape. The second photo shows the face of a baby, with a large, red-colored lesion covering the entire left side of their face, extending from their forehead down to their cheek and chin. The lesion is well-defined and covers a significant area of their face.]

➡Site: Common on the face, neck, shoulder and buttock

- Lesion on the face tends to follow the distribution of trigeminal nerve branches (CN V)
- Locate at anywhere in the body typically with unilateral or segmental distribution that respects the midline
  ➡Size: Macules or patches
  ➡Shape: Variable
  ➡Color: Pink to red
- Color can be completely or partially blanchable
- Pressure cannot return skin to normal color as all blood vessels are abnormal
  ➡Surface: Smooth and flat but vessels can be prominent and may bleed
  ➡Relations to surrounding structures:
- Dilated subcutaneous veins beneath and around lesion
- Normal sensory innervation

3. Treatment
   ➡Pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy

- Considered the standard of care for the treatment of capillary malformations
- Based on the concept of selective photothermolysis with oxyhemoglobin as target
- Irreversibly damages the capillary vessel wall with minimal damage to overlying epidermis which leads to lightening of port wine stain without scarring

170

III. Lymphatic malformation

1. Overview
   ➡ Lymphatic malformations (LM) are benign low-flow vascular lesions composed of dilated lymphatic channels or cysts lined by endothelial cells with a lymphatic phenotype
   ➡ Macrocystic lymphatic malformation (Cystic hygroma)

- Defined as single or multiple cysts each ≥ 2 cm³
- Composed of collections of large interconnected lymphatic cysts lined by a thin endothelium
- Presents at birth as a large poorly delimitated, translucent, soft mass covered by normal skin commonly located commonly in cervicofacial region, axilla or lateral chest wall
- Associated with chromosomal abnormalities
  - Down syndrome
  - Turner syndrome
  - Noonan syndrome
    ➡ Microcystic lymphatic malformation (Lymphangioma circumscriptum)
- Defined as single or multiple cysts each < 2 cm³
- May be present at birth or appear in the first few years of life
- Presents as a cluster of clear, translucent or hemorrhagic vesicles that may intermittently leak lymphatic fluids
- Most commonly located at proximal extremities, trunk, axilla and oral cavity

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Benign neoplastic lesions

- Lipoma
- Neurofibroma
- Dermatofibroma
  ➡ Malignancy
- Lymphoma
- Neuroblastoma
- Rhabdomyosarcoma
- Teratoma
  ➡ Other vascular lesions
- Hemangioma
- Venous malformations

3. Diagnosis
   ➡ Ultrasound (USG)

- Prenatal USG can detect large lymphatic malformations
- Mass usually appears as complex and multilocular with septa of varying thickness
- Echogenicity correlates with small abnormal lymphatic channels
- Differentiates the type of malformation - Macrocystic malformations usually appear hypoechoic with internal septa and
  sometimes debris - Microcystic malformations usually appear as small cavities with reflective
  interfaces and maybe hyperechoic
  ➡ CT scan
- Mass generally appears as multilocular, poorly circumscribed and hypoattenuated with
  homogeneous fluid attenuation
- Contrast enhancement of peripheral margin and internal septa may be seen
  ➡ MRI scan
- Typical appearance of lymphatic mass - Multicystic with predominant fluid signal - Nominal to multiple septa and fatty components - Septations and peripheral wall may be seen with minimal enhancement
  ➡ FNA and biopsy
- Usually not needed for diagnosis

4. Treatment
   ➡ Non-surgical treatment

- Injection sclerotherapy
  - More effective in macrocystic lesion than in microcystic lesions (due to presence
    of numerous small cystic spaces)
  - Example: Bleomycin/ Doxycycline/Ethanol/ OK-432 (Picibanil) (not
    manufactured and used anymore)
- Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
  ➡ Surgical treatment
- Surgical excision
  - Effective treatment for microcystic malformations or macrocystic malformations
    unresponsive to injection sclerotherapy

## Lipoma

I. **Overview**

1. General features
   ➡ Layer = Subcutaneous (i.e. **NOT** attached to overlying skin in majority of cases)

- Occasionally can be intramuscular which will become more prominent if the muscle is contracted
  ➡ **MOST** common benign soft-tissue neoplasm
  ➡ Consists of mature fat cells enclosed by thin fibrous capsule which have become overactive and distended with fat to become palpable lumps
  ➡ Almost **NEVER** malignant and malignant transformation into liposarcoma is rare
- Sarcomatous elements occur in < 1% of cases
- Sarcomatous change is more likely in
  Ο Size: > 5 cm or rapidly growing mass
  Ο Site: Intramuscular (IM) (Thigh/ Shoulder) or retroperitoneal
  ➡ Lipomatosis occurs when multiple contiguous lipoma causes enlargement and distortion of subcutaneous tissues
- Usually occurs in the buttocks and neck
  ➡ Angiolipoma is also a benign tumour of adipocytes typically occurring in adolescents and young adults
- Resembles lipoma but are usually painful and tender

2. Associated conditions
   ➡ Multiple symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung's disease\*)

- Rare lipid metabolism disorder
- Characterized by presence of adipose tissue deposits localized in the face, neck, shoulders and upper arms
  ➡ Adiposis dolorosa (Dercum's disease)
- Rare disorder
- Characterized by multiple painful lipoma on limbs and trunk
- Associated with peripheral neuropathy

[Image Description: This is a page from a medical textbook about lumps and bumps, specifically lipomas. It lists general features such as the layer being subcutaneous and commonality as a benign soft tissue neoplasm. It describes what it is, how it grows, and when it is more likely to be sarcomatous. It also covers lipomatosis and angiolipoma with relevant details. Finally, it lists some associated conditions and their features.]

III. Diagnosis

1. History taking
   ➡History taking

- Occurs at any age but **NOT** common in children
- Slow growing for months or years and never regress
- Disfiguring or interfere with movement especially when it becomes pedunculated
- Previous history of lipoma being excised in the past
  - Ο Presence of scars indicate lipoma recurrence

2. Physical examination (\* = Characteristic positive sign)
   ➡**Site**: Common in subcutaneous tissue of upper limbs, chest, neck and shoulders
   ➡**Number**: Can be single, often multiple (lipomatosis)
   ➡**Size**: Varies
   ➡**Shape**: Spherical, hemispherical or discoid

- Lobulated as fat in the body is in the form of lobules
- Lobulation can be seen and felt on surface and edge of lump* (**characteristic**)
  ➡**Color**: Normal skin color and veins may be visible as faint blue streaks
  ➡**Surface**: Smooth* or lobulated\*
- Firm pressure or gently squeezing reveals depression between lobules
- Increased pressure within lipoma makes each lobule to bulge out between fine strands of fibrous tissues surrounding it
  ➡**Border**: Series of irregular curves corresponding to each lobule
- Well-defined (Encapsulated)/ Irregular
  ➡**Mobility**: Mobile in all direction\*
- **Slip sign**: Edge is soft, compressible and thin which might slip away from the examining fingers
  ➡ **Temperature**: Normal
  ➡**Tenderness**: Non-tender\*
  ➡**Consistency**: Soft but solid jelly-like fat
- The larger the lipoma, the more it appears to fluctuate but careful examination reveals that they are just yielding to pressure and spreading out in all directions (pseudo-fluctuation)
- **NO** fluid thrills
- Does **NOT** transilluminate
- Does **NOT** reduce or pulsate
  ➡**Relations to surrounding structures**: Depends
- Subcutaneous lipoma is not attached superficially or deeply and can be moved in all directions\*
- Attached deep to muscles which becomes prominent if being pushed out of muscle during relaxation or disappear when drawing into muscle during contraction
- Attached superficial to muscles which becomes prominent and fixed during contraction or disappear during relaxation
- No enlarged LN
- Normal surrounding tissues

175

IV. Treatment

1. General principles
   ➡ Asymptomatic lipoma can be observed
   ➡ Indications of treatment

- Symptomatic (pain/ cosmetic reasons)
- Large in size > 5 cm or rapidly growing tumours

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Local excision

- **Linear** excision along skin creases
  - In contrast to elliptical incision for sebaceous cyst to include punctum
- Surgical removal of fat cells and fibrous capsule
- Should be excised cleanly at the first operation to prevent recurrence
- Side effects include scarring, seroma and hematoma formation
  ➡ Liposuction
- May be considered in large lipoma with avulsion to avoid big scars

➡Layer = Skin appendages in the dermis (Cutaneous lesion!)
➡ MOST common cutaneous cysts
➡Refers to either epidermoid cyst or pilar cysts
➡Retention cyst due to obstruction of the sebaceous duct

- Arise from infundibular portions of **hair follicles**
- Mouth of sebaceous gland into the hair follicles is being blocked leading to distention with its own sebum secretions
  ➡May spontaneously discharge content through its punctum and regress or even disappear
  ➡Can be complicated by infection, ulceration and calcification

2. Associated conditions

3. Complications of sebaceous cyst

[Image Description: Two portrait-style photographs arranged horizontally. The left image shows a close-up of a human eye with a prominent, cone-shaped growth resembling a horn extending from the skin near the eye. The growth is light-colored, contrasting with the pinkish skin of the eyelid. The right image depicts a similar cone-shaped growth located on the eyebrow of an older person. The skin surrounding the growth appears rough and textured.]

➡Sebaceous horn

- Slow discharge of sebum from wide punctum hardens to form a conical spike
- Discharge is often removed as soon as they appear by friction from clothes and water
  - Sebaceous horn can only grow if patient fails to wash the skin over cyst
- Can be pulled out of the cyst as there is no intrinsic living structure

[Image Description: Two portrait-style photographs arranged horizontally. The left image shows a red, bulging growth on an elderly person's scalp, surrounded by gray hair. The growth has a small, dark lesion at its center. The right image shows a scabbed over skin lesion with surrounding dry flaky skin and gray hair with a dark hair pin laying on top of the hair.]

➡Cock's peculiar tumour

- Infection and ulceration of cyst wall leading to an infected, open, granulating, edematous sebaceous cyst

III. Diagnosis

1. History taking
   ➡ Occurs in all age groups
   ➡ Present in early adulthood and middle age
   ➡ Slow growing and usually present for several years before complaining about it
2. Physical examination
   ➡ **Site:** Hairy parts of body with sebaceous glands

- Common sites include scalp, neck, shoulder, back and scrotum
- **NO** sebaceous glands on palms and soles since there is no hair follicles!
  ➡ **Number:** Usually single, can be multiple
  ➡ **Size:** Few mm to 4 – 5 cm in diameter and often multiple
  ➡ **Shape:** Spherical
  ➡ **Color:** Bluish tint or discoloration*
  ➡ **Surface:** Smooth*
  ➡ **Edge:** Well-defined* and easy to feel as it lies in subcutaneous fat
  ➡ **Mobility:** Mobile in all direction*
  _ Absence of slip sign
  ➡ **Temperature:** Normal
  ➡ **Tenderness:** Non-tender if uncomplicated/ Tender indicates infection of cyst
  ➡ **Consistency:** Firm_
  - Fluctuant\*
  - **NO** transillumination as it is full of sebum
    ➡ **Relations to surrounding structures:** Confined to skin
  - Attached to overlying skin\*
  - Presence of punctum\* (50%)
    - Specific but not sensitive
    - Point of fixation gets pulled inwards on enlargement of the mass
  - Cysts are **NOT** attached deeply as they arise from skin structure and lie in subcutaneous tissue
  - No enlarged LN

IV. Treatment

1. General principles
   ➡ **ALL** sebaceous cysts are recommended to be excised
   - Prevent sebaceous cysts from being infected which makes the sebaceous cysts more difficult to excise due to adhesions and cellulitis
   - Requires incision and drainage (I&D) first to allow infected cysts o regress first
2. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Local excision
   - **Elliptical** incision for sebaceous cyst to include punctum
     - Prevent recurrence by removal of elliptical portion of skin containing punctum along the lines of Langers
     - Recurrence is due to incomplete removal with wall of cyst behind
   - Complete excision of cyst and contents

# Lumps and Bumps

## Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of skin

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Malignant tumour arising from the epidermis forming the superficial keratinous squamous layer
   ➡ SCC has a higher potential for local recurrence and regional and distant metastasis than BCC
   ➡ Location of SCC - Head and neck (55%) - Dorsum of hands and forearms (18%) - Legs (13%) - Arms (3%) - Shoulder or back (4%) - Chest or abdomen (4%)
   ➡ Mode of spread - Local spread - Infiltration into epidermis, dermis, adjacent tissues - Lymphatic spread - Regional lymph nodes is the MOST common site of metastasis - Hematogenous spread - Lung - Liver - Bone - Brain

[Image of the number '181' possibly indicating the page number]

2. Associated conditions with SCC

[Image of Bowen's disease (SCC In-situ), showcasing a close-up of skin with irregular, reddish patches, scaling, and crusting, indicative of the disease.]

Bowen's disease (SCC In-situ)

[Image of Solar keratosis (SCC in-situ) on a bald head, showing multiple small, rough, scaly spots of varying sizes distributed across the scalp, indicating sun damage and potential pre-cancerous lesions.]

Solar keratosis (SCC in-situ)

[Image of Marjolin's ulcer showcasing a side view of a lower extremity. The ulcer is on the ankle and has a large mass of red and raw tissue, with a visible everted edge, surrounded by chronically damaged skin.]

Majolin ulcer -
note everted edge of SCC and
chronicity of surrounding skin

Marjolin's ulcer

➡Bowen's disease (SCC-in-situ)

- SCC in-situ lesions tend to grow slowly enlarging over course of years
- Progresses into SCC eventually
- Presents as a well-demarcated, erythematous scaly patch or plaque
- Named as "Erythroplasia of Queyrat" when penis is involved

➡Solar keratosis (SCC-in-situ)

- Cutaneous lesion that results from the proliferation of atypical epidermal keratinocytes
- Represents early lesions on a continuum with SCC and occasionally progress to SCC
- Presents as multiple erythematous scaly macules or papules on sites of chronic sun exposure which is a major risk factor

➡Marjolin's ulcer

- Describes a rare type of SCC that arise in long-standing benign ulcers or scars
  - Commonest ulcer = Venous ulcer
  - Commonest scar = Burns
- Malignant transformation is slow with an average latency time of 30 years
- Present initially as an ulceration that fails to heal and nodules develop as the lesion progresses

182

II. Etiology

1. Risk factors
   ➡ Non-modifiable factors - Aging (most important) - White ethnicity - Family history of SCC
   ➡ Modifiable factors - Smoking - UV light exposure (most important) - Arsenic exposure - Ionizing radiation - Previous radiotherapy - Immunosuppression - HIV infection - Solid organ transplant recipients - Long-term corticosteroid use - Medical conditions - Bowen's diseases - Solar keratosis - Marjolin's ulcer - Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) - HPV infection
2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Keratoacanthoma
   ➡ Pyogenic granuloma
   ➡ Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
   ➡ Malignant melanoma
   ➡ Infected seborrheic wart
   ➡ Tumour of skin appendages

The layout is clean and organized, with bullet points and arrows used to enhance readability and emphasize different aspects of each topic.]

### Diagnosis

1. History taking
   - Chief complaint = Lump or ulcer than has bleeding and discharge
     - Begins as nodules which enlarges with central necrosis
     - Develop into a circular ulcer with prominent everted edges
     - Ulcers enlarges and becomes irregular with pain, bleeding and discharge (Bleeding is more common in SCC than BCC)
     - Steady growth for 1-2 months before patients complain about it

2. Physical examination
   - Site: Common in exposed skin area of head and neck, hands, forearm and upper trunk
   - Number: Usually single, can be multiple
   - Shape: Nodule/ Ulcer
     - Begins as a nodule and becomes an ulcer with the centre becoming necrotic and slough away as the tumour enlarges
   - Color: Dark red-brown color as it is very vascular
     - Ulcer may be cover with old coagulated blood or serum
   - Edge: Everted edge and well-defined (characterized)\*
     - Excessive tissue growth raises it above normal skin surface
     - Initially circular with everted edge and become irregular as tumour enlarges
     - Edge is dark, red-brown in color due to high vascularity
   - Temperature: Normal
   - Base: Necrotic tumour covered with serum and blood
     - Can present with copious, bloody, purulent and foul-smelling discharge
     - Granulation tissue may be present but tends to be pale and unhealthy
     - Deeper tissues may be exposed
   - Depth: Soft tissue are easily invaded and leave a deep ulcer when they slough
   - Tenderness: Non-tender\*
   - Consistency: Firm
   - Relations to surrounding structures: Depends
     - Usually mobile but can be immobile if invades and fixed into deep structures
     - Tumour has spread beyond skin and subcutaneous tissue to bone, tendon and muscle if the ulcer is immobile
     - Surround tissues may be thickened and edematous
     - Invasion of blood vessels can cause thrombosis and ischemia
     - Subcutaneous spread may involve surrounding nerves
     - LN is often enlarged and should be assumed LN contains metastasis\*
   - Completion of examination
     - Example for lymphadenopathy for LN metastasis
       - Lip and anterior mouth lesions → Submental nodes
       - Nose and cheek lesions → Submandibular nodes
       - Auricular lesions → Post-auricular nodes
       - Posterior scalp lesions → Occipital nodes
       - Anterior scalp, forehead and temple lesions → Parotid nodes
     - Examine for pleural effusion for lung metastasis
     - Examine for hepatomegaly for liver metastasis

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡ Biopsy of skin lesions - Biopsy is required for histopathological examination to confirm SCC - Assessment of tumour depth, tumour differentiation and perineural invasion which are factors affecting staging and prognosis
   ➡ FNAC or biopsy of lymph nodes - +ve FNAC or biopsy results should prompt further radiological imaging to provide more information on the size, number and location of LNs for disease staging

4. Radiological tests
   ➡ Indications of radiological imaging in imaging is based on presence of high-risk features of SCC

| Types                 |                    Description                    |
| --------------------- | :-----------------------------------------------: |
| Clinical features     |                   ➡ Size ≥ 2 cm                   |
|                       |      ➡ Location at ear, lip or genital areas      |
|                       | ➡ Arises from ulcers, sinus tract, scars or burns |
|                       |                  ➡ Rapid growth                   |
|                       |                ➡ Local recurrence                 |
|                       |             ➡ Immunosuppressed hosts              |
| Histological features |              ➡ Poorly differentiated              |
|                       |           ➡ Perineural involvement[^1]            |
|                       |            ➡ Intravascular involvement            |
|                       |        ➡ Depth ≥ 4 mm/ Clark's level IV/V         |

➡ CT scan - Commonly used for evaluation of regional LN status to detect LN metastasis - CT is superior to MRI for evaluation of skull base invasion, involvement of cartilage and bone erosions or destruction
➡ MRI scan - Commonly used for evaluation of regional LN status to detect LN metastasis - MRI is superior to CT in evaluation for perineural invasion, providing soft tissue contrast, defining tissue planes and identify bone marrow infiltration
➡ PET scan - Ability to detect metastasis in sites of fibrosis, necrosis and dense scarring related to radiotherapy and areas that may be difficult to assess with other studies - Evaluation of distant metastasis in lung, liver, bone and brain

IV. Treatment

1. Medical treatment
   ➡ Chemotherapy

- Topical 5-FU - Indicated for treatment of solar keratosis - NOT FDA approved for Bowen's disease but is still widely used for this indication when other treatment modalities are impractical for patients who refuse surgical treatment
  ➡Photodynamic therapy
- Indicated for treatment of Bowen's disease
- NOT used for treatment of invasive SCC
  ➡ Radiotherapy
- Indicated for treatment of invasive SCC
- Reserved primarily for older patients and patients who are not surgical candidates due to its potential long-term adverse effects

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡Surgical treatment

- Surgical margins (local control)
  - Small lesions < 2 cm requires surgical margin of 4 mm
  - Large lesions ≥ 2 cm requires surgical margin of at least 1 cm (10 mm)
- Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) (local control)
  - Specialized surgical technique indicated for removing high-risk skin cancers
  - Both visible portion of tumours and deeper layers of tissues are excised under LA one layer at a time and examine under frozen sections
  - Process is repeated until negative margins are achieved and immediate reconstruction with flaps or grafts are performed
  - Allows histological evaluation of the entire peripheral and deep margins
  - Advantages over standard surgical excision includes higher cure rate, lower recurrence rate maximal tissue preservation in anatomically and cosmetic sensitive sites and immediate reconstruction
  - Disadvantages include labour intensiveness and time-consuming
- Lymph node dissection (regional control) - Lymph node dissection if involved
  ➡ Cryotherapy
- Indicated for low-risk invasive SCC or Bowen's disease
- Destroys malignant cells by freezing and thawing
  ➡Electrosurgery
- Indicated for low-risk invasive SCC or Bowen's disease
- Electrodesiccation and curettage (ED&C)

V. Complication

1. Complications of SCC
   ➡ Infection
   ➡ Bleeding

- Massive and fatal if SCC erodes into a large vessel
  [Image of a page number at the bottom right, it says 186]

# Lumps and Bumps

# Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Locally invasive carcinoma of the basal layer of the epidermis and its appendages
   ➡Locations of BCC

- Common in exposed skin especially in countries with a high incidence of UV radiation
  ➡Tumour of low metastatic potential when compared with SCC
- Does **NOT** metastasize but can infiltrate adjacent tissues leading to destructive of skin and surrounding structure including bone

2. Subtypes of BCC
   ➡Nodular (60%)

- **MOST** common form of BCCs
- Presents as a papule which have a rolled border with frequent ulceration and the term "rodent ulcer" is referred to these ulcerated nodular BCCs
  ➡Superficial (30%)
- Usually asymptomatic and tends to grow slowly
- Associated with a better prognosis
  ➡Morpheaform
- Aggressive form of BCC
  ➡Basosquamous cell carcinoma
- Aggressive form of BCC

[A photograph shows a close-up of a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with a rolled edge and a central necrotic base, the lesion is located on the skin near the ear. The center of the lesion is dark and crusty, while the edges are raised and have a rolled appearance.]

[A photograph shows a close-up of a face with a small, pigmented basal cell carcinoma on the skin. The lesion is a small, dark spot on the cheek.]

[A photograph shows a close-up of a nodular lesion spreading outwards and leaving a collapsed, scarred centre. The lesion is slightly raised and has a smooth, shiny surface. The surrounding skin is red and inflamed.]

[A photograph shows a close-up of a lesion with a deep, scarred centre without a noticeably raised edge. The skin around the lesion is pale and smooth.]

[A photograph shows a close-up of a true 'rodent ulcer'. The basal cell carcinoma has destroyed the orbit and the eye, leaving a large, open wound. The surrounding skin is red and inflamed.]

187

II. **Epidemiology**

1. General epidemiology
   ➡Males predominance
   ➡Occurs more commonly in advanced age

- Related to duration of exposure of skin to UV light
  ➡Common in countries that have bright sunlight
  ➡Particularly common in Caucasians (White ethnicity) and very uncommon in dark-skinned
  populations

III. **Etiology**

1. Risk factors
   ➡Non-modifiable factors

- Aging
- White ethnicity
- Family history of BCC
  ➡Modifiable factors
- UV light exposure (**most important**)
- Arsenic exposure
- Ionizing radiation
  - Previous radiotherapy
- Immunosuppression
  - HIV infection
  - Solid organ transplant recipients
  - Long-term corticosteroid use
- Medical conditions
  - Gorlin's syndrome (Basal cell nevus syndrome)
  - Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Keratoacanthoma
   ➡Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
   ➡Malignant melanoma

IV. **Diagnosis**

1. History taking
   ➡Chief complaint = Persistent nodule or ulcer with a central scab that repeatedly falls off and then
   reforms

- Begins as a nodule and develop a rolled-edge ulcer when the central epithelium dies
- Nodule will enlarge if the centre of tumour does not necrose and ulcerate leading to a
  cystic appearance
- Slow growing and usually been present for months or years before patients seek advice
  - Long history may give patient a false impression that the lesion is benign
- May cause itchiness and usually painless
- May give bleeding and serous discharge (Bleeding is less common in BCC than SCC)

2. Physical examination

[Illustration of a human head in profile, with a shaded area indicating the most common site of basal cell carcinoma. A line is drawn from the corner of the mouth to the earlobe. Next to it, is an illustration of the rolled edge of a wound.]

Site: Most common on the face (70%) above a line drawn from the corner of mouth to earlobe

- Common in sun-exposed skin areas
- Can also be present in skin of scalp, neck, trunk, arms and hands
  ➡Number: Can be single, usually multiple
  ➡Size: Quite small but often multiple
  ➡Shape: Nodule/ Pigmented nodule/ Ulcer/ Deep eroding ulcer (rodent ulcer) \*
- Tumour always start as a nodule and develop a rolled-edge ulcer when the central
  epithelium dies (ulcerated nodular BCC) which is the classic "rodent ulcer"\*
- Nodule will enlarge if the centre of tumour does not necrose and ulcerate leading to a
  cystic appearance\*
  ➡Color: Glistening and slightly transparent/ Pigmented
- Gives impression that there are pearl-white nodules of tissue below epidermis
- Can be brown if there is excess melanin
  Surface: Smooth
- Covered with fine distinct blood vessels
  ➡Edge: Rolled edge and well-defined (characteristic)\*
- Rolled edge is circular when nodule first ulcerates
- Becomes irregular when malignant cells spread
- Appears as irregular raised edge surrounding flat white scar when ulcer heals known as
  "bush-fire BCC"
  ➡ Temperature: Normal
  Base: Base of rodent ulcer is covered with a coat of dried serum and epithelial cells
- Consists of fat, bone, muscle covered with poor quality granulation tissue
- Bleed slightly if the layer is picked off
  ➡Tenderness: Non-tender\*
  ➡Consistency: Firm
  ➡Relations to surrounding structures: Superficial and confined to skin (majority)
- Attached to overlying skin\*
- Freely mobile over deep structures\*
- Fixation of ulcer indicates it has deep invasion as in rodent ulcers\*
- NO enlarged LN\* (RARE lymphatic spread in comparison to SCC)

189

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡Biopsy of skin lesions

- Biopsy is required for histopathological examination to confirm BCC
- Full-thickness tissue should be obtained via a punch or excisional biopsy
- Biopsy should include the edge, the thickest portion of the lesion or the area that is most abnormal in color, avoiding areas of crusting, ulceration or necrosis as these sites will most likely contain the distinctive pathology

V. Treatment

1. Medical treatment
   ➡Chemotherapy

- Topical 5-FU
- Interferes with DNA synthesis by inhibiting thymidylate synthetase
- Topical Imiquimod
- Immune response modifier that is FDA approved for treatment of superficial BCCs in low-risk sites
  ➡Photodynamic therapy
- Uses light and porphyrins to cause tumour destruction
  ➡ Radiotherapy
- Effective for treatment of BCC at high risk of recurrence
- Reasonable alternatives in older patients with high-risk lesions who are not candidates for surgical excision

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡Surgical treatment

- Surgical excision
- Can be performed faster than Mohs surgery and is relatively inexpensive
- Performed in an outpatient setting under LA and is usually well-tolerated
- Excised tissue should be sent for pathological assessment for tumour margins
- Surgical defect is immediately repaired either by side-by-side closure or the use of adjacent tissue flaps, skin grafts or rarely distant tissue flaps
- Electrodessication and curettage (ED&C)
- Commonly used for management of BCC in which treatment is quick and generally well-tolerated
- Does **NOT** allow histological confirmation of tumour removal and is highly operator dependent
- Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS)
- Specialized surgical technique indicated for removing high-risk skin cancers
- Both visible portion of tumours and deeper layers of tissues are excised under LA one layer at a time and examine under frozen sections
- Process is repeated until negative margins are achieved and immediate reconstruction with flaps or grafts are performed
- Allows histological evaluation of the entire peripheral and deep margins
- Advantages over standard surgical excision includes higher cure rate, lower recurrence rate maximal tissue preservation in anatomically and cosmetic sensitive sites and immediate reconstruction
- Disadvantages include labour intensiveness and time-consuming

# Lumps and Bumps

## Melanoma

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ MOST severe form of skin cancer
   ➡ May arise from pre-existing mole (pigmented nevus) or arise de novo
   ➡ Most melanoma arises as superficial tumours that are confined to epidermis which is known as the "horizontal/ radial" growth phase

- Melanoma is almost always curable by surgical excision alone
  ➡ Melanoma that infiltrates into dermis which is known as "vertical" growth phase
- Melanoma have metastatic potential
  ➡ Mode of spread
- Spread in lymphatics to regional LN
- Spread in blood (hematogenous) to liver, lung and brain

[Image of a superficial spreading melanoma on a leg. The lesion is thin, with an irregular edge and varying degrees of pigmentation. A paper ruler is placed next to it.]

[Image of a superficial spreading melanoma with an amelanotic nodular area on a person's skin. The nodule had appeared within the previous month and had itched and bled.]

[Image of a nodular melanoma arising in a long-standing benign mole (pigmented naevus) on a person's skin.]

[Image of nodules of malignant melanoma arising in a patch of Hutchinson's lentigo on a person's face, specifically the cheek, which had been present for many years. The eye is covered with a black rectangle.]

[Image of multiple metastatic nodules of melanoma that appeared 4 years after the primary lesion (which was behind the knee) had been excised. The nodules are spread along the leg.]

192

II. Etiology

1. Predisposing factors of melanoma
   ➡Congenital conditions

- Family history (1º relative) of melanoma or other skin cancers
- Xeroderma pigmentosum
- Familial atypical mole-melanoma syndrome
- Dysplastic naevus syndrome
- Large congenital naevus
  ➡Acquired conditions
- Sunlight exposure
- Previous melanoma
- Malignant transformation (from pigmented naevus)
  III. Pathogenesis

1. TNM staging of melanoma
   ➡ 5 Stages of melanoma

- Stage 0 = In-situ (Intraepithelial) melanoma
- Stage I = Localized invasive cutaneous disease
- Stage II = Localized invasive cutaneous disease
- Stage III = Regional nodal disease
- Stage IV = Distant metastatic disease
  IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Cardinal symptoms of malignant changes in a pigmented nevus (mole)
   ➡Increase in size, shape or thickness

- Long standing mole that grows steadily over a period of weeks to months
- Mole becomes wider and thicker and changes from a plaque to a nodule
  ➡Changes in surface
- Loss of normal skin markings (creases) over the mole
- Becomes rough and scaly
  ➡Changes in color
- Darker as malignant melanocytes produce more melanin
- Some turns almost black, some turns blue-purple with increased vascularity and some
  does not change at all (Patchy color change)
  ➡ Itchiness
- Early and significant symptom
- Associated with a pale-pink halo around the mole
  ➡ Bleeding
- Late and slight sign
- Overlying epithelium becomes anoxic as tumour cells multiply
- Ulcerate spontaneously or breaks down after injury
  ➡ Evidence of local or distant spread
- Spread diffusely to surrounding skin to produce a brown halo around the primary lesion
- Spread through the skin in intradermal lymphatics and become small intradermal nodules
  known as satellite nodules

2. Signs and symptoms of melanoma

[Image Description: Three images labeled A, B, and C respectively, demonstrating the Ugly Duckling sign of melanoma.
Image A shows a collection of moles and one standout mole that is larger and darker with a blue arrow pointing to it.
Image B shows a collection of moles, where one is lighter in color and protruding, with a blue arrow pointing to it.
Image C shows a single dark mole on plain background.]

Figure 1. Three Examples of an Ugly Duckling

➡Ugly-duckling sign

- Individual with multiple nevi tends to exhibit one or more predominant morphological types which is the signature nevi
- Pigmented lesion that is obviously different from the other must be considered suspicious

➡ ABCDE acronym (New York University 1985) to identify melanoma at early stage

- Asymmetry
  - If a lesion is bisected then one half is not identical to the other half
- Border irregularities
- Color variegation
  - Presence of multiple shades of red, blue, black, gray or white
- Diameter ≥ 6 mm
- Evolution (Enlarging/Elevation)
  - Lesion that is changing in size, shape, color or a new lesion
  - Incorporate the fundamental concept of change including modification of a preexisting nevus over time or development of new lesion

➡Addition EFG acronym

- Indicated for less common subtypes of melanoma including nodular melanoma
  - Elevation
  - Firm on palpation
  - Growing continuously for 1 month

194

# Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡ Physical examination

- **Site**: Occurs in head and neck, limbs and trunk
- **Number**: Usually single, may be satellite lesions
- **Size**: Small initially (0.5–2 cm in diameter)
- **Shape**: Ulcer
- **Color**: Variegated
- **Surface**: Smooth epithelium initially
  - Becomes an ulcer covered with crust (blood and serum) when the epithelium dies from ischemic necrosis
  - Infection and bleeding may make the surface of tumour wet, soft and boggy
- **Edge**: Well-defined and irregular
- **Temperature**: Normal\*
- **Tenderness**: Non-tender\*
- **Consistency**: Firm
  - Satellite nodules feel hard
- **Relations to surrounding structures**: Confined to skin and moves with it
  - Attached to overlying skin
  - Mobile and move with skin
  - LN may be enlarged and should palpate for regional lymphadenopathy
  - Nodules of melanoma may be palpable when feeling the subcutaneous tissues along the course of lymphatics
- Completion of examination
  - Example for lymphadenopathy for _LN_ metastasis
  - Examine for pleural effusion for _lung_ metastasis
  - Examine for hepatomegaly for _liver_ metastasis
  - Examine for focal neurological signs for _brain_ metastasis

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡ Biopsy

- The preferred biopsy technique for all pigmented lesions and lesions suspicious for or suggestive of melanoma is the excisional biopsy
- Full-thickness excisional biopsy of suspicious lesions with 1–3 mm margin of normal skin and part of subcutaneous fat should be performed whenever possible - Specimen should be removed to the level of subcutaneous fat to allow for proper staging if it is a melanoma
  ➡ Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)
- Lymphatic mapping with SLNB is the standard clinicopathological approach to evaluate LNs in patients without clinical evidence of lymph node involvement
- +ve SLNB should be followed by selective lymph node dissection

195

VI. **Treatment**

1. Medical treatment
   ➡Checkpoint inhibitors\*

- CTLA-4 inhibitor (Anti-Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated-4 antibody)
  - CTLA-4 is thought to function as a dominant "off-switch" broadly shutting down T-cell activity to prevent autoimmunity
  - Example: Ipilimumab
- Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibodies
  - Example: Pembrolizumab/ Nivolumab
    ➡ Cytokines
- Interferon-a (IFN-α)
  - Prior to development of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy high-dose IFN-a is the only option for adjuvant treatment of high-risk melanoma
- Interleukin-2 (IL-2)
  - First systemic immunotherapy for treatment of advanced melanoma
  - Associated with severe and potentially life-threatening respiratory, cardiovascular and infectious complication and is REPLACED by immune checkpoint inhibitors
    ➡ Intralesional BCG therapy
- Activation of immune system
- Associated with significant toxicities including severe skin reactions and anaphylaxis

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Surgical resection with adequate margin depending on thickness of primary tumour

- Melanoma ≤ 1mm thick = Excision with 1 cm margin of normal tissues
- Melanoma 1-2 mm thick = Excision with 2 cm margin of normal tissues
- Melanoma 2-4 mm thick = Excision with 2 cm margin of normal tissues
  - NO evidence that wider margins decrease incidence of local recurrence or improve overall survival
- Melanoma > 4 mm thick = Excision with 2 cm margin of normal tissues
  - NO evidence that wider margins decrease incidence of local recurrence or improve overall survival
    ➡ Lymph node dissection
- Completion LN dissection for +ve SLNB

VII. **Prognosis**

1. Prognostic factors
   ➡Tumour thickness

- Single **MOST** important determinant of prognosis
  - T1 stage (< 1 mm): 10-year survival rate = 92%
  - T2 stage (1-2 mm): 10-year survival rate = 80%
  - T3 stage (2-4 mm): 10-year survival rate = 63%
  - T4 stage: (> 4 mm): 10-year survival rate = 50%
- Breslow's classification of depth of invasion
  - Thickness < 0.75 mm = Good prognosis
  - Thickness 0.75-1.5 mm = Increased metastatic potential
  - Thickness > 1.5 mm = Highest risk of regional LN involvement + Poor prognosis
    ➡Histological ulceration
    ➡ Mitotic rate
    ➡Presence of lymphovascular invasion
    ➡Presence of perineural invasion

II. Etiology

1. Differential diagnosis of neck mass

[Detailed anatomical drawing of the neck and upper chest, illustrating different types of branchial cleft cysts. The drawing highlights the First branchial cleft cyst (Type I and Type II), Second branchial cleft cyst, and Third branchial cleft cyst. Key anatomical structures, including the Internal carotid artery, External carotid artery, Superior laryngeal nerve (X), and Sternocleidomastoid muscle, are labeled. The cysts are positioned along the neck region with different locations and associations to surrounding structures, offering a visual guide to their anatomical relations.]

**Congenital neck mass**

**Brachial cleft cyst** ➡ General features

- Accounts for 20% of pediatric neck mass
- Presents in late childhood or early adulthood when a previously unrecognized cyst becomes infected
- Recurrent infections of branchial cyst can occur - Development of fistula tract to the skin - Pharyngeal edema leading to airway and swallowing disorders
  ➡ 1st branchial cleft cyst (<1%)
- Type I: Duplication anomalies of external auditory canal and pass through parotid gland in close proximity to facial nerve
- Type II: Pass through parotid gland medial or lateral to facial nerve and either inferior to external auditory canal or at the bony cartilaginous junction of external auditory canal
  ➡ 2nd branchial cleft cyst (**most common**)
- Presents inferior to angle of mandible and anterior to SCM
- Sinus tract of a 2nd branchial cleft cyst will travel through deep structures of neck and open into tonsillar fossa
  ➡ 3rd branchial cleft cyst
- Presents lower in the neck and anterior to SCM
- Ends in the pharynx at the thyrohyoid membrane or pyriform sinus

**Thyroglossal duct cyst** ➡ General features

- Cysts of epithelial remnants of thyroglossal tract
- Presents as a midline mass in the anterior neck at the level of thyrohyoid membrane associated with hyoid bone
- Classically moves with swallowing and protrusion of tongue
- Often asymptomatic until being infected in the setting of URTI
  ➡ Management
- Sistrunk treatment
  - Excision of cyst and tract which often passes through central portion of hyoid bone to base of tongue

206

5. Pathological tests
   ➡Fine needle aspiration (FNA)

- Direct palpation or under ultrasound or CT guidance
- Aspirate is used for cytological analysis, PCR testing for virus
  - EBV for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)
  - HPV for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
- Does **NOT** provide material for tissue architecture or immunohistochemical analysis
  ➡ Biopsy
- Core needle biopsy
- Incisional and excisional biopsy
  - Discouraged since it can adversely affect success of subsequent surgical resection by field contamination in certain malignancy
  - Considered in the setting when FNA or core needle biopsy is being positive for lymphoma where additional tissue is required for subtyping

2. Differential diagnosis of facial nerve palsy
   ➡Guillain-Barre syndrome

- Occurs in > 50% of GBS patients
- Typically bilateral and symmetrical involvement
  ➡Sarcoidosis
- Cranial neuropathy including peripheral facial nerve palsy is a frequent manifestation of neurosarcoidosis
  ➡Lyme disease
- Tick-borne illness caused by three pathogenic species of spirochete Borrelia
- Facial nerve palsy is the most common cranial neuropathy associated with Lyme disease

[^1]: Image of an asterisk.

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Facial paralysis

- Eyebrow sagging
- Inability to close the eyes
- Drooping at the affected corner of mouth
- Disappearance of nasolabial fold
  ➡ Dry eyes and mouth
- ↓ Tearing and salivary secretion
  ➡ Hyperacusis
  ➡ Loss of taste sensation on anterior 2/3 of tongue

2. Clinical course of Bell's palsy
   ➡ Acute onset over 1 - 2 days
   ➡ Progressive course reaching maximal clinical weakness within 3 weeks
   ➡ Recovery or some degree of function is present within 6 months

VI. **Diagnosis**

1. Physical examination
   ➡ Testing for facial muscles

- Elevation of eyebrows → Frontalis
- Closing the eyes → Orbicularis oculi
- Showing the teeth → Levator anguli oris
- Puckering the lips → Orbicularis oris
- Tensing soft tissue of neck → Platysma
  ➡ Distinguishing upper and lower motor neuron lesion
- UMN lesion
  - Sparing of the upper face (forehead) muscles of the affected side indicates central lesion due to bilateral innervation to this area
  - Exception: Partial lesion of facial nerve at pes anserinus (between deep and superficial lobes of parotid gland) spares the temporal branch to frontalis muscle
- LMN lesion - Involvement of both upper and lower face indicates peripheral lesion to the ipsilateral facial nerve - Exception: Central brainstem lesion the involves the ipsilateral facial nerve nucleus or facial nerve tract in the pons
  ➡ Localization of lesions
- Tests that attempts to localize the site of lesion include Schirmer test for lacrimation, stapedial reflux and evaluation of taste and salivation
  - Only has moderate accuracy and of little practical benefit
  - Only a limited amount of patients have lesions distal to the geniculate ganglion in which these tests target at

212

2. Radiological tests
   ➡Electromyography (EMG)

- Needle electrode is inserted into muscle and recording are made during rest and voluntary muscle contraction
- Interpretation - Normal: Biphasic or triphasic potential - 10 days - 21 days post-injury: Fibrillation potential - 6 – 12 weeks before recovery: Polyphasic reinnervation potential (earliest evidence of nerve recovery)
  ➡Nerve conduction studies (NCS)
- Technique
  - Facial nerve is supramaximally stimulated near the parotid gland
  - Evoked potential is measured by surface recording electrodes over orbicularis oculi, nasalis or lower facial muscles
  - Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) that is yielded reflects activity in the muscles beneath the electrodes and corresponds histologically with the number of degenerating motor neurons
  - Amplitude of CMAP on the paralyzed side is compared with that on the normal side to determine the degree of axonal loss at 10 days after onset of symptoms
- Interpretation - CMAP value of 10% of normal corresponds with a degeneration or loss of 90% of motor axons on that side - 90% degeneration is considered to be a critical cutoff value below which recovery is poor and surgical decompression should be considered
  ➡CT with contrast
- Indicated when physical signs are atypical, slow progression beyond 3 weeks or no improvement beyond 4 months
- Imaging of the brain, temporal bone and parotid gland
- Excellent for bony details and able to demonstrate bony erosion
  ➡MRI with contrast
- Indicated when physical signs are atypical, slow progression beyond 3 weeks or no improvement beyond 4 months
- Imaging of the brain, temporal bone and parotid gland
- Delineates soft tissue structures which is best to evaluate intraparotid facial nerve for inflammation, edema or neoplasm

213

VII. Treatment

1. Non-pharmacological therapy
   ➡ Eyecare

- Cornea is at risk due to poor eyelid closure and reduced tearing which may result in drying and abrasions
- Protective measures include artificial tear, protective glasses or googles
  ➡Physical therapy
- Facial nerve physiotherapy and exercise, mime therapy, massage, electrical stimulation, acupuncture, heat therapy and combinations

2. Medical treatment
   ➡Glucocorticoids

- Early treatment with oral glucocorticoids for all patients with Bell's palsy or facial nerve palsy of suspected viral etiology
- Example: Prednisone
  ➡ Antivirals
- Combined antiviral therapy with glucocorticoids may improve outcomes particularly for subgroup of patients with severe facial palsy
- Example: Valacyclovir

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡Surgical decompression

- Surgical decompression is advocated although not currently recommended in patients with motor NCS showing > 90% degeneration of facial nerve
- Should **NOT** be undertaken if facial paralysis has been presented for 14 days or more since severe degeneration of facial nerve is probably irreversible after 2 - 3 weeks
- Indications - Middle ear infection - Traumatic cause - Iatrogenic injury during middle ear or parotid surgery
  ➡Surgery for eyecare
- Gold weight implantation into upper eyelid
- Tarsorrhaphy - Indicated for corneal protection - Poor cosmetic outcomes

# ENT Diseases

## Benign conditions of larynx

I. **Vocal cord polyps and nodules**

1. Overview
   ➡Polyp and nodules of vocal folds are manifestations of chronic vocal fold irritation

- **Polyp** tend to be unilateral
- Contralateral smaller "contact lesion" is often seen which arises from damage to opposing vocal fold in the setting of repeated contact against the primary lesion
- Occurs rarely in chilren
- **Nodules** tend to be bilateral and appear relatively symmetrical
- Also known as "singer's" or "screamer's" nodes since it is frequently seen in the setting of vocal abuse that cause inflammatory reaction with fibrotic healing
- Early nodule is edematous and becomes thickened and fibrotic with ongoing vocal fold microtrauma
- More common in females and children
- Can be accompanied by other lesions including hematoma, hemorrhage or vascular varices

| Laterality | **Polyp**                                                                        | **Nodules**                                                                        |

2. Etiology
   ➡ Smoking
   ➡ Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
   ➡ Muscle tension dysphonia
3. Clinical manifestation
   ➡ Vocal cord **polyps**

- Hoarseness
- Diplophonia (2 different voice tones at the same time)
- Raspiness and breathiness
  ➡ Vocal cord **nodules**
- Small lesion = Mild raspiness and roughness of voice
- Large lesion = Breathiness due to incomplete closure of vocal folds

[Image of the number 215 at the bottom right of the page]

II. **Vocal cord palsy**

1. **Unilateral vocal cord palsy**
   ➡ General features

- Unilateral vocal cord palsy causes the affected vocal fold to rest in the partially lateralized or paramedian position
- Contralateral vocal fold may or may not compensate to provide adequate closure during phonation
- Left vocal cord is more commonly affected due to its longer course or recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) on left side which extends into thoracic cavity - Left = Hooks around the aortic arch - Right = Hooks around the subclavian artery
  ➡ Clinical manifestation
- **Phonation:** Inadequate closure with residual glottic gap will result in air escape with a weak breathy voice secondary to a leak-valve phenomenon
- **Aspiration:** Glottal incompetence and diminished supraglottic sensation increases risk of aspiration particularly with thin liquids
- **Airway:** Glottic airway is usually adequate and airway complaints are rare
  ➡ Etiology
- **Malignancy** (invasion to vagus nerve or RLN)
  - CA thyroid
  - CA lung
  - CA esophagus
- **Degenerative**
  - Stroke
  - Myasthenia gravis
  - Poliomyelitis
  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
  - Arnold-Chiari malformation (pediatric population)
- **Trauma**
  - Neck/ Chest/ Laryngeal trauma
- **Iatrogenic**
  - Thyroid and parathyroid surgery/ Cardiothoracic surgery/ Carotid endarterectomy/ Anterior cervical approach to cervical spine or disk surgery
  - Endotracheal intubation
  - Post-chemoradiation
- **Idiopathic**
  ➡ Diagnosis
- Flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy
- Laryngeal EMG
  - Distinguish between vocal cord paralysis from mechanical fixation secondary to scar tissue or cricoarytenoid joint fixation

216

➡Management

- Speech therapy
  - Promote glottic closure to optimize voice and prevent aspiration
  - Some patients do well this modality alone
- Augmentation (medialization) of vocal cord - Medialization thyroplasty - Laryngeal framework surgery - Transcervical placement of an implant (silicone or Gore-Tex) through a surgically created window in the thyroid cartilage - Can be combined with arytenoid repositioning with procedures to adduct the vocal process of arytenoids - Injection laryngoplasty - Vocal fold injection to increase the bulk and provide a surface against which the contralateral normal fold may contact to optimize closure - Injection agents include autologous (fat, collagen) or alloplastic (hyaluronic acid, hydroxyapatite, micronized cadaveric human collagen) - Laryngeal reinnervation - Performed with varying degrees of success
  217

2. Bilateral vocal cord palsy
   ➡General features

- Bilateral denervated vocal folds may be positioned near the midline with a narrow glottic aperture
  ➡Clinical manifestation
- Phonation: Voice is usually good with this glottic configuration
- Airway: Airway compromise is more common which ranges from minimal dyspnea or inspiratory stridor to severe respiratory distress
  ➡Etiology (majority of bilateral vocal fold paralysis is _iatrogenic_)
- **Malignancy** (invasion to vagus nerve or RLN)
  - CA thyroid
  - CA lung
  - CA esophagus
- **Degenerative**
  - Stroke
  - Myasthenia gravis
  - Poliomyelitis
  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
  - Arnold-Chiari malformation (_pediatric population_)
- **Trauma**
  - Neck/Chest/Laryngeal trauma
- **Iatrogenic**
  - Thyroid and parathyroid surgery/Cardiothoracic surgery/ Carotid endarterectomy/Anterior cervical approach to cervical spine or disk surgery
  - Endotracheal intubation
  - Post-chemoradiation
- **Idiopathic**
  ➡Management
- Tracheostomy\*
  - Cords are often paralyzed in a paramedian position creating airway compromise that necessitates a tracheostomy
- Lateralization of vocal cord
- Arytenoidectomy
- Laryngeal reinnervation

III. Polypoid corditis (Reinke's edema)

1. General features
   ➡Viscous material accumulates in the superficial lamina propria (Reinke's space) of the true vocal
   folds as a result of chronic irritation and inflammation

- Edema is thought to arise from injury to the capillary that exist in this layer with
  subsequent extravasation of fluid
  ➡Vocal folds appear swollen and floppy and findings are typically bilateral
  ➡Frequently seen in middle-aged females

2. Etiology

IV. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP)

1. General features
   ➡ **MOST** common benign laryngeal tumours in children
   ➡Typically diagnosed between age 2-3 and most diagnosed before age of 5

- Mostly resolves after puberty but disorder may progress into adulthood
- Adult-onset RRP occurs in 30-40s and is usually less severe and more likely to involve
  extra-laryngeal sites of upper aerodigestive tract
  ➡Reflects involvement of HPV within the mucosal epithelium in the upper aerodigestive tract
  secondary to viral acquisition during vaginal delivery
- Larynx is most commonly involved
- HPV subtype 6 and 11 are most often implicated

2. Clinical manifestation
   ➡Hoarseness
   ➡Breathiness
   ➡Respiratory distress
3. Management
   ➡Tracheostomy
   ➡ Microlaryngeal surgery with excision or laser ablation

- **NO** cure for the disease and surgery has an ongoing role of palliation
- Most children with RRP requires multiple surgical treatment before puberty and the
  natural history is eventual recurrence

III. **Pathophysiology**

1. Anatomy of the parotid gland

[Detailed illustration of the right side of a human face, showcasing the anatomy of the parotid gland and surrounding structures. The parotid gland, a large salivary gland, is prominently featured, with labels pointing to its various parts. The facial nerve is depicted emerging from the stylomastoid foramen, branching into temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, and cervical branches. Other anatomical features include the posterior auricular nerve, the nerve to the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, and the stylohyoid muscle. The parotid duct (of Stensen) is also visible. Below the facial illustration, there is a horizontal cross-section showing the trunk of the facial nerve within the mastoid process, along with the medial pterygoid muscle, ramus of the mandible, masseter muscle, and the parotid gland.]

➡Anatomical location of parotid gland

- Anterior to the external auditory canal
- Superior to angle of mandible
- Inferior to zygomatic arch
- (Majority) Superficial to the masseter muscle
- Differentiation between superficial and deep lobe - Imaginary line from mandible to mastoid tip (_above_: superficial; _below_: deep) - Retromandibular vein (_above_: superficial; _below_: deep)
  ➡ Stensen’s duct
- Arise from anterior border of parotid gland which is 4 – 7 cm long
- Opening is opposite to the upper 2nd molar

2. Pathogenesis
   ➡ Ductal obstruction by calculi or tumour leads to salivary stasis
   ➡ Permits retrograde seeding of the Stensen’s duct by a mixed oral flora
   ➡ Leads to acute bacterial suppurative parotitis

- May be complicated by abscess formation resulting from contiguous infection or hematogenous seeding to the intraparotid or periparotid lymph nodes

221

IV. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Facial swelling

- Sudden onset of firm erythematous swelling
- Involves the preauricular and postauricular region extending to the angle of mandible
  ➡ Facial pain
- Associated with exquisite local pain and tenderness
  ➡ Trismus
  ➡ Dysphagia
  ➡Fever and chills
  ➡Generalized toxicity

2. Clinical course
   ➡Viral parotitis is distinguished from suppurative parotitis by a prodromal period followed by
   acute swelling of the involved gland

- Last for 5-10 days and is often bilateral
- Does NOT give a purulent discharge from Stensen's duct
  V. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡Examination of oral cavity

- Purulent material may be expressed from orifice of Stensen's duct

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡Serum amylase

- Elevated serum amylase in the absence of pancreatitis supports the clinical suspicion of parotid gland involvement
  ➡Gram smear and culture
- Fine needle aspiration of swollen parotid gland extra-orally is the best method to identify causative organisms
- Purulent drainage from the Stensen's duct should be collected for Gram stain and culture
  - Culture obtained from oral cavity should be interpreted with caution since the results may represent contamination by oral flora

222

VI. **Treatment**

1. Medical treatment
   ➡Antibiotics

- Total duration = 10 – 14 days
- Immunocompetent host
  - Nafcillin (OR) 1st generation cephalosporin (PLUS)
  - Clindamycin (OR) Metronidazole
- Immunocompromised host
  - Vancomycin (OR) linezolid (PLUS)
  - Cefepime (OR) Imipenem (OR) Meropenem (OR) Piperacillin-tazobactam

2. Surgical treatment

## Sialolithiasis

I. **Overview**

1. General features
   - Sialolithiasis refers to the presence of stones or calculi in salivary glands or ducts
   - Sialoadenitis refers to inflammation of salivary glands which is commonly caused by sialolithiasis and autoimmune disease (e.g. Sjogren's syndrome)
   - All parotid, submandibular, sublingual and minor salivary glands are subjected to the development of stones
     - Salivary gland stones occurs **MOST** frequently from submandibular glands and tends to be the largest and most often located in the duct
       - Submandibular duct is long and large
       - Flow of saliva is slow and against gravity
       - Saliva is more alkaline with a high mucin and Ca2+ content
     - Parotid gland stones occurs accounts for 6 – 20% of cases and tends to be smaller, multiple and located within the gland itself

II. **Epidemiology**

1. General epidemiology
   - Female predominance
   - Occurs in individuals between ages 30 – 60 years

III. **Etiology**

1. Risk factors
   - Medication history
     - Dehydration
     - Hypercalcemia

     - Anticholinergics
     - Diuretics
   - Social history
     - Smoking
     - Trauma

224

IV. **Pathogenesis**

1. Anatomy of salivary glands and ducts

[Drawing of the Anatomy of the salivary glands and ducts. On the left is an image of a mouth open, with the tongue pulled up to display the salivary glands and ducts. The submandibular duct is labeled as originating on the floor of the mouth near the base of the tongue and running upwards, connecting to the submandibular gland. The sublingual gland is labeled below the submandibular duct. The sublingual caruncle with opening of submandibular duct (Wharton's duct) is labeled as originating on the floor of the mouth near the base of the tongue and running upwards. On the right is an image of a person's mouth with an instrument holding the cheek open. The parotid papilla with opening of parotid duct (Stensen's duct) is labeled, indicating its location on the inside of the cheek.]

➡ Stensen's duct

- Opening of parotid duct
- Arise from anterior border of parotid gland which is 4 - 7 cm long
- Opening is opposite to the upper 2nd molar
  ➡ Wharton's duct
- Opening of submandibular duct
- Located on the floor of mouth near the frenulum of the tongue

2. Pathogenesis
   ➡ Stagnation of saliva that is rich in Ca2+ in the setting of a partial obstruction

- Leading to the formation of salivary stones which are composed largely of calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite
  ➡ Chronic obstruction
- Complete obstruction of salivary gland outflow will lead to persistent swelling of glands
- Swelling will eventually regress as the obstruction results in the glands ceasing to produce saliva
- Salivary gland will then feel to be firm and mistaken to be a focal mass with patient being asymptomatic without the need for intervention

225

V. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms of sialolithiasis
   ➡Pain and swelling of glands

- Aggravated by eating or with anticipation of eating
- Waxing and waning symptoms of episodic swelling and discomfort
- 30% of patients with submandibular sialolithiasis present with painless swelling

2. Signs and symptoms of sialoadenitis
   ➡Fever and chills

- Pain, swelling and erythema of glands
- Lack of improvement or focal worsening within the gland despite antibiotics for 7 - 10 days suggests possibility of abscess formation
- Drainage of pus from salivary duct

3. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Acute bacterial sialadenitis

- Acute suppurative sialadenitis in the absence of sialolithiasis is a condition that typically affects older adults, malnourished or post-operative patients
- Common caused by S. aureus but S. viridans, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Bacteroides species have also been isolated
- Characterized by sudden onset of a very firm and tender swelling of involved gland
- Fever and chills are present with fairly marked systemic toxicity
- Purulent discharge can be expressed from the affected duct orifice
  ➡Chronic bacterial sialadenitis
- Low-grade chronic infection that eventually lead to destruction of salivary gland
- Occurs more commonly in patients with decreased salivary secretion and increased mucus content in the saliva
- Predisposing factors include stones, structures and trauma
  ➡Viral sialadenitis
- Commonly caused by mumps virus leading to acute pain and swelling of one or both parotid glands
- Associated with non-specific prodrome consisting of low-grade fever, malaise, headache, myalgia and anorexia
- Salivary gland tumours
- The smaller the salivary gland in adults the higher the probability that a neoplasm arising in a gland is malignant as a general rule
  ➡Sjogren's syndrome
- Chronic inflammatory disorder characterized primarily by diminished lacrimal and salivary gland secretions resulting in symptoms of dry eyes and mouth (sicca complex)
- Presents with a gradual swelling of parotid or submandibular glands typically bilaterally
- Autoimmune sialadenitis causes parenchymal destruction and dilation of intraglandular ducts
  ➡Sarcoidosis
- Extrapulmonary sarcoidosis affecting salivary glands
- Characterized by bilateral painless parotid enlargement due to granulomatous infiltration

[Image: The image shows the number 226 at the bottom right corner of the page.]

VI. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡ Examination of salivary glands and ducts

- Salivary glands itself should be spongy and elastic but in the presence of sialolithiasis the glands may be tender particular in the presence of associated infection
- Normally clear saliva should be seen flowing from the duct when the respective gland is compressed
- Small stones may be visible at the duct orifice and seen to be intermittently obstructing the duct moving in and out of view with compression of glands
- Stones are typically rock hard, small, smooth or irregular mostly felt within ductal system
- Examination of Stensen's duct
  - Palpation of the buccal mucosa around the orifice of Stensen's duct
  - Palpate the face along the duct's route by starting at the attachment of earlobe and palpating forward in the direction of the jaw-line with one hand on the outside and the other hand inside the mouth
- Examination of Wharton's duct
  - Palpation of the floor of mouth in a posterior to anterior direction
  - Having the patient close his or her mouth slightly to relax the musculature on the floor of mouth will facilitate examination

2. Radiological tests
   ➡ Sialography

- Duct is cannulated and a radiopaque dye is injected followed by plain films
- Facilitate a diagnosis other than sialolithiasis such as stricture, sialectasis and cystic degeneration of duct and gland
- Largely supplanted by high-resolution CT scan and ultrasound
- Contraindicated in patients with acute sialadenitis or contrast allergy
  ➡Ultrasound
- > 90% of stones 2 mm in diameter or larger can be detected by ultrasound
- Better assess periglandular structures and less invasive than sialography
- Confirm the origin of mass from parotid or submandibular gland
- Differentiate mass from stones and lymph nodes
- Able to detect radiolucent stones or radiopaque stones that are superimposed on bone and thus undetectable on conventional radiographs
  ➡ X-ray
- Effective in detection of radiopaque stones - Submandibular calculi tends to be radiopaque in 80 – 95% of cases - Ο Parotid calculi tends to be radiopaque in 60% of cases
  ➡CT scan
- Imaging modality of choice for evaluation of salivary stones
- Most stones contain enough Ca2+ to be visible with non-contrast imaging
  ➡X MRI scan
- Standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will not visualize stones

227

VII. Treatment

1. Non-pharmacological approach
   ➡Adequate hydration
   ➡Apply moist heat to involved area
   ➡Massaging the gland
   ➡Milking the duct
   ➡Sialogogues to promote ductal secretions

- Sialogogues examples include tart hard candies such as lemon drops
- Used throughout the day as often as tolerated by patients

2. Medical treatment
   ➡ NSAIDS

- Analgesics and decrease inflammation
- Example: Ibuprofen
  ➡Antibiotics
- Indicated if superinfection is suspected from increasing pain, fever or purulent discharge from the salivary duct
- Anti-staphylococcal antibiotics including dicloxacillin and cephalexin should be administered

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡Surgical intervention

- Submandibular stones can be removed by a transoral approach
- Stones that are palpable within the mouth are generally amenable to this procedure
- Care must be taken to avoid excess trauma to the duct and associated sublingual glands to avoid formation of ranula which is a retention cyst on floor of mouth
  ➡ Extracorporeal lithotripsy
- Indicated in patients whom a simple transoral surgical approach is not possible or fails typically stones located in proximal ducts or in salivary glands themselves
- Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is effective for intraductal stone and < 7 mm
  ➡Laser lithotripsy
- Performed via an endoscope to allow fragmentation of stones prior to endoscopic removal
  ➡Sialoendoscopy with stone removal
- Sialoendoscopy may be utilized to visualize the ductal anatomy and to remove small stones that are beyond the reach of traditional transoral surgical procedures
- Find stones that have gone undetected by other imaging technique
- Can also be performed after traditional transoral calculus removal to check for presence of residual stone fragments
  VIII. Complications

1. Complications of sialolithiasis
   ➡ Superimposed infection

- Leads to secondary infection as a result of ductal obstruction and stasis
  ➡Abscess formation
- Potentially compromise the airways

   ➡Pleomorphic adenoma
   - **MOST** common benign salivary gland tumour
   - **MOST** frequently occurs in the parotid gland but may also arise in other salivary glands especially in the palate
   - Clinically important as they may give rise to malignant tumours
     ➡Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma
   - Malignant tumour that coexist or arise from a pre-existing pleomorphic adenoma
   - Manifested by sudden growth of a previously stable mass in a salivary gland usually the parotid gland
   - Prognosis depends upon the extent of invasion, grade, tumour size and lymph node status
     ➡ Warthin's tumour
   - Accounts for 6 – 10% of parotid tumour
   - Tendency for multifocality and bilaterality (10%)
   - Presents as slow-growing painless mass
     [Image Description: The number 231 is located at the bottom right corner of the page.]

2. Malignant tumours
   ➡ Mucoepidermoid carcinoma

- **MOST** common malignant salivary gland tumour
- **MOST** common parotid gland malignancy
- Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma is typically cystic, slow growing and without pain
- High-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma is typically solid, rapidly enlarging with or without pain
  ➡Adenoid cystic carcinoma
- 2nd most common malignant salivary gland tumour

- Tumour is locally aggressive with recurrence arising after many years - Propensity for perineural invasion and distant metastasis
  ➡Acinic cell carcinoma
- 2nd most common parotid gland malignancy
- Exhibits low-grade behavior and associated with a favourable long-term prognosis
  ➡Squamous cell carcinoma
- SCC may occur in salivary glands primarily parotid or submandibular glands
- True primary SCC are very rare and are regarded as diagnosis of exclusion
- Majority of SCC are metastatic from a cutaneous (skin) or oral primary SCC

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Salivary gland mass or swelling
   ➡Mucosal ulceration
   ➡Pain and paresthesia
   ➡Facial weakness

- High suspicion of malignant involvement of parotid gland
- Parotid tumour must be distinguished from Bell's palsy

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Salivary cysts
   ➡Salivary gland stones
   ➡Sjogren's syndrome
   ➡Metastasis from other tumours
   ➡Lymphoepithelial cysts
   ➡Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis (Kuttner's tumour)
   ➡Regional lymphadenopathy

3. Differential diagnosis of bilateral parotid gland
   ➡ Parotitis
   ➡Bruxism (Excess teeth grinding or jaw clenching)
   ➡Masseter hypertrophy
   ➡Sialadenosis

  ➡Drug-induced (e.g. Phenytoin)
  [Image of the number 232 in the bottom right corner of the image]

VI. Diagnosis

1. History taking
   ➡History of presenting illness (HPI)

- Duration of presence of mass
- Rapidity and progression of growth
- Associated symptoms
  - Pain and paresthesia
  - Facial muscle paralysis
    ➡Medical history
- Previous skin cancer (e.g. SCC)
- Melanoma of scalp or facial region
  ➡ Drug history
- Radiotherapy
  ➡Social history
- Smoking

2. Physical examination
   ➡H&N examination

- Size/ Tenderness/ Mobility/ Fixation to skin or underlying structures
- Limitation in jaw opening
- Pharyngeal asymmetry
- Buccal involvement
- Cervical lymphadenopathy
  ➡Facial nerve examination
- Document specific branch involvement if present

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡Fine need aspiration (FNA) cytology or core needle biopsy

- FNA for cytology can usually discriminate benign tumours from malignant tumours and metastasis but is less specific in the exact type of tumour
- Tissue diagnosis is required to make the diagnosis of a salivary gland tumour prior to definitive treatment whenever possible to avoid major surgery for a benign tumour or a lymphoma
- Core needle biopsy has risks of bleeding, nerve injury and tumour seedling
  [Image of a page number '233' at the bottom right corner of the page.]

4. Radiological tests
   ➡ Ultrasound

- Provides tissue characterization while being timely and cost-effective for imaging of parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands
- Facilitate fine needle aspiration (FNA) and core needle biopsy
  ➡ CT scan
- General features
  - Assess the extent of salivary gland tumour
  - Assess pharyngeal space for involvement from lesions in parotid
  - Evaluate for local extension and bony or perineural invasion
  - Detects lymph node and distant metastasis
  - Provides anatomical details for surgical planning
- Advantages - Temporal bone or mandibular destruction is best identified by CT scan
  ➡ MRI scan
- General features
  - Assess the extent of salivary gland tumour
  - Assess pharyngeal space for involvement from lesions in parotid
  - Evaluate for local extension and bony or perineural invasion
  - Detects lymph node and distant metastasis
  - Provides anatomical details for surgical planning
- Advantages - Detailed evaluation of soft tissue infiltration, perineural invasion and intracranial extension
  ➡ PET-scan
- Evaluate for lymph node and distant metastasis

234

VII. Treatment

1. Medical treatment
   ➡ Radiotherapy

- Definitive radiotherapy is reserved for patients who are medically inoperable or who have unresectable disease
  - Unresectable disease either by extent of tumour invasion or location such that resection would result in a significant functional or cosmetic deficit

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Complete surgical resection is cornerstone of treatment when it can be achieved with negative surgical margins

- Patients with benign tumours or low-grade malignancy are treated with surgery alone
- Patients with high-grade malignancy and those with positive margins post-surgery or other high risk features are treatment with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy
  ➡ Complications
- Facial nerve injury
- Frey syndrome
  - Also known as auriculotemporal syndrome or gustatory sweating
  - Characterized by sweating and flushing of facial skin over parotid bed and neck during mastication
  - Result of aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibers between the otic ganglion and salivary tissues which leads to innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous vessels

# H&N Diseases

## Head and neck (H&N) cancer

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Most H&N cancer begins in the mucosal surfaces of upper aerodigestive tract which are predominantly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
   ➡ Arises from 5 anatomical areas including oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, nasal cavity & paranasal sinuses and salivary glands
   ➡ **ALWAYS** protect the airway for all H&N cancer

2. Concept of field cancerization
   ➡ Diffuse and chronic exposure of mucosa of upper aerodigestive tract to carcinogenic substance leads to widespread changes in mucosal epithelium
   ➡ Leads to development of separate tumours at different anatomical sites

- Increased risk of synchronous or metachronous tumour
  - Synchronous tumour = Second primary tumour detected **within 6 months**
  - Metachronous tumour = Second primary tumour detected **> 6 months**
- Patients who develop tumour in the oral cavity and the oropharynx are more likely to develop a second primary tumour in the upper esophagus
- Patients who develop tumour in the larynx are more likely to develop as secondary primary tumour in the lung
  ➡ Panendoscopy is always recommended
- Panendoscopy includes direct laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy and OGD
- Staging examination is recommended at the initial evaluation of all patients with primary cancers of upper aerodigestive tract

[Image Description: The page contains the words "H&N Diseases", "Head and neck (H&N) cancer", "Overview", "General features", "Concept of field cancerization" written in black bold letters. The document also includes some bullet points, indents and arrow symbols.]

237

II. Etiology

1. Causes of H&N cancers
   ➡ Smoking

- Tumours from non-smokers present more frequently in oral cavity especially anterior
  tongue, buccal mucosa and alveolar ridge
- Tumours from smokers present more frequently in the floor of the mouth, hypopharynx
  and larynx
  ➡ Alcoholism
  ➡ HPV infection
- HPV Type 16 and 18
- HPV-associated H&N cancer occur primarily in the oropharynx including tonsils and the
  base of tongue
- HPV infection can induce two viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 which inactivate tumour
  suppressor 53 and Rb leading to tumor promotion
- Presents in young male patients who have a higher lifetime number of sexual partners and
  oral sex
- Define a distinct subset of patients compared with HPV negative tobacco or alcohol-
  driven oropharynx cancer with following features - Frequent LN metastasis - Higher response rate to induction chemotherapy - Better prognosis - Deintensification of treatment can be considered while obtaining the same
  locoregional and overall survival seen with standard treatment options
  ➡ Environmental UV light exposure
  ➡ Radiation exposure
  ➡ Betel nut chewing

III. Pathophysiology

[Anatomical illustration of the head and neck region in sagittal view. The illustration is labeled with various anatomical structures including the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, oral cavity, tongue, salivary glands, larynx, trachea, esophagus, parotid gland, nasopharynx, oropharynx, epiglottis, hypopharynx, and pharynx. These structures are highlighted in different colors to differentiate them.]

IV. **Pathogenesis**

1. TNM staging
   - Staging for upper aerodigestive tract malignancy by AJCC follows TNM staging format
   - T stage for each site varies upon the relevant anatomy
   - N stage is uniform for all H&N cancer except for the nasopharynx
   - M stage is uniform for all H&N cancer

|     |                                                                                              |
| :-- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     | **N criteria**                                                                               |
| NX  | ➡ Regional LN cannot be assessed                                                             |
| N0  | ➡ No regional LN metastasis                                                                  |
| N1  | ➡ Metastasis in single ipsilateral LN < 3 cm in greatest dimension and ENE -                 |
| N2a | ➡ Metastasis in single ipsilateral LN < 3 cm in greatest dimension and ENE + (OR)            |
| N2b | ➡ Metastasis in single ipsilateral LN > 3 cm but < 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE -      |
| N2c | ➡ Metastasis in multiple ipsilateral LN but all < 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE -       |
|     | ➡ Metastasis in bilateral or contralateral LN but all < 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE - |

Remarks: ENE = Extranodal extension
[Image Description: This is an image of the TNM staging criteria in a table format. The table is divided into two parts: N criteria and M criteria. N criteria includes NX, N0, N1, N2a, N2b, N2c, N3a, and N3b, each with a corresponding description of metastasis status based on lymph node size and location. M criteria includes M0 and M1, describing the presence or absence of distant metastasis. At the bottom, there is a remark explaining that ENE stands for Extranodal extension.]

V. **Diagnosis**

1. Biochemical tests

- Fine needle aspiration (FNA) or biopsy
  - Can make an initial tissue diagnosis when patient presents with a neck mass (metastatic cervical lymph node) without an obvious primary mucosal or upper aerodigestive tract
  - FNA and biopsy of a suspected LN in the setting of established primary tumour may provide relevant information when clinical and imaging evaluation of neck LNs is equivocal and a positive or negative finding will change the treatment approach

2. Radiological tests

- CT scan
  - Primary sites
    - Determine extent of tumour infiltration into deep tongue musculature and whether mandible is involved for cancer of the oral cavity
    - Determine local invasion or infiltration into adjacent structures for other H&N cancers that is difficult to detect on physical examination
  - Regional LNs
    - CT evaluation of regional LNs depend on the size and the appearance of LNs to differentiate involved from uninvolved LNs
    - Features of pathological LNs
      - Size > 1.0 cm in minimal axial diameter
      - Rounded-shaped
      - Increased or heterogeneous contrast enhancement
      - Loss of normal fatty hilum
      - Presence of central necrosis
  - CT is superior to MRI in terms of providing greater spatial resolution, faster acquisition time and better for evaluation of bony destruction
- MRI scan
  - MRI is superior to CT in terms of soft tissue delineation, detecting bone marrow invasion or skull base erosions
- Panendoscopy (Laryngoscopy + Bronchoscopy + OGD)
  - Detection of synchronous primary cancer
  - Part of operative staging for characterization of primary tumour or to look for distant disease in early stage disease
  - Panendoscopy may identify synchronous primaries that are too small to be identified with PET scan
- PET scan
  - Detection of synchronous primary cancer
  - Part of operative staging for characterization of primary tumour or to look for distant disease in early stage disease
  - PET scan may identify lower aerodigestive tract tumours not seen with panendoscopy
  - PET scan is superior to both CT and MRI for detecting regional nodal metastasis as well as distant metastasis and second primary tumorus

VI. Treatment

1. Treatment of localized (early stage) cancers (Stage I and II)
   ➡ Primary surgery

- Traditional surgical approaches through skin incision to gain access to the primary are used for salivary and thyroid cancers which are easily accessible
- Minimally-invasive technique such as transoral laser microsurgery (TOLM) for larynx and transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for oropharynx cancer improved transoral access
  ➡Definitive radiation therapy
- External beam RT
- Brachytherapy
  ➡Postoperative RT ± chemotherapy
- Indicated for patients who have close or positive margins or factors increasing risk of local recurrence including lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion and extranodal extensions (ENE)

2. Treatment of locoregional advanced (late stage) cancers (Stage III and IV)
   ➡ Combined modality approaches are generally required to optimize the chance for long-term disease control since it is associated with high risk of both local recurrence and distant metastasis
   242

# VII. Cancer of oral cavity

## 1. Cancer of the lip

➡General features

- Majority of lip cancer is diagnosed in the lower lip (**88 – 98%**) followed by the upper lip (2 – 7%) and oral commissure (1%)
- Predominant SCC but other tumours can also present in this location including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), malignant melanoma, keratoacanthoma, verrucous carcinoma and tumours of mesenchymal origin (leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma)
- LN metastasis
  - Occurs in < 10% patients and primarily to submental and submandibular lymph nodes (Level I)
    ➡Risk factors
- Prolonged exposure to sunlight\*
  - Projection of lower lip relating to sunlight exposure explains why the majority of SCC arise along the vermilion border of lower lip
- Smoking
- Immunosuppression
- Fair complexion
  ➡Clinical manifestation
- Ulcerated lesion on vermilion or cutaneous surface
- Paraesthesia in area adjacent to lesion indicates mental nerve involvement
  ➡Management
- Surgical excision + Reconstruction
  - Surgical excision with histological confirmation of tumour-free margin is the preferred treatment modality
- Lymph node dissection
  - Indicated in the presence of clinically evident neck metastasis
- Postoperative radiotherapy
  - Indicated in patients with positive margins, tumour thickness > 4 mm, perineural invasion or with LN metastasis

243

2. Cancer of tongue
   ➡ General features

- Tumours of tongue occurs most commonly on the lateral and ventral surfaces
- Primary tumours of mesenchymal components of tongue include leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and neurofibroma
  ➡ Risk factors - Premalignant lesions - Erythroplakia - Defined as bright red plaque of oral mucosa that cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically (no histological correlation) - Leukoplakia - Defined as white patch or plaque that cannot be scrapped off and characterized clinically or pathologically (no histological correlation) - Leukoplakia on the floor of the mouth has a particularly high risk of malignant transformation
  ➡ Clinical manifestation
- Exophytic growth or non-healing ulcers
- Ipsilateral paraesthesia of tongue
  - Ο Invasion of lingual nerve by locally extensive tumours
- Tongue deviation, fasciculation and atrophy - Ο Invasion of hypoglossal nerve by locally extensive tumours
  ➡ Management
- Wide local excision with either primary closure or healing by secondary intention
  - Ο Indicated in small T1 - 2 primary tumours
  - Ο CO2 ablation can be used for excision or ablation of premalignant lesions
- Partial glossectomy + Reconstruction
  - Ο Partial glossectomy removes a significant portion of lateral oral tongue but still permits a reasonably effective postoperative function
  - Ο Resection of large tumours of tongue that lead to decreased lingual contact with palate, lip and teeth will result in impaired articulation
  - Ο Reconstruction using soft pliable fasciocutaneous free flaps can provide intraoral bulk and preservation of tongue mobility
  - Ο Prosthetic augmentation can allow contact between remaining tongue tissue and palate improving ability to speak and swallow
- Lymph node dissection
  - Ο Selective neck dissection
  - Ο Modified radical neck dissection

3. Cancer of the floor of mouth
   ➡General features

- Invasion into muscular floor of mouth including genioglossus, mylohyoid and hyoglossus muscles can result in decreased tongue mobility and poor articulation
- Invasion into intrinsic muscles of the tongue
- Spread of tumours along salivary ducts resulting in direct extension into sublingual space since the ostia of sublingual and submandibular gland are contained in the floor of mouth
- Anterolateral extension to mandibular periosteum
  ➡ Diagnosis
- Bimanual palpation to assess fixation of tumour to adjacent bone is essential during physical examination
  - Absence of fixation to inner mandibular cortex indicates a mandible-sparing procedure is feasible
- X-ray (Panoramic view)/ CT/ MRI scan - Imaging studies of the mandible are helpful for ascertaining bone invasion
  ➡Management
- Wide local excision
  Ο Indicated for small mucosal lesion
  - Followed by placement of a split-thickness skin graft over the muscular bed
- Marginal or segmental mandibulectomy + Reconstruction
  - Indicated for larger defects
  - Complex reconstruction with a fasciocutaneous or vascularized osseous free flap
  - Deep invasion into intrinsic muscles of tongue causes fixation and mandates a partial glossectomy in conjunction with resection of the floor of mouth
  - Invasion into sublingual and submandibular duct require resection of these structures in continuity with primary lesion

4. Cancer of alveolus/ gingiva
   ➡General features

- Alveolar mucosa overlies the bone of mandible and maxilla
  ➡ Diagnosis
- X-ray (Panoramic view)/ CT/ MRI scan - X-ray (Panoramic view) detects gross cortical invasion
  Ο CT is the best modality for demonstrating subtle cortical invasion
  Ο MRI is the best modality for demonstrating invasion of medullary cavity of mandible
  ➡ Management
- Marginal resection of mandible is indicated for tumours that present with minimal bone invasion and the access is performed by using anterior mandibulotomy
- Segmental mandibulectomy is indicated for more extensive tumours that invade into the medullary cavity
- Treatment of lesions of alveolar mucosa frequently requires resection of the underlying bone due to tight attachment of alveolar mucosa to the mandibular and maxillary periosteum

245

5. Cancer of retromolar trigone
   ➡General features

- Retromolar trigone is represented by tissue posterior to the posterior inferior alveolar ridge and ascends over inner surface of ramus of the mandible
- Extend posteriorly into oropharyngeal anatomy or laterally to invade the mandible - Early involvement of mandible is common due to lack of intervening soft tissue in the region
  ➡Clinical manifestation
- Trismus - Involvement of muscles of mastication and may indicate spread to skull base
  ➡Management
- Resection of retromolar trigone tumours
  - Usually requires marginal or segmental mandibulectomy with a soft tissue or osseous reconstruction to maximize postoperative ability of speech and swallowing
- Ipsilateral neck dissection
  - Performed because of risk of metastasis to regional lymphatics

6. Cancer of buccal mucosa
   ➡General features

- Buccal mucosa includes all mucosal lining from inner surface of lips to line of attachment of mucosa of alveolar ridges and pterygomandibular raphe
- Propensity to spread locally and metastasize to regional lymphatics - Lymphatic drainage is to the facial and submandibular node (Level I)
  ➡ Etiology
- Lichen planus
- Chronic dental trauma
- Smoking
- Alcoholism
  ➡ Management
- Small lesions can be excised surgically
- Advanced lesions require combined surgical excision and postoperative radiotherapy
  - Local intraoral spread may necessitate resection of alveolar ridge of the mandible or maxilla
  - Reconstruction can be accomplished with a folded fasciocutaneous free flap or a combination of pedicled and free tissue technique

246

7. Cancer of hard palate
   ➡General features

- SCC and minor salivary gland tumours are the most common malignancy of palate
  ➡ Etiology
- Chronic irritating from ill-fitting dentures
- Smoking
- Alcoholism
  ➡Management
- Mucosal excision indicated and adequate for very superficial lesion
  - Periosteum of the palate act as a barrier to spread of tumour
- Partial palatectomy of infrastructure maxillectomy is required for larger lesion involving the palate or maxillary antrum
  - Involvement of palate requires removal of a portion of the bony palate
  - Through-and-through defects of palate require dental prosthesis for rehabilitation of swallowing and speech
- Postoperative radiotherapy is indicated for advanced staged tumours

# ENT Diseases

## Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC)

I. Overview

1.  General features
    ➡ Predominant tumour type arising in nasopharynx
    ➡ Frequently originates from pharyngeal recess known as fossa of Rosenmuller - Remains asymptomatic for a long period due to its presence in a clinically occult site - Patient will present with locally or regionally advanced disease due to prolonged
    asymptomatic period or due to missed diagnosis
    ➡ Tendency for early metastasis - Lymph node metastasis are usually present at diagnosis and commonly bilateral - Common sites of distant metastasis - Bone (75%) / Liver / Lung / Distant LN
    II. Epidemiology
1.  General epidemiology
    ➡ Endemic in Southern China including Hong Kong
    ➡ Rare in United States and Europe
    ➡ Male predominance (M : F = 2-3:1)
1.  Hong Kong's epidemiology
    ➡ Incidence
    - 10th cancer in terms of incidence for both sex
    - 6th cancer in terms of incidence for males

III. Etiology

1.  Risk factors
    ➡ EBV infection
    - Primary etiological agent in pathogenesis of NPC
    - Detection of EBV DNA and EBV gene expression in precursor lesion and tumour cells
    - Demonstrated serological responses to EBV gene products - IgA antibodies against EBV viral capsid antigen (EBV VCA IgA)
      ➡ Dietary habits
    - Salted fish
    - Preserved or fermented food
      - Contains high levels of nitrosamines, bacterial mutagens, direct genotoxins and
        EBV-reactivating substances
    - Cooking of salt-cured food - Release volatile nitrosamines which are carried by steam and distributed over the
      nasopharyngeal mucosa
      ➡ Genetics
    - Family history of NPC
    - Associated with certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes
    - Associated with genetic polymorphism such as CYP2A6 - CYP2A6 is a polymorphism of nitrosamine metabolizing gene
      ➡ Smoking
    - Classical risk factors for H&N cancer
      ➡ Alcoholism
    - Classical risk factors for H&N cancer

VII. Diagnosis

1. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials
   ➡ Serum ALP level
   • ↑ ALP level in bone metastasis
   ➡EBV DNA level
   • Plasma circulating EBV DNA level is detected by PCR
   • Diagnostic and staging evaluation for prognosis
   • Pre-treatment plasma EBV DNA levels correlate with outcomes
   • Post-treatment plasma EBV DNA levels evaluates treatment response and detection of recurrence
   ➡EBV serology
   • Sustained rise in IgA to both viral capsid antigen (VCA) and early antigen (EA)
   ○ ↑ EBV VCA-IgA and EBV EA-IgA
   • EBV-specific serological screening has low specificity for NPC
   • Elevated titre may precede diagnosis of NPC for a period of up to 10 years

251

2. Radiological tests
   ➡Nasopharyngoscopy

- Definitive diagnosis is made by endoscope-guided biopsy of primary tumour
- Incision nodal biopsy or nodal dissection should be avoided since it will negatively
  impact subsequent treatment
  ➡CT or MRI of nasopharynx, skull base and neck
- Assessment of locoregional disease extent
  ➡PET-CT scan
- Use of 17-fluorodeoxyglucose as contrast
- Superior ability to detect lymph node and bone metastasis
  ⇨CXR
- Evaluate for lung metastasis
  ➡Bone scan
- Evaluate for bone metastasis

VIII. Treatment

1. Treatment approach
   ➡Management according to stages
   | Stage | Approach |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | Early Stage I | Radiotherapy ONLY |
   | Intermediate Stage II | Concurrent chemoradiotherapy |
   | Advanced Stage III | Concurrent chemoradiotherapy |
   | Stage IVA | ± Adjuvant chemotherapy |
   | Stage IVB | |

➡Post-treatment follow-up

- Documentation of remission
  - Post-treatment baseline MRI of skull base and neck
  - PET-CT scan 3 months after treatment completion
- Post-treatment EBV DNA levels - Post-radiotherapy plasma EBV DNA is validated as the MOST significant
  prognostic biomarker to select high-risk patients for adjuvant chemotherapy

2. Radiotherapy
   ➡General features

- Remains the mainstay of treatment because it is a radiosensitive tumour and its anatomical location limits a surgical approach
- Bilateral neck irradiation is always included since NPC has a propensity to spread to bilateral regional lymph nodes in the neck
  ➡Side effects
- Mouth and throat sores

3. Chemotherapy
   ➡ Cisplatin

- Alkylating agent
  - Formation of DNA cross-links which inhibits DNA synthesis
  - Covalently binds to DNA bases and disrupts the DNA function
    Ο Denatures the double helix
- Side effects
  - Nephrotoxicity
  - Ototoxicity
  - Nausea and vomiting (76 - 100%)
    ➡Fluorouracil
- Antimetabolite
  - Pyrimidine analog which interferes with DNA and RNA synthesis
  - F-dUMP inhibits thymidylate synthetase and thus depletes thymidine triphosphate which is a necessary component of DNA synthesis
  - F-UMP incorporates into RNA to replace uracil and inhibits cell growth
- Side effects
  - Myelosuppression (Pancytopenia)
  - Alopecia
    Ο Stomatitis
    Ο Diarrhea

4. Surgical treatment
   ➡General features

- **NOT** used as first-line treatment
  - Deep anatomical location of the pharynx
  - Close proximity to critical neurovascular structures
- Nasopharyngectomy may be indicated in patients with small local recurrence
- Neck dissection may be indicated in patients with residual nodal disease following radiotherapy or an isolated neck recurrence

IX. Prevention

1. Screening
   ➡Rationale of screening

- High rate of NPC in specific geographical regions and among certain families
- High rate of cure for early-stage NPC
  ➡2 Practical ways to screen for EBV
- Immunoglobulin A viral capsid antigen (EBV VCA IgA)
- Plasma EBV DNA by PCR

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## CA Oropharynx

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Majority of oropharyngeal carcinoma are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)

- Includes tumours originating in tonsillar region, base of tongue, soft palate, posterolateral pharyngeal wall
  ➡Local invasion
- Direct extension of tumours from oropharynx into lateral tissues including pharyngeal constrictors may involve the spread into the parapharyngeal space
- Invasion into medial pterygoid muscle can involve the ascending ramus of mandible
  ➡Patterns of metastasis
- Lymph node metastasis
  - Metastasize to level II (**most common**), III, IV, V, parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal and contralateral nodal groups
  - Approximately 50% have metastasis at time of presentation
  - Bilateral metastasis are common from tumours arising in the tongue base and soft palate
  - SCC of oral cavity and lips tends to metastasize to Level I, II and III
  - SCC of the tongue tends to skip metastasis to level III and IV
- Distant metastasis
  - Uncommon but possible sites include brain, lung, liver, bone and skin

2. Concept of field cancerization
   ➡Diffuse and chronic exposure of mucosa of upper aerodigestive tract to carcinogenic substance leads to widespread changes in mucosal epithelium
   ➡Leads to development of separate tumours at different anatomical sites

- Increased risk of synchronous or metachronous tumour
  - _Synchronous_ tumour = Second primary tumour detected **within 6 months**
  - Metachronous tumour = Second primary tumour detected > **6 months**
- Patients who develop tumour in the oral cavity and the oropharynx are more likely to develop a second primary tumour in the upper esophagus
  - Surveillance to detect dysplasia with chromoendoscopy/ high-resolution white light endoscopy/ narrow band imaging (NBI) may be indicated to allow early effective treatment
- Patients who develop tumour in the larynx are more likely to develop as secondary primary tumour in the lung
  ➡Panendoscopy is always recommended
- Panendoscopy includes direct laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy and OGD
- Staging examination is recommended at the initial evaluation of all patients with primary cancers of upper aerodigestive tract

[Image of the number 254]

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡Male preponderance
   ➡Predominantly a disease of elderly (age > 60)

III. Etiology

1. Risk factors (4 Factors for H&N cancer = HPV + EBV + Smoking + Alcoholism)
   ➡Human papillomavirus virus (HPV) infection

- HPV Type 16 and 18
- HPV-associated H&N cancer occur primarily in the oropharynx including tonsils and the base of tongue
- HPV infection can induce two viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 which inactivate tumour suppressor 53 and Rb leading to tumor promotion
- Presents in young male patients who have a higher lifetime number of sexual partners and oral sex
- Define a distinct subset of patients compared with HPV negative tobacco or alcohol- driven oropharynx cancer with following features - Frequent LN metastasis - Higher response rate to induction chemotherapy - Better prognosis - Deintensification of treatment can be considered while obtaining the same locoregional and overall survival seen with standard treatment options
  ➡Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
- Majority are related to NPC but association with oral SCC are also suggested
  ➡ Smoking
- Synergism between smoking and alcohol in development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is well established
  ➡Alcoholism
- Synergism between smoking and alcohol in development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is well established
  ➡5Ss
- Smoking + Spirits + Sharp teeth + Sex (male/ oral) + Spicy food

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Minor salivary glands tumour

- May present as submucosal masses in the tongue base and soft palate
  ➡ Lymphoma
- Tonsils and tongue base may be the presenting site for a lymphoma

255

IV. **Pathogenesis**

1. Anatomical correlation

[Image Description: A drawing that depicts the oral cavity. On the left, there is a diagram of the mouth from a top-down perspective. The tongue is in the middle, and the areas marked in blue represent common sites for oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Text above the drawing indicates the Retromolar trigone. On the right, there is a cross-sectional illustration of the oral cavity and upper throat. Key anatomical structures are labeled with arrows pointing to them: Palatoglossal arch, Palatine tonsils, Palatopharyngeal arch, and Vallecula.]

➡ Oropharynx

- Extends vertically from soft palate to superior surface of hyoid bone (floor of vallecula)
- Laterally bounded by the pharyngeal constrictor muscles and medial aspect of mandible
- **Components**: Tonsillar region/ Base of tongue/ Soft palate/ Posterolateral pharyngeal wall

2. Pathogenesis
   ➡Premalignant lesions

- Erythroplakia
  - Defined as bright red plaque of oral mucosa that cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically (no histological correlation)
- Leukoplakia
  - Defined as white patch or plaque that cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically (no histological correlation)
  - Leukoplakia on the floor of the mouth has a particularly high risk of malignant transformation
- Speckled leukoplakia - Variation of leukoplakia arising on an erythematous base - Highest rate of malignant transformation
  ➡Pre-malignant lesions
- Plummer-Vinson syndrome (Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome)
  - Triad of iron deficiency anemia, dysphagia and cervical esophageal web
  - Well-established relationship with the development of oral cancer

256

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   - Ulcerative lesion or exophytic mass
     - Unilateral tonsillar enlargement or ulceration
   - "Hot-potato" voice
     - Muffled voice is seen with large tongue base tumours
   - Dysphagia and odynophagia
   - Otalgia
     - Referred otalgia mediated by tympanic branches of CN IX and CN X
   - Trismus
     - Indicates advanced disease and usually results from involvement of pterygoid
       musculature
   - Lymphadenopathy
     - Ipsilateral or bilateral non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy is a common presenting signs
       since the incidence of regional metastasis from oropharyngeal cancer is high
   - Constitutional symptoms
     - Weight loss

VI. **Diagnosis**

1. Radiological tests
   - USG-guided FNAC
     - USG has limited use in oropharyngeal cancer but is a useful adjunct for FNAC to ensure
       accurate aspiration of a deeply seated lymph node swelling
   - Panendoscopy with biopsy
     - Incisional biopsy should be performed in all cases
     - Assess tumour extend and look for synchronous tumour
   - CT scan
     - Useful to detect bony invasion
     - Detection of cervical lymph node metastasis
     - CT thorax and abdomen to assess for distant metastasis
   - MRI scan
     - Imaging modality of choice for cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx
     - Provides optimal visualization of soft-tissue infiltration of the tumour
     - Detection of cervical lymph node metastasis

[Image Description: This page contains text detailing clinical manifestations and diagnostic procedures. The "Clinical manifestation" section lists signs and symptoms, including ulcerative lesions, voice changes, dysphagia, otalgia, trismus, lymphadenopathy, and constitutional symptoms like weight loss. The "Diagnosis" section describes radiological tests such as USG-guided FNAC, panendoscopy with biopsy, CT scans for bony invasion and metastasis detection, and MRI scans for soft tissue visualization and metastasis detection.]

VII. Treatment

1. General principles
   ➡Tumours of the oropharynx tends to be chemosensitive
   ➡Adequate treatment of the neck is important because of high risk of regional metastasis
   ➡Minimally invasive technique to resect tumours of oropharynx include a transoral robotic surgical approach (TORS)

- Previously procedure might otherwise require a lip-splitting mandibulotomy approach to resect tumours of the oropharynx
- Associated with shorter length of hospital stay and less likely to be gastrostomy tube or tracheostomy dependent at 6 months
  ➡ Multidisciplinary approach including swallowing rehabilitation is important

2. General approach
   ➡Management of stage I and II (early) cancer (usually single modality)

- Primary surgery is recommended rather than definitive radiotherapy
- Selective neck dissection
  - Indicated for patients with stage I oral tongue cancer > 3mm and most stage II oral cavity cancers
  - Ipsilateral selective neck dissection of level I to III or IV is generally sufficient
  - Bilateral neck dissection is required if primary tumours are close to or involving the midline
- Post-operative radiotherapy - Radiotherapy of primary site and unilateral or bilateral neck if the tumour thickness > 4 mm or in presence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion
  ➡Management of stage III and IV (locoregionally advanced) cancer (usually combined modality)
- Surgical resection of primary treatment is suggested as initial therapy rather than radiotherapy or chemotherapy
  - Modified radical neck dissection and post-operative radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy
  - Definitive radiotherapy or chemotherapy are options for patients who are medically inoperable or have unresectable disease
- Concomitant chemoradiation is commonly utilized in advanced stage (III and IV) oropharyngeal carcinoma which effectively preserve function and associated with survival comparable to surgery with postoperative radiation

# ENT Diseases

## Laryngeal carcinoma (CA larynx)

I. Overview

1.  General features
    ➡Squamous cell carcinoma is the MOST common malignancy tumour

- Benign tumours of larynx are extremely rare
  ➡Larynx is divided into 3 anatomical regions
- Extends from the epiglottis superiorly to cricoid cartilage inferiorly
- Includes supraglottic larynx, glottic larynx and subglottic larynx
- Supraglottic cancer
- Presents as advanced disease due to paucity of symptoms
- Tends to be more aggressive
- Rich lymphatics resulting in higher incidence of lymph node metastasis
- Glottic larynx
- MOST common form of laryngeal cancer
- Presents with hoarseness due to involvement of true vocal cord and can be diagnosed at an early stage
- Subglottic cancer
- Presents as advanced disease due to paucity of symptoms
- Propensity for local extension
- Higher rates of local recurrence
- Poorer survival rates
  ➡LN metastasis
- High incidence of lymphatic spread from supraglottic (30 – 50%) and subglottic cancer (40%) but limited glottic cancer typically do not spread to regional lymphatics
- Supraglottic drainage
- Pierce thyrohyoid membrane with superior laryngeal artery, vein and nerve
- Drains mainly to subdigastric and superior jugular nodes
- Glottic and subglottic drainage
- Exit via cricothyroid ligament and end in the prelaryngeal node (delphian node), paratracheal node and deep cervical nodes along the inferior thyroid artery

II. Epidemiology

1.  General epidemiology
    ➡Male predominance

- Reflects effect of smoking and alcohol use

III. Etiology

1.  Risk factors
    ➡ Medical history

- Chronic laryngitis
- GERD or laryngopharyngeal reflux
  ➡Family history
- Family history of CA larynx
  ➡ Drug history
- Irradiation
  ➡Social history
- Smoking
- Alcoholism

[Image Description: The image is a page of text from a document titled "ENT Diseases." The main topic is "Laryngeal carcinoma (CA larynx)". The content is structured with headings and subheadings, bullet points, and indentation to organize information about the overview, epidemiology, and etiology of laryngeal carcinoma. Topics include details about the types of cancer (supraglottic, glottic, subglottic), lymphatic spread, risk factors like smoking, and medical history.]
259

IV. Pathophysiology

1. Functions of larynx
   ➡Phonation

- Production of a primary vocal tone at level of vocal folds
- Resonates in the pharynx and nose adding harmonics and timbre
- Articulates by fine motor control of tongue, palate and lips - Patients with cleft palate may have normal vocal fold function but a hypernasal voice due to palatal defect and poor velopharyngeal closure resulting in excess air escape through the nose - Patients with nasal congestion have hyponasal voice due to inadequate air escape through the nose
  ➡Maintain airway patency and protection during swallowing
- Important during respiration and swallowing
- Normal swallow mechanism includes laryngeal elevation, posterior deflection of the epiglottis, inhibition of respiration and closure of the vocal folds to prevent aspiration of ingested material
  ➡Valsalva maneuver
- Generation of increased pressure against a closed glottis
- Enables function such as coughing, throat clearing, straining and defecation

2. Anatomical correlation

[Image Description: The image is a detailed anatomical illustration of a coronal section through the larynx. The illustration is colorful and labels various structures within the larynx. The epiglottis is positioned at the top, followed by the superior thyroid veins, internal laryngeal nerve, and superior laryngeal artery on the left side. Further down are labeled the thyrohyoid muscle, ary-epiglottic part of the oblique arytenoid muscle, thyroid cartilage, lateral crico-arytenoid muscle, cricothyroid muscle, inferior constrictor muscle, sternothyroid muscle, cricoid cartilage, thyroid gland, recurrent laryngeal nerve, and inferior laryngeal artery. On the right side of the coronal section, labeled structures include the hyoid bone at the top, followed by the vestibule, vestibular fold, vocal fold, vocalis muscle, superior thyroid veins, conus elasticus, and infraglottic region. The overall structure shows the complex arrangement of muscles, nerves, and cartilage in the larynx.]

Anatomical structures are labeled with arrows pointing to each location.]

Anatomical levels

- Supraglottis
  - Refers to region above true vocal cord
  - Consists of epiglottis, false vocal cords, aryepiglottic folds and arytenoids
- Glottis
  - Consists of true vocal cords and immediate subjacent area extending 1 cm inferiorly
- Subglottis
  - Refers to region below the inferior border of glottis
  - Extends down to inferior border of cricoid cartilage
- Hypopharynx (Laryngopharynx)
  - Lies behind and besides the larynx and extends to esophageal inlet
  - Contains the pyriform sinuses, posterior pharyngeal wall and post-cricoid areas

Blood supply

Nerve supply

- Sensory innervation
  - Supraglottic space -> Internal branch of superior laryngeal nerve
  - Subglottic space -> Recurrent laryngeal nerve (From CN X)
- Motor innervation
  - All INTRINSIC muscles of larynx are supplied by recurrent laryngeal nerve
  - EXCEPT cricothyroid muscle being supplied by external branch of superior laryngeal nerve

VI. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Supraglottic tumours

- Sore throat
- Dysphonia ("_Hot-potato_" voice)
- Dysphagia
- Odynophagia
- Lymphadenopathy
- Referred otalgia
  ➡Glottic tumours
  - Hoarseness
    - Patient almost always present with voice changes
    - Hoarseness is an early symptom in patients with glottic tumours and therefore
      tend be discovered at an earlier stage than other H&N cancer
  - Airway compromise - Usually a late symptom - Result of tumour bulk or impaired vocal cord mobility due to direct muscle
    invasion or involvement of RLN
    ➡Subglottic tumours
  - Unilateral vocal cord palsy
  - Airway compromise

VII. **Diagnosis**

1. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Cervical lymphadenopathy

2. Radiological tests
   ➡Laryngoscopy (rigid/ flexible fibreoptic)

- Allows biopsy to confirm histology
- Determines the extent of local spread
- Key areas to note for tumour extension in - Supraglottic tumour = Vallecular/ Base of tongue/ Ventricle/ Arytenoid/ Anterior
  commissure - Glottic tumours = False cord/ Arytenoid/ Anterior commissure/ Subglottic
  ➡Panendoscopy (_Direct laryngoscopy_ + _Bronchoscopy_ + _OGD_)
- Exclude the presence of synchronous lesion
  ➡CT/MRI neck
- Evaluate extent of tumour invasion and demonstrate extra-laryngeal spread and
  suspicious LN involvement within neck
- Provides important staging information and is crucial for identifying cartilage erosion or
  invasion and extension into pre-epiglottic or paraglottic spaces

264

VIII. Treatment

1. General approach
   ➡ Early (Stage I and II) cancer
   _ Patients with early cancer should be treated with the intent to preserve the larynx
   ➡ Advanced (Stage III and IV) cancer
   _ Patients with good performance status should be treated with a functional organ-reservation strategy including chemoradiotherapy or larynx-preserving surgery with post-operative RT
   _ Patients who are not candidates for functional organ-reservation strategy should be treated with total laryngectomy with post-operative RT and voice rehabilitation
   _ Elderly patient or patients with poor functional status that cannot tolerate the associated toxicities of chemoradiotherapy
   _ Patients with resectable tumours with destruction of both vocal cords or extensive cartilage destruction such that vocal or airway protective function cannot be recovered
   ➡ Treatment of subglottic tumours
   _ Subglottic tumours are the least common and are commonly asymptomatic until locally advanced
   _ Higher rates of local recurrent and poor survival when compared with lesion involving the supraglottis or glottis
   _ Treatment is aggressive with initial surgical treatment consists of either total laryngectomy or partial laryngectomy in very selected case \* Thyroidectomy and bilateral paratracheal node dissection are usually performed

2. Treatment modalities
   ➡ Early (Stage I and II) cancer
   _ Radiotherapy
   _ Radiotherapy is often preferred because of better functional outcomes particularly voice quality while avoiding GA and other risks associated with surgery
   _ Radiation therapy is equally as effective as surgery in controlling disease for early stage cancers of the glottis
   _ Complications = Radiation dermatitis/ Hoarseness/ Dysphagia/ Odynophagia
   _ Larynx-preserving surgery
   _ Transoral laser microsurgery (TOLM)
   _ Partial open laryngectomy
   ➡ Advanced (Stage III and IV) cancer
   _ Chemotherapy + Radiotherapy
   _ Concurrent chemoradiotherapy
   _ Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy alone
   _ Sequential therapy with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy
   _ Larynx-preserving surgery + Post-operative radiotherapy ± Concurrent chemotherapy
   _ Transoral laser microsurgery (TOLM)
   _ Partial open laryngectomy
   _ Total laryngectomy + Post-operative radiotherapy
   _ Indicated for advanced tumours with extension beyond the endolarynx or with cartilage destruction \* Reconstruction by means of a pectoralis major flap or free flap reconstruction is required for lesions with pharyngeal extension
   265

3. Non-pharmacological treatment
   ➡Lifestyle modification

- Smoking cessation
- Limited alcohol intake
  ➡Speech rehabilitation\*
- Esophageal speech
  - Produced by actively swallowing and releasing air from esophagus which results in vibrations of the esophageal wall and pharynx
    - Patients learn to swallow air into pharynx and upper esophagus
    - On regurgitating the air a segment of pharyngo-esophageal mucosa vibrates to produce sound which is modified by the vocal tract into speech
  - Ability to create esophageal speech depends on the motivation of patients and their ability to control upper esophageal sphincter allowing injection and expulsion of air in a controlled fashion
- Tracheoesophageal speech
  - Tracheoesophageal puncture is a fistula created between the trachea and esophagus that permits placement of one-way valve that allows air from tracheal to enter the upper esophageal
  - Small one-way valve is inserted through back wall of tracheal stoma into pharynx
  - Allows air from trachea to pass into the pharynx but does not allow food and liquid to pass into airway
  - Example: Blom-Singer valve (prosthesis)/ Panje valve (prosthesis)
- Electrolarynx
  - Artificial larynx with an external device applied to soft tissues of neck
  - Electrolarynx creates vibratory sound waves when held against the neck or cheek
  - Vibrations create sound waves that the patient articulates into words
  - Disability of electrolarynx is the mechanical quality of sound produced
  - Most useful in postoperative period when training for esophageal speech
    ➡Swallowing rehabilitation\*
- Patient is instructed with various swallowing techniques and evaluate for the appropriate diet consistency
- Allow initiation of oral intake of nutrition while minimizing the risk of aspiration

266

4. Medical treatment
   ➡ Radiotherapy

- Primary RT offer improved functional outcomes and a high chance for preservation of voice quality while avoiding GA and other risk associated with surgery
- Post-operative RT is only indicated in selected patients with resected early stage cancer
  - Patients with compromised resection margins, lymphovascular or perineural invasion or upstaging to Stage III or IV cancer
- Post-operative RT is generally recommended for all patients with resected advanced stage cancer following larynx-preservation surgery or total laryngectomy
- Complications
  - Hoarseness/ Odynophagia/ Dysphagia
  - Radiation dermatitis
  - Laryngeal edema
  - Laryngeal or pharyngeal stenosis

➡ Chemotherapy

- Chemotherapy alone does NOT have a role in treatment of early stage cancer
  - Only uncommon and highly selected patients with T2 cancers (e.g. bulky, invasive T2 cancer with impaired vocal cord mobility) is appropriate for concurrent chemoradiation

267

5. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Transoral laser microsurgery (TOLM)

- All larynx-preserving surgery should be undertaken only when the surgeon is confident that tumour-free margin can be obtained because post-operative RT may compromise functional outcomes particularly after open surgical procedures
- At least one functional arytenoid complex must be preserved so that function of larynx is maintained
- CO2 laser is used because its frequency of light is absorbed by water thus minimizing tissue damage
- Advantages over partial open laryngectomy - Decreased morbidity such as need for tracheostomy and nasogastric feeding - Improved preservation of laryngeal function - Lower cost - Shorter hospital stay
  ➡ Partial open laryngectomy
- All larynx-preserving surgery should be undertaken only when the surgeon is confident that tumour-free margin can be obtained because post-operative RT may compromise functional outcomes particularly after open surgical procedures
- Complications - Laryngocutaneous fistula - Aspiration pneumonia - Swallowing difficulties - Bleeding and infection
  ➡ Total laryngectomy
- Procedures
  - Remaining trachea is brought out onto the lower neck as a permanent tracheal stoma after larynx is removed
  - Hypopharynx which is opened at time of operation is subsequently closed to restore continuity for swallowing
  - Upper aero-tract and digestive tract are permanently disconnected
  - Part or all of thyroid gland and associated parathyroid gland may also be removed depending on extent of disease
- Advantages
  - Protection from aspiration pneumonia
- Disadvantages
  - Stigmatization with the presence of permanent tracheostomy
- Complications
  - Loss of ability to speak
  - Loss of coughing effort
  - Swallowing dysfunction (Stricture of neopharynx or anastomosis/ Regurgitation)
  - Endocrine dysfunction (Hypothyroidism/ Hypoparathyroidism)

## Nipple discharge and inversion

I. **Nipple discharge**

1. Types of nipple discharge
   ➡Lactation

- Normal milk production during pregnancy and post-partum period and may continue for at least 6 months (up to 2 years) after delivery or cessation of breastfeeding
- Bloody nipple discharge can be seen in 20% of women during 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy and during lactation which is usually benign
  ➡Galactorrhea
- Galactorrhea is milky discharge unrelated to breastfeeding
- Commonly manifests as bilateral milky nipple discharge involving multiple ducts
- Often caused by hyperprolactinemia
- Hypothalamic-pituitary disease
- Prolactinoma\* (Lactotroph adenoma)
- Tumours (Craniopharyngioma/ Metastatic cancer)
- Infiltrative disease (Sarcoidosis)
- Head trauma/ Surgery
- Drug-induced
- Antipsychotics\* (Haloperidol/ Risperidone)
- Antidepressants (Amitriptyline/ Clomipramine)
- Antiemetics (Metoclopramide/ Domperidone)
- Miscellaneous
- Stress
- Hypothyroidism (↓ Clearance of prolactin)
- Chronic renal failure (CKD) (↓ Clearance of prolactin)
  ➡Pathological nipple discharge
- Secretory production of fluid other than milk
- Commonly manifests as spontaneous, persistent unilateral discharge
- Can be serous (clear or yellow), sanguineous (bloody) or serosanguineous (blood-tinged)
- Potential etiologies include intraductal papilloma (**most common**), duct ectasia and fibrocystic breast changes
- **Malignancy** is the underlying cause in 5 – 15% of cases and the most common malignancy associated is DCIS

269

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Straw-colored (yellow) or clear transparent (serous) discharge

- Intraductal papilloma (**classical**)
  - Muscularis arteries that run through the peduncle of intraductal papilloma supply adequate blood flow to neoplasm but lymphatic and veins are compromised
  - Resulting increased in vascular pressure cause a transudate to form in duct
- Duct ectasia
  - Creamy cheesy nipple discharge
  - Multi-colored (green/ blue/ black/ occasionally blood-stained)
- Underlying malignancy - Ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) - Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)
  ➡ Bloody discharge
- Intraductal papilloma
  - Bleeding intraductal papilloma
- Underlying malignancy
  - Ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS)
  - Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)
- Fibrocystic breast changes with active intraductal component
  - Duct ectasia
  - Intraductal hyperplasia
  - Plasma cell mastitis

3. Management
   ➡ Medical treatment

- Prolactinoma: Bromocriptine/ Cabergoline
- Drug-induced: Reassurance and continuation of drug/ Taper or change medication
  ➡ Surgical treatment
- Prolactinoma: Transphenoidal resection
  - Refractory to dopamine agonists
  - Women have giant lactotroph adenoma and wishes to become pregnant (if patient becomes pregnant and discontinue the agonist during pregnancy, the adenoma may increase to clinically important size before delivery)
- Microdochectomy (Excision of single duct and its associated lobules)
  - Using a ductogram or ductoscopy
  - Indicated for persistent spontaneous discharge
- Major duct excision (Excision of all retroareolar duct)
  - Indicated for persistent spontaneous discharge

270

II. Nipple inversion

1. Causes of nipple inversion
   ➡Congenital nipple inversion

- Usually bilateral and benign in nature
- Results of failure of underlying mesenchymal tissue to proliferate and project the nipple papilla outwards
  ➡Acquired nipple inversion
- Underlying malignancy
- Inflammation
  Ο Duct ectasia
  Ο Periductal mastitis
  Ο Subareolar abscess and periareolar fistula
  Ο Tuberculosis mastitis
  • Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis

## II. Fibrocystic breast changes (FBC)

1. Overview

- MOST frequent benign disorder of the breast
- NOT a disease but a general term for a group of anomalies and symptoms
- Refers to a spectrum of histopathologic changes
  - Pathologic features include stromal fibrosis, macro- and microcysts, apocrine metaplasia, hyperplasia and adenosis
- Affects women of reproductive age (i.e. premenopausal)
- Unknown etiology but is believed to be result from hormonal imbalance
  - Estrogen predominance over progesterone
- Clinical presentation
  - Nodularity
    - Generally does NOT form a discrete or well-defined mass
    - Fibrotic tissues may be palpated and generally in the upper outer quadrants
    - Increases in size before menses and return to baseline after onset of menstrual flow
  - Breast pain
    - Can be cyclical or constant, unilateral or bilateral or focal in nature
  - Nipple discharge

273

2. Breast cysts
   ➡General features

- Fluid-filled, round or ovoid masses derived from terminal duct-lobular unit (TDLU)
- Begins as fluid accumulation in the TDLU due to distension and obstruction of the efferent ductule
  ➡Clinical presentation
- Breast mass
  - Number: Solitary
  - Size: Large (gross) or small (microcysts)
  - Border: Discrete/ Ill-defined
  - Surface: Smooth
  - Consistency: Firm
  - Tenderness: Painful/ Painless

- Breast pain - Acute enlargement of cyst can cause severe localized pain of sudden onset
  ➡Diagnosis

| Modalities  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ultrasound  | ➡ Simple cyst (CA risk = 0%) - Well-circumscribed anechoic lesions - Thin septation that is < 0.5 mm in thickness - **NO** internal echoes, solid components or vascular flow on Doppler ➡ Complicated cyst (CA risk < 1%) - Internal echoes due to echogenic debris - **NO** solid components or vascular flow on Doppler ➡ Complex cyst (CA risk < 1-23%) - Lobulations - Anechoic and hyperechogenic components - Thick walls and thick septa > 0.5 mm in thickness - Mixed solid and cystic components |
| Mammography | ➡Density that has well-defined or partially obscured border                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| MRI         | ➡Bright, high-signal-intensity T2 fat-suppressed weighted images                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

➡Management (Asymptomatic → Observe; Symptomatic → FNAC)

- Simple cyst
  - FNAC is therapeutic and is indicated if symptomatic (severe pain)
    - Aspirate to dryness if the fluid is not blood-stained and fluid does not need to be sent for cytology since this is not cost-effective
  - Aspirate that is bloody or does **NOT** resolve completely should be further evaluated by imaging and core needle biopsy
- Complicated cyst
  - Should be confirmed by core needle biopsy since there is concern of underlying malignancy
- Complex cyst
  - Should be confirmed by core needle biopsy since there is concern of underlying malignancy
  - Core needle biopsy is indicated when no fluid is obtained by FNAC and is essential to target the solid component of the lesion

274

3. Atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia (ADH/ ALH)
   ➡General features

- Pathological diagnosis usually found as breast mass or incidental finding of imaging or biopsy results
- Confers a substantial increase in risk of subsequent CA breast in both ipsilateral and contralateral breast
- Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)
  - Proliferation of uniform epithelial cells with monomorphic round nuclei filling part but not entirely the involved duct
- Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) - Monomorphic, evenly spaced dyshesive cells filling part but not entirely the involved lobule
  ➡Management
- Avoidance of OC pills and HRT
- Ongoing surveillance is required
  - Yearly mammography
  - Twice yearly breast examination
- Hormonal therapy
  - SERMs including tamoxifen
  - Aromatase inhibitors

275

III. **Neoplasms**

1. Intraductal papilloma
   ➡ General features

- Benign tumour of the epithelium of mammary ducts
- Occurs as a solitary or multiple lesions
  - Diffuse papillomatosis (multiple papilloma) is defined as a minimum of 5 papilloma within a localized segment of breast tissue
- Diagnosed by core needle biopsy
- Associated with a slightly higher risk of developing CA breast
  ➡ Clinical manifestation
- Nipple discharge - Bloody nipple discharge is characteristic - Serous or serosanguinous discharge is also possible
  ➡ Management
- Microdochectomy
  - Surgical excision or removal of lactiferous duct
  - Recommended and is the standard approach to a papilloma diagnosed by biopsy

276

2. Fibroadenoma
   ➡General features

- **MOST** common benign tumour of the breast
- Benign solid tumours containing glandular and fibrous tissues
- Unknown etiology but likely to be hormonal-dependent neoplasm
  - Increase in size during pregnancy or with estrogen-based OC pills
  - Persist during reproductive years
  - Decrease in size or regress after menopause
- Histological features influence the risk of subsequent CA breast
  - Simple fibroadenoma has **NO** increased risk of CA breast
  - Complex fibroadenoma shows other proliferative changes on histology including papillary apocrine changes, ductal hyperplasia, sclerosing adenosis and is associated with higher risk of subsequent CA breast
- Other subtypes of fibroadenoma
  - Giant fibroadenoma defined as > 10 cm should be excised since it **CANNOT** be distinguished from Phyllodes tumour from physical examination or imaging
  - Juvenile fibroadenoma occurs in young girls aged 10 – 18 should be carefully follow-up and excision is recommended if the lesion > 5 cm or persists to adulthood since the risk of breast cancer increases
    ➡ Epidemiology
- Occurs in young women of age 15–35
  ➡Clinical presentation
- Breast mass (“_Breast mouse_”)
  - Site: Can be anywhere in the breast (20% multiple in ipsilateral or bilateral breast)
  - Size: Can be of any size
  - Shape: Spherical or ovoid and sometimes lobulated
  - Border: Well-defined
  - Surface: Smooth
  - Consistency: Rubbery/ Firm
  - Tenderness: Non-tender
  - Mobility: Most mobile of all lesions
    ➡ Diagnosis
- Well-circumscribed solid mass on imaging
- Definitive diagnosis can only be confirmed with core needle biopsy or excision
  ➡Management
- Conservative treatment
  - Indicated if size < 2 cm and clinical and radiographic appearance is consistent with fibroadenoma
- Wide local excision
  - Indicated in fibroadenoma that is symptomatic, size > 2 cm or increases in size
  - **NOT** necessary to excise all biopsy-proven fibroadenoma since it can induce scarring, dimpling of breast from tumour removal, damage to ductal system and mammographic changes
- Ultrasound-guided cryoablation/ vacuum-assisted excision
  - Minimally-invasive alternative to surgical excision in patients who would wish to avoid surgery

277

3. Phyllodes tumour
   ➡General features

- Phyllodes means "leaf-like" which describes the typical papillary projections that are seen on pathological examination
- Resemble fibroadenoma both clinically and on imaging BUT the large size and history of rapid growth should raise suspicion of Phyllodes tumours
- Benign = 90%; Malignant = 10%
- Least aggressive form behaves like benign fibroadenoma
  - Propensity to recur following excision without wide margin
- Most aggressive form can metastasize distantly commonly to the lungs
  - Degenerating histologically into sarcomatous lesions that lack an epithelial component
- Associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome which is a rare AD condition that is characterized by development of multiple tumours

➡ Epidemiology

- Accounts for < 1% of all breast neoplasms
- Median age of diagnosis = 42 – 45 years old

➡Clinical manifestation

- Breast mass
  - Site: Can be anywhere in the breast
  - Size: Can be of any size
  - Border: Well-defined
  - Surface: Smooth or multinodular
  - Consistency: Firm
  - Tenderness: Non-tender
  - Mobility: Mobile
- Overlying skin changes
  - Shiny stretched and attenuated skin can be seen overlying a large tumour
  - Can distort the contour of breast with pressure necrosis of overlying skin
- Axillary lymphadenopathy
  - Occurs in 20% of patients
  - Majority is actually reactive lymphadenopathy and metastatic involvement of lymph nodes is rare

➡ Pathogenesis

- Characteristic leaf-like architecture consisting of elongated cleft-like spaces that contain papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with varying degrees of atypia
- Phyllodes tumour can be classified as benign, borderline or malignant based on assessment of the following histological features
  - High mitotic rate
  - Infiltrative tumour margins
  - Marked stromal cellularity and atypia
  - Presence of stromal overgrowth

278

➡ Diagnosis

- Mammography
  - Presents as a non-palpable mass in 20% of patients and identified on screening mammography
  - Typical appearance is a smooth, polylobulated mass resembling a fibroadenoma
- USG breast
  - Solid hypoechoic and well-circumscribed lesions resembling a fibroadenoma
  - Cystic areas within the mass may increase level of suspicion of Phyllodes tumours
- FNAC/ Core needle biopsy/ Excisional biopsy
  - FNAC cannot reliably diagnose theses tumours and there at least a core needle biopsy is required
  - Core needle biopsy is typically diagnostic and features include increased cellularity, mitosis, stromal overgrowth and fragmentation
  - Excisional biopsy is indicated when the result of core biopsy is indeterminate or there is clinical-pathological discordance
    ➡ Management
- Patients should be followed with breast examination every 6 months and annual CXR and mammograms

4. Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM)
   ➡General features

- Rare benign inflammatory breast disease of unknown etiology which mimics CA breast
- Self-limiting disease that resolves slowly with complete resolution in 9 - 12 months
- Occurs in young parous women within a few years of pregnancy but can also occur in nulliparous woman
- Association with _Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii_ infection
- **NO** increased risk of subsequent CA breast

➡ Diagnosis

- Diagnosis of exclusion after excluding granulomatous disease such as TB, sarcoidosis, histoplasmosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener's granulomatosis)
- Core needle biopsy
  - Biopsy finding demonstrate granulomatous lesions centred on breast lobules
  - Biopsy must be sent for Gram stain, bacterial culture, AFB stain and culture, fungal stain and culture
- Subsequent diagnostic workup
  - Serum prolactin level (possible pathogenic link between hyperprolactinemia and IGM)
  - HBV serology (pre-steroid workup)
    ➡Management
- NSAIDS
  - Localized pain can be managed with NSAIDs
- Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin)
  - Indicated if Corynebacterium infection is recovered from biopsy
  - Doxycycline can be used for penicillin allergy
- Corticosteroids ± Methotrexate (MTX)\*
  - Routine use of steroids or methotrexate is not recommended but is useful in patient unresponsive to NSAIDs or antibiotics
  - Reduces swelling but may not alter the natural history of condition
  - Discontinuation or tapering is associated with rebound inflammation
- **X** Surgical excision
  - **NOT** recommended since surgical excision of IGM is often followed by slow wound healing

V. **Proliferative stromal lesions**

1. Diabetic (DM) mastopathy
   ➡General features

- Also known as lymphocytic mastitis or lymphocytic mastopathy
- Occurs in premenopausal women who have Type 1 DM
- Unknown etiology but may represent an autoimmune reaction
- Does **NOT** increase the risk of subsequent breast cancer

2. Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia
   ➡General features

- Benign stromal proliferation that simulates a vascular lesion
- Presents as a mass or thickening on physical examination
- Does **NOT** increase the risk of subsequent breast cancer

# Breast cancer

I. General features

1. Mode of spread
   ➡ Direct spread
   - Chest wall
   - Skin and subcutaneous tissues
     ➡ Lymphatic spread
   - General features
     - Axillary (including infraclavicular), supraclavicular and internal mammary
       lymph nodes are commonly involved
     - Lateral tumours in outer quadrant and centrally located lesions → Axillary LN
     - Upper and lower inner quadrant → Internal mammary LN
     - Supraclavicular LN can be primary or secondary site of spread
   - Sentinel lymph node - 1st lymph node that cancer cells are most likely to spread from a primary tumour
     which is usually the lymph node that is closest to the tumour - Perform biopsy to determine whether cancer cells are present - -ve results indicate cancer did not spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs
     and thus lymph node surgery can be spared
     ➡ Hematogenous spread
   - Distant metastasis
     - Lungs/ Liver/ Bone/ Brain/ Ovaries/ Adrenals/ Pleura

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology

| H&N            | X        | Possible |
| Melanoma       | X        | Possible |

➡Estrogen status

- ↑ Risk of breast cancer in particular hormone receptor-positive breast cancer
- Long duration of reproductive life increases exposure to estrogen peaks during menstrual cycle
- Endogenous estrogen
  - Early menarche < 12 (_Normal_ = 10 – 16)
  - Late menopause > 55 (_Normal_ = 40 – 55)
  - Nulliparity
  - No breastfeeding
  - Late age of first pregnancy > 30
  - Estrogen-secreting ovarian tumour
- Exogenous estrogen
  - Oral contraceptives (estrogen-based)
  - Hormone replacement therapy

➡ Medical history

- History of breast cancer
  - ↑ Risk of breast cancer in contralateral breast
- History of benign breast disease
  - Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)
  - Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH)
- Obesity (High BMI) - Depends on the menopausal status of women - ↓ Risk in premenopausal women since estrogen synthesis is in the ovaries - ↑ Risk in postmenopausal women since estrogen synthesis is in the peripheral adipose tissue primarily mediated by aromatase
  ➡ Drug history
- Exposure to therapeutic ionizing radiation
  ➡ Family history
- History of breast cancer
- Li-Fraumeni syndrome
  - Germline abnormalities of TP53 gene
  - Tendency to develop malignancy including breast cancer, sarcoma, brain tumours, adrenocortical cancer and leukemia

  ➡ Social history
- Smoking
- Alcoholism

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Paget disease of the nipple

- Paget disease of the nipple is characterized by eczematoid changes and ulcerated lesions of nipple-areolar complex
- Almost **ALWAYS** (80% of cases) are associated with underlying breast cancer which are HER2 +ve
- Presents with pain, burning, pruritus, palpable breast mass, bloody nipple discharge or nipple inversion
- Mammography is mandatory to look for associated mass as well as exclude synchronous cancers or widespread calcification that might preclude BCT
- USG is used to further evaluate and guide core biopsy of any palpable mass or mass-like mammographic abnormalities
- Diagnosis is based on full-thickness wedge biopsy of the nipple and underlying breast tissue
  - Pathological hallmark is the presence of malignant intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells (Paget cells) occurring within the epidermis of the nipple
- Treatment should include excision of the underlying cancer and nipple-areolar complex
  - Both mastectomy or BCT followed by whole-breast irradiation are acceptable treatment options

➡Phyllodes tumours

- Fibroepithelial breast tumours that can be classified as benign, borderline or malignant based on histological criteria

➡Breast sarcoma

- Homogenous tumours arising from the connective tissues within the breast

➡ Lymphoma

- Lymphoma of the breast presents as a painless unilateral breast mass
- Majority of lymphoma are non-Hodgkin lymphoma mostly of B-cell lineage

# IV. Pathophysiology

## 1. Anatomy of breast

[Anatomical illustration of the female breast, with various structures labeled. On the left, the image shows a full view of the breast, revealing internal structures such as the pectoralis major muscle, serratus anterior muscle, lobules, external oblique muscle, lactiferous ducts, and lactiferous sinus. The suspensory ligament of the breast (Cooper's ligament) is also clearly indicated. On the right, a cross-sectional view of the breast highlights the subclavius muscle, pectoralis major muscle, suspensory ligaments of the breast (Cooper's ligament), lactiferous ducts, lactiferous sinus, lobules, and fat (subcutaneous tissue layer).]

➡ Lies between 2nd and 6th rib in vertical axis and between sternal edge and mid-axillary line (MAL) in the horizontal axis
➡ Structure of breast

- Breast comprises 3 major structures including skin, subcutaneous tissue and breast tissue
- Breast tissue is composed of epithelial and stromal elements
  - Epithelial components include ducts that connect structural and functional units of the breast (lobules) to the nipple
  - Stromal components include adipose tissues and fibrous connective tissues
- Lobules are separated by suspensory ligament of breast (Cooper's ligament) - Dimpling of skin over breast cancer is due to malignant infiltration and contraction of Cooper's ligament
  ➡ Lymphovascular supply

| Arterial supply                                                        | Venous drainage              | Lymphatic drainage                  |

[Detailed anatomical illustration of the axillary region, focusing on the axillary lymph nodes and their relationship to the pectoralis minor muscle. The image includes the axillary nodes labeled as Level I, Level II, and Level III, indicating their position relative to the pectoralis minor muscle. Arrows denote the direction of lymphatic drainage. Additionally, the diagram shows the internal mammary nodes, supraclavicular nodes, axillary artery and vein, and pectoralis minor muscle. Different colors and shades are used to distinguish between various anatomical structures. Overall, it is a detailed medical illustration used for educational purposes to describe the lymphatic drainage pathways in the axillary region and their clinical relevance.]

➡Axillary lymph nodes are divided into 3 levels based upon the relationship to pectoralis minor
muscles

| Level     | Description                                                                          | Lymph nodes                                                                                                      |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level I   | Inferior and lateral to pectoralis minor muscle                                      | ➡ Anterior axillary nodes (pectoral) ➡ Posterior axillary nodes (subscapular) ➡ Lateral axillary nodes (humeral) |
| Level II  | Posterior to pectoralis minor muscle and below the axillary vein                     | ➡ Central axillary nodes                                                                                         |
| Level III | Medial to pectoralis minor extending up to apex against chest wall (Infraclavicular) | ➡ Interpectoral nodes (Rotter's) ➡ Apical axillary nodes (subclavian)                                            |

Remarks: Involvement of Level III nodes alters N staging classification due to poor prognosis and is by
definition pN3 status

➡Axillary vessels

- Axillary arteries
- Axillary veins

➡Axillary nerve supply

- Sensory nerves
  - Intercostobrachial nerve → Supply skin on medial and posterior arm and the posterior axillary line
- Motor nerves
  - Thoracodorsal nerve → Supply latissimus dorsi muscle
  - Long thoracic nerve → Supply serratus anterior muscle
  - Medial and lateral pectoral nerve → Supply pectoralis major and minor muscles

Pathogenesis

1. Different types of breast cancers

| Types                           | Presentation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Tumour characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) | ➡ NO symptoms or findings on physical examination in most cases - Occasionally palpable ➡Incidental finding by mammography - Presence of microcalcifications is characteristic Ο Linear branching or clustered pleomorphic microcalcification ➡Usually unifocal but can be multifocal or multicentric ➡DCIS is considered as a cancer by itself ➡DCIS is considered as a pre-invasive lesion - **Higher** risk of subsequent invasive cancer - Progresses into invasive cancer in ipsilateral breast ➡Should be treated as malignancy since it has the potential to develop into invasive cancer - Surgical options depend on age of patient, extent of disease, multicentricity of disease, grade and margin status - Management depends on Van Nuys Prognostic Index Ο Low score: Wide local excision (partial mastectomy) Ο Medium score: Wide local excision (partial mastectomy) + Adjuvant radiotherapy • High score: Total (simple) mastectomy | ➡Arises from lobules and terminal ducts of the breast with **ductal** predominance ➡Confined to basement membrane ➡5 architectural subtypes - Comedo (necrosis)/ Papillary/ Micropapillary/ Solid/ Cribriform - Comedo DCIS (high-grade) Ο 50% evolve into invasive cancer within 5 years - Non-comedo DCIS Ο 30% evolve into invasive cancer within 10 - 15 years ➡E-cadherin +ve |

| Score | Age     | Size       | Histology           | Margin width |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| 1     | > 60    | < 16 mm    | G1 – 2, no necrosis | ≥ 10 mm      |
| 2     | 40 - 60 | 16 - 40 mm | G1 – 2, necrosis    | 1 – 9 mm     |
| 3     | < 40    | > 40 mm    | G3                  | < 1 mm       |

Remarks:

- Low score = 4 – 6, 7 with margin widths ≥ 3 mm
- Medium score = 7 with margin widths < 3 mm, 8 with margin widths ≥ 3 mm, 9 with margin widths ≥ 5 mm
- High score = 8 with margin widths <3 mm, 9 with margin widths < 5 mm, 10 – 12

➡ Surgical treatment

- Wide local excision (partial mastectomy) is indicated for unicentric non-palpable lesions
- Total (simple) mastectomy is indicated for multicentric lesions, high tumour-to-breast ratio or persistently positive margins following wide local excision (partial mastectomy)
- Resection margin supposed to be wider since it is famous for skip lesion (resection margin ≥ 2 mm) (previously 10 mm)
  ➡ Management of axillary LNs
- Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is **NOT** indicated for pure DCIS
  - Positive sentinel node already indicates invasive breast cancer and changes the stage of disease
- Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) - DCIS theoretically do not require assessment of axillary nodes since it is not invasive and does not metastasize (confined to breast) - May be considered when there is a reasonable probability of finding invasive cancer on final pathologic examination (e.g. > 4 cm, palpable, comedo (high-grade) subtype) - Some surgeons perform SLNB in all patients because SLNB cannot be performed post-mastectomy if an occult invasive cancer is incidentally found - Lymphatic drainage pattern will be permanently altered total mastectomy, thus impossible to accurately perform SLNB later if an invasive cancer is found unexpectedly in the mastectomy specimen
  ➡ Adjuvant radiotherapy
- Should be given to patients treated with wide local excision (partial mastectomy) to reduce local recurrence rate
  ➡ Adjuvant hormonal therapy
- ER positive DCIS benefits from tamoxifen in reducing risk of breast cancer recurrence and risk of developing a new contralateral breast cancer, but no survival benefit
- Aromatase inhibitors are used as alternatives in post-menopausal women

Lobular carcinoma-
in-situ (LCIS)
➡**NO** symptoms or findings on physical examination and
mammography in most cases
➡Incidental finding by breast biopsy
➡Usually multifocal + multicentric + bilateral

- Multifocal = 2 or more lesion within same quadrant
- Multicentric = Lesions in different quadrants
  ➡Easily missed by mammography
- Rarely associates with microcalcifications
  ➡LCIS is **NOT** considered as cancer or pre-invasive lesion by itself
- Removed from AJCC staging system to avoid confusion
  ➡LCIS is **NOT** considered as a pre-invasive lesion
- Lower risk of subsequent invasive cancer
- Simply considered as an indicator for increased risk of breast
  cancer of approximately 1%/ year
- Cancer that develops may be IDC or ILC and may occur in
  both ipsilateral and contralateral breast
  ➡Management options of LCIS include the following
- Lifelong close surveillance
- Chemoprevention with tamoxifen, raloxifene (which has
  been validated in post-menopausal setting) or aromatase
  inhibitor
- Bilateral total mastectomy with immediate reconstruction for
  selected women with a strong family history
  ➡Arises from lobules and terminal ducts of
  the breast with _lobule_ predominance
  ➡Confined to basement membrane
  ➡Pleomorphic LCIS is a particularly
  aggressive subtype of LCIS that is treated
  more like DCIS
  ➡E-cadherin -ve
- Loss of E-cadherin (involved in
  cell-cell adhesion) can be stained
  for on pathology slides to clarify

| Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)  | ➡ Accounts for 70 – 80% of invasive breast cancers (**most** common) ➡ Associated with ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) ➡ Clinical examination - Grossly palpable mass ➡ Metastasis - Earlier than invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) ➡ Poor prognosis - Compared to other subtypes of invasive breast cancer ➡ Cords and nests of cells with varying amount of gland formation ➡ Divided into grades based on architectural and cytological features - Well-differentiated (Grade 1) - Moderately-differentiated (Grade 2) - Poorly-differentiated (Grade 3) |
| Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) | ➡ Accounts for 5 - 10% of invasive breast cancers (**second most** common) ➡ Usually multifocal + multicentric + bilateral ➡ Generally ER +ve only with occasional variable expression ➡ Arises in older woman associated with the use of post- menopausal hormone therapy ➡ Metastasis - Later than invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) - Metastasize to unusual location including meninges, gastrointestinal tract and peritoneum ➡ Smalls cells that infiltrate mammary stroma and adipose tissue in a single file pattern                                 |

| ➡ Poor prognosis - Similar to IDC but short-term outcomes may be more favorable
| ➡ Other histological subtypes associated with a **good** prognosis - Tubular carcinoma - Medullary carcinoma - Mucinous (colloid) carcinoma - Papillary carcinoma
| ➡ Other histological subtypes associated with a **poor** prognosis - Mixed ductal/lobular carcinoma - Metaplastic carcinoma - Micropapillary carcinoma

➡Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)

- Rare and aggressive form of breast cancer
- By definition tumour stage T4d in TNM staging (AJCC UICC 2017)
- Resembles mastitis clinically and radiologically
  - Mastitis is associated with fever and leukocytosis whereas IBC is **NOT** a true inflammatory process
- Diagnostic criteria
  - Rapid onset of breast erythema, edema, peau d’ orange or warm breast with or without an underlying palpable breast mass
  - Erythema occupying at least 1/3 of the breast
  - Duration of history no more than 6 months
  - Pathological confirmation of invasive carcinoma

➡Atypical ductal/ lobular hyperplasia (ADH/ALH)

- Proliferative lesions with cellular atypia that arises from breast ducts (ADH) and lobules (ALH) respectively
- Considered as high-risk lesions that may have malignancy at the same site and therefore should undergo biopsy
  - ADH has a 4 – 5x increased relative risk of developing invasive breast cancer
  - ALH historically has a weaker association with malignancy but a recent study suggested that it confers equal levels of risk with ADH
- If atypical hyperplasia is found on core needle biopsy, an excisional biopsy **MUST** be performed to rule out associated malignancy
  - If malignancy is found on postoperative pathology, manage accordingly depending on the final histology (DCIS/IDC, LCIS/ILC)
  - If no malignancy is found on postoperative pathology, there are 2 options
    - Surveillance with imaging and physical examination
    - Chemoprevention with tamoxifen

VI. Clinical manifestations

1. Signs and symptoms

[Diagram illustrating breast cancer signs: An image shows a central "Look For" prompt with arrows pointing to six different breast conditions. The conditions are "Lump" (a photo of a breast with a visible lump), "Skin Changes" (a breast showing skin irregularities), "Pulled in Nipple" (nipple is retracted inward), "Redness/Rash" (a breast with red and irritated skin), "Dimpling" (dimpled breast skin), and "Dripping" (nipple discharge).]

➡Breast mass

- Site: 50% of CA breast occurs in upper outer quadrant including the axillary tail
- Color: Discoloration (smooth and reddening) if tumour is close to overlying skin
- Shape: Spiculated
- Edge: Irregular or nodular
- Surface: Usually indistinct
- Consistency: Solid and stony hard
- Tenderness: Usually non-tender
- Mobility: Fixation of lump (Immovable) is almost diagnostic
- Lymph nodes: May be palpable and enlarged axillary LN
- Other classical features: Peau d' orange
  - Tumour spread along fibrous septa of breast and blocks the lymphatics alongside
  - Leads to edema of overlying skin between the many small pits which mark the opening of hair follicles and sweat glands

➡Nipple changes (5Ds)

- Deviation/ Displacement
- Discoloration
- Dermatitis (Eczema in Paget's disease of nipple)
- Depression (Retraction/ Inversion)
- Discharge

➡Constitutional symptoms

- Anorexia
- Weight loss
- Fatigue
  ➡Signs and symptoms of locally advanced disease
- Axillary lymphadenopathy
- Skin dimpling or tethering
- Erythema and thickening of overlying skin
- Peau d' orange appearance
  ➡Signs and symptoms of metastatic disease
- Lung metastasis
  - Dyspnea
  - Cough and sputum
- Liver metastasis
  - Jaundice
  - Nausea and vomiting
  - Abdominal pain
- Bone metastasis
  - Back pain

VII. Diagnosis (Triple assessment: Clinical)

1. General examination
   ➡Introduce yourself
   ➡3C and hand hygiene
   ➡ Preparation

- Positioning = 45° or sitting position if bed is not available
- Exposure = From clavicle to upper abdomen exposing both breast and axilla

2. Components of general examination
   ➡Describe the surrounding environment (IV drop/ O2 supplementation/ Diet restriction)
   ➡General appearance/ Vital signs/ Hydration status/ Body build (Cachexic/ Obese)
   ➡Pallor/Jaundice/ Central cyanosis/ LYMPHADENOPATHY/ Pulse/ Ankle edema
3. Inspection
   ➡Look for size, symmetry and scars (3Ss)

- Marked size difference of recent onset is likely to be pathological
- Asymmetry in the breast contours
- Scars from previous operation or biopsy for sentinel LN - Infra-mammillary folds/ Peri-areolar region/ Axillary skin folds
  ➡Look for overlying skin changes
- Lump/ nodules
- Ulceration
- Discoloration: Erythema/ Hematoma/ Ecchymosis (in fat necrosis)
- Puckering/ Dimpling: Underlying cancer
- Peau d' orange (Orange-peel appearance): Underlying malignancy
  ➡Look for nipple changes (5Ds)
- Deviation/ Displacement
- Discoloration
- Dermatitis (Eczema in Paget's disease of nipple)
- Depression (Retraction/Inversion)
- Discharge
  ➡ Maneuvers
- Patient is asked to raise her arms over her head
  - Expose lower part of the breast
  - Accentuate any tethering to the skin
- Patient is asked to put her hands on her hips and press in to contract pectoral
  - Any other areas of retraction can be visualized

4. Palpation
   ➡General principles

- **ALWAYS** ask for any pain
- Start palpation with the normal side
- Use fingers for palpation which are more sensitive
- Palpate along clock-face in 4 quadrants starting from nipple-areolar complex and radially outwards including the axillary tail
  - One hand retracts and stabilizes the breast while the other performs examination
  - Nipple discharge should be shown by the patient if possible
- Palpate for the axillary lymph nodes
  - Hold patient's elbow and allow her forearm to rest on your forearm and subsequently palpate with the other hand
  - Palpate for 5 major group of lymph nodes including anterior, posterior, medial, lateral and apical region
  - Comment on the number, site, size, consistency, tenderness and mobility

➡ Description of breast lump

- **Site**: Laterality (L/R) + Quadrant + Clock-face direction + Distance from nipple
- **Size**: Ruler can be used for precise measurement (\_cm by_cm)
- **Shape**: Oval/ Spherical
- **Edge**: Regular/ Irregular
- **Surface**: Smooth/ Nodular
- **Consistency**: Soft/ Firm/ Hard/ Rubbery/ Fluctuance
- **Tenderness**: Tender/ Non-tender
- **Mobility**: Skin fixation/ Skin tethering/ Muscle fixation
  - Skin fixation: Try to pick up the skin above the lump
  - Skin tethering: Lump behaves as if tied to skin by a piece of string/ Remains separate from skin and can be moved independently within certain limits/ Pulls the skin when move beyond limits
  - Muscle fixation: Move the lump in 2 perpendicular direction, then contract the pectoralis muscle by asking patient to press against her hip, move the lump again and the lesser the movement of lesion, the more likely it is fixed

[Image Description: There are two reddish-pink colored free body diagrams showing lumps underneath the skin. In the image on the left, the lump is pulled outside the arc, and the skin indents, indicating it is tethered. The image on the right shows a lump that cannot be moved without moving the skin, indicating it is fixed.]

➡ Completion of breast examination

- Examine lungs for pleural effusion
- Examine liver for hepatomegaly
- Examine bone for bone tenderness

VIII. Diagnosis (Triple assessment: Radiological)

1. Mammogram
   ➡Primary imaging modality for early detection of breast cancer

- NOT preferred in young women (age < 40) due to dense breast (low sensitivity)
  ➡2 standard views are performed including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO)
- Ensure adequate imaging of the relatively mobile inferior and lateral parts and relatively fixed upper and medial parts of the breast
- MLO view can be used to assess the axillary tail, axillary lymph nodes and the upper outer quadrant in details
  ➡ Mammography abnormalities
- Symmetry
  - Asymmetrical density suggests malignancy
- Architecture
  - Architectural distortion suggests malignancy
- Presence of lymph nodes
- Presence of breast mass
  - Spiculated (Stellate) mass suggests malignancy
  - Irregular shape suggests malignancy
- Presence of calcification (microcalcification < 0.5 mm)

➡Limitations

- Can only depict a mass as abnormal or suspicious but cannot make definitive diagnosis
- Obscuration of borders and extent of primary tumour by dense breast tissues

2. Ultrasound
   ➡General features

- Diagnostic follow-up of an abnormal screening mammogram
- First imaging study in young women or women who is pregnant or lactating
  ➡Limitations
- Operator-dependent
- Unable to detect microcalcifications
  Roles of ultrasound
- Determines whether the mass is solid or cystic
  - Simple cyst needs no further intervention due to low risk of cancer
  - Indeterminate cyst should be aspirated under ultrasound guidance
  - Intracystic mass should be aspirated or biopsied
- Characterize solid mass as benign or malignant
- Identify presence of a prominent vascular supply
  - Absence of flow on Doppler does not exclude possibility of malignancy
- Image-guided procedures including FNAC or core biopsy

➡Limitations

- Can only depict a mass as abnormal or suspicious but cannot make definitive diagnosis
- Obscuration of borders and extent of primary tumour by dense breast tissues

3. MRI breast
   ➡General features

- **High** sensitivity but **low** specificity
- Better characterization of soft tissues without radiation
- **NOT** routinely performed in the work-up of an undiagnosed breast mass
  ➡Indications of MRI
- Equivocal results from mammogram or ultrasound\*
- Assessment of patients with breast implants\*
- Identify patients with clinically occult tumour presenting with positive axillary LNs\*
- Suspected multicentric or bilateral malignancy especially invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)
- Determine extent of disease accurately especially with chest wall involvement which cannot
  be completely included on mammographic projections
- Identify extent of residual disease after excision which shows positive margins\*
- Pre-operative evaluation to improve surgical planning
  - Facilitate surgeons to better obtain clean margins in surgery
- Monitor results of neoadjuvant therapy
- Screening in high risk patients (genetic predisposition)
  ➡ MRI abnormalities (malignant features)
- Spiculated or irregular margins
- Rim-like enhancement
- Heterogenous internal enhancement
- Enhancing internal septa
- More rapid uptake of contrast is characteristic of malignant mass
  - Nearly all invasive breast carcinoma enhances on gadolinium-contrast MRI
  - Some benign lesions will also have enhancement

4. РЕТ CT scan
   ➡Detection of cancer metastasis

- Work-up of patients for metastasis in patients presenting with locally advanced (T3 or
  greater, N2/3, M0) or inflammatory breast cancer
  ➡Indication
- Patients presenting with symptoms of metastasis
- Patients with stage IIIA or above regardless of symptoms

5. Other imaging modalities
   ➡CXR for lung metastasis
   ➡USG abdomen for liver metastasis
   ➡Bone scan for bone metastasis
   ➡CT abdomen for liver, adrenal and ovarian metastasis
   ➡CT or MRI brain for brain metastasis

IX. Diagnosis (Triple assessment: Histopathological)

1. Background
   ➡Breast cancer receptor testing

- Newly diagnosed breast cancer must be tested for ER and PR expression and HER2 receptors overexpression for therapeutic and prognostic purposes
- ER and PR positivity
  - ER and PR in > 1% of tumour cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
- HER2 overexpression
  - Immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+) defined as uniform intense membrane staining of ≥ 10% of tumour cells by (OR)
  - Presence of HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH) defined as a ratio of HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0 (OR) HER2/ CEP17 ratio < 2.0 with average HER2 copy number ≥ 6 signals/cell

2. Biochemistry
   ➡HER2 = Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (erbB2 gene)
   ➡HER2 gene amplification is the primary mechanism for HER2 protein overexpression
   Protein found on surface of some cancer cells

- Attachment of epidermal growth factor to HER2 receptors stimulate proliferation of breast cancer cells
  ➡HER2 protein overexpression in breast cancer is associated with
- **Higher** risk of recurrence
- **Higher** mortality
- Relative resistance of hormonal treatment
- **Less** benefit from some forms of chemotherapy

3. Procedures of histopathological diagnosis
   ➡ Methods of biopsy for palpable lumps

- Fine needle aspiration (FNA)
- Core biopsy (Trucut biopsy)/ Vacuum-assisted biopsy
- Excisional biopsy
  ➡ Methods of biopsy required for **NON**-palpable lumps
- Image-guided biopsy required
  - Stereotactic (X-ray guidance)
  - Ultrasound (USG)
  - MRI-guided
- Choice depends on whether you can identify the lesion on imaging
  - Stereotactic guidance is better for calcifications
  - USG does not involve any radiation
- Hook-wire guided excision is required for **NON**-palpable lumps
  ➡ Procedures
- FNAC and core biopsy can be image-guided
  - Ultrasound guidance
  - Stereotactic mammography guidance
- Immunohistochemical staining can only be performed on core biopsy but **NOT** FNAC
  - Biopsy include core biopsy, incisional or excisional biopsy
- Performed on the invasive component of breast cancer tissue sample
  - In-situ component is always HER2 _+ve_ but not for the invasive component

|                   | FNAC                                                   | Core biopsy                                               |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Advantages**    | ➡Safe, simple and inexpensive                          | ➡Allows immunohistochemical staining for ER/ PR/ C-erB2\* |
|                   | ➡Smaller wound                                         |                                                           |
|                   | ➡Not painful without LA required                       | ➡Distinguish DCIS from invasive cancer\*                  |
|                   | ➡Distinguish solid from cystic mass immediately        |                                                           |
| **Disadvantages** | ➡Cannot perform immunohistochemical staining\*         | ➡More expensive                                           |
|                   | ➡Cannot distinguish between DCIS and invasive cancer\* | ➡Larger wound                                             |
|                   |                                                        | ➡Painful requiring LA                                     |

4. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for protein overexpression
   ➡ General features

- Evaluate for ER/ PR/ HER2 overexpression

| IHC Score |                              | Description                                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | Negative                     | ➡ No staining                                                  |
| 1+        |                              | ➡ Incomplete membrane                                          |
|           |                              | ➡ Weak staining within ≥ 10% of invasive cells                 |
| 2+        | Equivocal (Unsure)           | ➡ Circumferential membrane                                     |
|           | Reassessment by ISH required | ➡ Incomplete or weak/moderate staining ≥ 10% of invasive cells |
|           |                              | ➡ Circumferential membrane                                     |
|           |                              | ➡ Complete or intense staining < 10% of invasive cells         |
| 3+        | Positive                     | ➡ Circumferential membrane                                     |
|           |                              | ➡ Complete or intense staining ≥ 10% of invasive cells         |

5. In situ hybridization (ISH) for DNA/ gene amplification
   ➡ Different types of ISH

- Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
- Chromosome in situ hybridization (CISH)
- Silver enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH)
- Dual in situ hybridization (DISH)
  ➡ Mechanism of FISH
- Hybridization of fluorescent DNA probes to HER2 gene (red/ orange) and centromeric probe to chromosome 17 as control (CEP17) (green)
- **HER2 amplification** = HER2/ CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0 on average for 20 cells (OR)
- **HER2 amplification** = HER2/ CEP17 ratio < 2.0 with average HER2 copy number ≥ 6 signals/ cell
  ➡ Discordance of HER2 FISH results with histopathological appearance
- Order a reflex test using
  - Same specimen but IHC (OR)
  - Same specimen with alternative ISH (OR)
  - New specimen for IHC or ISH

[Flowchart titled "HER2 testing (invasive component) by validated dual-probe ISH assay." It starts with a box labeled "Batch controls and on-slide controls show appropriate hybridization". It then splits into two paths based on the HER2/CEP17 ratio: one for ≥ 2.0 and one for < 2.0.

For HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0, there are two scenarios:

1.  "Average HER2 copy number ≥ 6.0 signals/cell\*," resulting in an "ISH positive" outcome (green box).
2.  "Average HER2 copy number ≥ 4.0 signals/cell\*," also resulting in an "ISH positive" outcome (green box).

For HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0, there are two scenarios:

1.  "Average HER2 copy number ≥ 4.0 and < 6.0 signals/cell\*," resulting in an "ISH equivocal" outcome (yellow box).
2.  "Average HER2 copy number < 4.0 signals/cell\*," resulting in an "ISH negative" outcome (blue box).

All paths converge to a final instruction: "Must order a reflex test (same specimen using IHC), test with alternative ISH chromosome 17 probe, or order a new test (new specimen if available, ISH or IHC)."]

X. Diagnosis

1. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials

- Anemia
  ➡ LFT
- ↑ ALP in suspected bone metastasis
  ➡ RFT
- Hyponatremia in SIADH
  ➡ Serum CaPO4 level
- Malignant hypercalcemia

XI. Treatment

1. General approach
   ➡ Aims and objectives

- Locoregional control
  - Surgery
  - Radiotherapy
- Systemic control - Chemotherapy - Hormonal therapy - Targeted therapy
  ➡ Testing for chemotherapy
- Gene expression profile (21-gene OncotypeDx recurrence score (RS)) - Well-validated gene expression profile to predict chemotherapy for women with ER +ve breast cancer and either limited or no nodal involvement - Performed in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded of the excised invasive component of breast cancer - RS < 18: Low risk for recurrence + Benefit for chemotherapy will NOT outweigh the risk of side effects (Difference between tamoxifen alone and tamoxifen with chemotherapy is not statistically significant and thus benefit of chemotherapy is minimal) - RS 18-31: Intermediate risk or recurrence + Unclear whether benefits of chemotherapy outweigh the risk of side effects (Benefit of chemotherapy in intermediate-risk patients does not appear to be large) - RS > 31: High risk for recurrence + Benefit for chemotherapy likely to outweigh the risk of side effects (↓ Recurrence rate in distant sites by receiving tamoxifen with chemotherapy compared to simply receiving tamoxifen alone)
  ➡ Testing for hormonal therapy
- ER and PR positivity - ER and PR in > 1% of tumour cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
  ➡ Testing for targeted therapy
- HER2 overexpression
  - Immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+) defined as uniform intense membrane staining of ≥ 10% of tumour cells by (OR)

XII. Treatment (Oncological treatment)

1. Chemotherapy
   ➡Neoadjuvant chemotherapy

- Rationale
  - ↑ Operability by shrinking the tumour
  - ↑ Chance of undergoing BCT rather than mastectomy
- Indications
  - Locally advanced (T3 or Stage III) cancer
  - Limited node-positive (cN1) cancer
    - Conversion from cN1 to cN0 may potentially avoid ALND and convert into
      SLNB with regional nodal irradiation
  - HER 2 positive (OR) Triple-negative breast cancer
    - Patient is expected to receive chemotherapy at some point in their treatment
      course anyways and these subtypes are associated with higher likelihood of
      response
- Treatment regimen
  - Anthracycline-based: Doxorubicin + Cyclophosphamide + Paclitaxel (ACT)
    ➡Adjuvant chemotherapy
- Indicated in most cases unless for breast cancer in very early stages due to high potency and
  tolerability
- Rationale
  - ↓ Risk of recurrence
  - ↓ Breast cancer mortality rate
- Indications

| Types     | Indications                                                                                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ER/PR +ve | ➡ High recurrence score (RS) by Gene Expression Profiling test                                                             |
| HER2 -ve  | - High risk for recurrence + Benefit for chemotherapy likely to outweigh the risk of side effects                          |
|           | - ↓ Recurrence rate in distant sites by receiving tamoxifen with chemotherapy compared to simply receiving tamoxifen alone |
| ER/PR -ve | ➡Triple negative cancer                                                                                                    |
| HER2 -ve  | - Chemotherapy is the only form of treatment for these patients                                                            |
|           | - NOT candidates for hormonal therapy                                                                                      |
|           | - NOT candidates for targeted therapy                                                                                      |

- Treatment regimen

| Types                 | Indications                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Anthracycline-based\* | ➡**Regimen**: Doxorubicin + Cyclophosphamide + Paclitaxel (ACT)    |
| Taxane-based          | Regimen: Cyclophosphamide + Docetaxel                              |
|                       | Indicated in patients with history of cardiac disease              |
| Others                | ➡**Regimen**: Cyclophosphamide + Methotrexate + Fluorouracil (CMF) |
|                       | ➡Conventional regimen before the era of anthracyclines             |

2. Radiotherapy
   ➡X Neoadjuvant radiotherapy

- NO role of neoadjuvant radiotherapy in treatment of breast cancer
  ➡Adjuvant radiotherapy
- Rationale
  - Locoregional recurrence rate
  - Breast cancer mortality rate

| Types                                 | Description                                                                                                         |

4. Targeted therapy
   ➡Trastuzumab (Herceptin)

- IV infusion monthly for 12 months
- Indications in **ALL** patients with HER2 +ve breast cancer defined by
  - Immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+) defined as uniform intense membrane staining of ≥ 10% of tumour cells by (OR)
  - Presence of HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH) defined as a ratio of HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0 (OR) HER2/ CEP17 ratio < 2.0 with average HER2 copy number ≥ 6 signals/ cell
- Side effects - Cardiotoxicity
  ➡ Lapatinib
- **NOT** to be administered in adjuvant setting due to lack of benefits demonstrated in trials and thus no role in treatment of HER2 +ve breast cancer

5. Other medical therapy
   ➡Bisphosphonates/ Denosumab (RANKL monoclonal antibody)

- Osteoclast inhibitors
- Indicated for palliation in patients with bone metastasis
- Bisphosphonates improves symptoms of bone pain, reduces the risk of skeletal-related events (SRE) and improves QOL
  - Skeletal-related events (SREs) are defined as pathological fractures, spinal cord compression and hypercalcemia of malignancy
- Comparison between bisphosphonates **VS** Denosumab
  - Slight benefit for denosumab in terms of preventing skeletal-related events (SREs) and in analgesic effect in which this benefit is counterbalanced by the greater cost of denosumab
  - Another advantage of denosumab over zoledronic acid is that it is a quick monthly SC injection and not a prolonged IV infusion

XIII. Treatment (Surgical)

1. Breast conservation therapy (BCT) + Radiation therapy
   ➡Breast conservation surgery (BCS) = BCT + Post-operative irradiation

- BCT = Wide local excision/ Lumpectomy
  ➡Allows women with invasive breast cancer to preserve the breast with good cosmetic result
  ➡Associated with high risk of local recurrence
  Requires complete surgical removal of tumour with negative surgical margins and adjuvant
  radiotherapy is **COMPULSORY** in BCT to eliminate subclinical foci of disease in ipsilateral breast
  ➡Selection criteria
- < T2 stage meaning tumour size ≤ 5 cm in size without chest wall or skin involvement
- Appropriate tumour size-to-breast ratio
- Tumour is not multicentric
- Absence of metastasis
- Patient **MUST** agree to post-operative radiotherapy
  ➡Contraindication
- Multicentric disease with ≥ 2 primary tumours in separate quadrants of breast
  - Such that they cannot be encompassed in a single excision
- Large tumour size in relation to breast
  - Adequate resection would result in significant cosmetic alteration
- Diffuse malignant microcalcification on mammography
- Persistently positive margins after multiple attempts at re-excision
- Prior history of therapeutic irradiation that include a portion of affected breast - In which when combined with the proposed treatment would result in an excessively
  high total radiation dose to chest wall
- Pregnancy
  - Possible to perform in 3rd trimester so as to defer breast irradiation until after delivery

2. Mastectomy
   ➡Selection criteria

- BCT is contraindicated or unsuccessful
- Choice of patient
  - Desire to avoid post-operative radiation, further screening or biopsy
- Prophylaxis
  - For patients with hereditary breast and ovarian syndrome and patients with mutation of the breast cancer type 1 and 2 susceptibility gene (BRCA1 and BRCA2)

3. Breast reconstruction
   Types of breast reconstruction
   Autologous tissue reconstruction
   TRAM flap: Transverse rectus abdominal muscle
   Pedicle TRAM is normally supplied by superior epigastric artery
   Free TRAM require anastomosis to internal mammary or thoracodorsal artery
   Higher chance of hernia without abdominal muscles
   LD flap: Latissimus dorsi muscle
   DIEP flap: Deep inferior epigastric perforator
   Spares the muscle from graft harvest
   Indicated in athletes who would like to preserve abdominal muscles
   Complications rate is higher since the vessels are much smaller
   Prosthetic devices
   Devices include saline implants, silicone implants or tissue expanders
   One-stage: Permanent implant is inserted at the time of mastectomy
   Two-stage: Tissue expander is placed following mastectomy and gradually filled to

4. Management of lymph nodes
   ➡General approach

[Image: A flowchart illustrating the management of lymph nodes. The flow starts with "Clinical examination (PE + Axillary USG)". It branches into two paths based on whether the clinical node is positive (+ve) or negative (-ve). If clinically positive, the path leads to "FNAC/ Core needle biopsy", and further branches based on the pathological node being positive or negative. If clinically negative, the path leads to "Sentinel lymph node biopsy", and similarly branches based on the pathological node being positive or negative. Positive pathological nodes lead to "Axillary lymph node dissection". Negative pathological node dissection leads to Completion axillary lymph node dissection is NOT required. The positive pathological node dissection also leads to Planned radiation (e.g. BCS) and No planned radiation (e.g. Mastectomy). Planned radiation further branches based on 1-2 SLN being positive only leading to Completion axillary lymph node dissection is NOT required, and greater than 2 SLN being positive only. No planned radiation leads to Completion axillary lymph node dissection.]

| Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) | ➡Indications - Early breast cancer with clinical -ve nodes - Early stage such as T1 or T2 cancer - Method of staging the axilla with less morbidity than ALND - DCIS with planned mastectomy - DCIS usually do NOT require assessment of axillary nodes since it is theoretically not invasive and does not metastasize (confined to breast) - Reason for doing a SLNB is because the lymphatic drainage pattern will be permanently altered total mastectomy, thus impossible to accurately perform SLNB later if an invasive cancer is found unexpectedly in the mastectomy specimen - DCIS with suspicious features - DCIS that has clinically suspicion of harboring a synchronous invasive cancer include those > 5 cm or present with a palpable mass➡Contraindications - Absolute contraindications - Clinically +ve nodes (should be treated with ALND) - Inflammatory breast cancer (T4d) (should be treated with ALND) - Relative contraindications - Tumour size > 5 cm (T3) - Tumour with chest wall or skin involvement (T4a – T4c) - Previous breast or axillary procedures (due to disruption or alteration to the normal pattern of lymphatic drainage increase FN rate) |

➡ Technique

- Injection of blue dye (e.g. isosulfan or diluted methylene blue) or radioactive colloid around the tumour periphery at the palpable edge of biopsy cavity or into the subareolar plexus
- SLN identification by blue dye
  - Defined as the identification of any blue node or any non-blue node with blue afferent lymphatic
- SLN identification by radioactivity
  - Removal of the lymph node with most radioactivity as determined by gamma probe and an ex vivo count is obtained
  - Removal of subsequent lymph node follows "10% rule" in which all lymph nodes with > 10% of ex vivo count of the most radioactive lymph node should also be removed
- 2–3 sentinel lymph nodes are identified and majority stop SLNB after removing 3 (HK = 4 at maximum) sentinel lymph nodes

Axillary lymph
node dissection
(ALND)
➡ Indications

- Clinically +ve nodes
- Sentinel lymph node +ve nodes
  - All patients receiving mastectomy without radiation
  - > 2 +ve Sentinel lymph nodes in patients receiving BCT with radiation
- Inflammatory breast cancer (T4d)
  ➡ Extent of resection
- Level I and II axillary lymph nodes dissection is the standard of care
  - Typical dissection of these two level yield ≥ 10 lymph nodes
- Level III dissection is generally NOT necessary unless grossly +ve level III axillary lymph nodes are identified - Level III dissection increases morbidity significantly - Skip metastasis to level III lymph node is rare
  ➡ Surgical technique
- Preservation of structures including
  - Thoracodorsal artery and vein and nerve
  - Long thoracic nerves

# XIV. Prevention

1. Screening

➡ Standard screening guidelines (American College of Surgeons)

- **ALL** ages: **MONTHLY** self-examination
- Age 30
  - Yearly breast examination by doctors
- Age 40
  - Yearly breast examination by doctors
  - Mammogram every 2 years
- Age 50
  - Yearly breast examination by doctors
  - Mammogram every 1 year (annual)

➡ Guidelines in HK and other Asian countries

- Screening should be yearly
- Screening should start at age 40 and consider screening earlier within the 30s if high risk (i.e. when there is positive family history)
  - Women in HK tends to have breast cancer at a younger age around 40s
- USG should be considered as part of screening apart from mammogram
  - Younger women have denser breasts

2. Genetic testing

➡ Objectives

- Identify mutation that predisposes individual or family to breast cancer
- Potential benefits of finding one not inherited a predisposition must be weighed against potential harm of knowing one is at risk of breast cancer
- Potential harm from prophylactic measures such as mastectomy

➡ Criteria for referral for genetic counselling

- Personal history
  - Breast cancer diagnosed at age ≤ 50
  - Triple negative breast cancer
  - Male breast cancer (BRCA2 gene)
- Family history
  - ≥ 2 relatives with breast cancer one diagnosed at age ≤ 50
  - ≥ 3 relatives with breast cancer diagnosed at any age
  - Previous identified BRCA1 or 2 mutation in family

➡ Principles

- Undergo genetic testing on affected individual
- Only if a mutation is identified, then perform genetic testing on other unaffected family members to find out whether they have inherited this particular mutation
- NEVER attempt to do genetic testing in unaffected individual
  - Not all genes that predisposes breast cancer are identified
  - A -ve result from families where no mutation has been identified means nothing since other genes which are unknown at this moment can be involved in the predisposition to breast cancer

XV. Prognosis

1. Prognostic factors associated with poor prognosis
   Patient factors
   Extreme of age

- Younger or older age of diagnosis
  Smoking
  Tumour factors
  Large tumour size (T)
  Number of nodal involvement (N)
  Presence of metastatic disease (M)
  Poorly differentiated (Grade 3) histological grading
  High proliferative rate
- Ki67 nuclear antigen detected by immunohistochemistry
  Histological subtype
- Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)
- Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)
- Mixed ductal/lobular carcinoma
- Metaplastic carcinoma
- Micropapillary carcinoma
  Receptor status
- Absence of ER and PR expression
- HER2 overexpression

2. 5-year survival of breast cancer (HK)
   5-year survival rate according to different stages

- Stage I = 97.5%
- Stage II = 87.8%
- Stage III = 66.2%
- Stage IV = 19.3%

# Common signs and symptoms

## Dysphagia

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Subjective sensation of difficulty or abnormality of swallowing suggesting presence of organic abnormality in passage of solids or liquid from oral cavity to stomach
   ➡ Chief complaint ranges from inability to initiate a swallow to the sensation of solid or liquid being hindered during the passage through esophagus into stomach
2. Terminology
   ➡ Globus sensation

- Defined as a persistent or intermittent non-painful sensation of a lump or foreign body in the throat with occurrence of sensation between meals
- **ABSENCE** of dysphagia and odynophagia

3. Classification of dysphagia
   ➡ Classification according to phase of swallowing

- Oropharyngeal dysphagia
- Characterized by difficulty in initiating a swallow
- Accompanied by coughing, choking, nasopharyngeal regurgitation, aspiration and a sensation of residual food remaining in pharynx
- Esophageal dysphagia
- Characterized by difficulty swallowing several seconds after initiating a swallow
- Accompanied by sensation of food getting stuck in esophagus
  ➡ Classification according to mechanical and functional causes
- Mechanical causes
- Characterized by difficulty swallowing solid and then progressing to liquid
- Functional causes (Neuromuscular dysfunction)
- Characterized by difficult swallowing liquid

# IV. Diagnosis

1. History taking
   ➡ History of presenting illness (HPI)

- **Q:** Do you have problems initiating a swallow or do you feel food getting stuck a few seconds after swallowing?\*
  - Distinguish between oropharyngeal from esophageal dysphagia
- **Q:** Do you have problems swallowing solid, liquids or both?\*
  - Inability to swallow liquid suggest a motility disorder
  - Inability to swallow solid then progressing to liquid suggest a mechanical disorder
- **Q:** Have your symptoms progressed, remained stable or intermittent?
  - Rapidly progressive dysphagia suggest malignancy
  - Intermittent dysphagia suggest primary or secondary motility disorders
- **Q:** Can you point to where the food is getting stuck?
  - Pointing towards cervical region suggests oropharyngeal dysphagia
  - Pointing towards to suprasternal notch or retrosternal region suggests esophageal dysphagia
- Associated symptoms - Odynophagia and globus sensation - Coughing, choking and nasal regurgitation suggests oropharyngeal dysphagia - Choking suggests tracheo-esophageal fistula - Anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting suggests malignancy - Heartburn and regurgitation suggests GERD and its complications including erosive esophagitis, peptic stricture (due to reflux esophagitis) and CA esophagus - Vomiting fresh or old blood and anemic symptoms suggests CA esophagus - Hoarseness suggests invasion of recurrent laryngeal nerve due to locally advanced CA esophagus
  ➡ Medical history
- Diabetes mellitus (DM)
- Systemic sclerosis
- Sjogren syndrome
- Neuromuscular disorders - Stroke - Parkinson's disease - Myasthenia gravis - Multiple sclerosis - Muscle dystrophy
  ➡ Surgical history
- Previous surgery on esophagus, stomach, larynx or spine
  ➡ Drug history
- Radiotherapy
- Medications
  - Potassium chloride (KCI)
  - Bisphosphonates (e.g. Alendronate)
  - Antibiotics (e.g. Doxycycline)
  - Aspirin/ NSAIDS

325

2. Radiological tests
   ➡ Oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD) ± biopsy

- Direct visualization of lesion
- Both diagnostic and therapeutic - Tissue samples can be obtained for histology - Intervention such as dilation of an esophageal ring can be performed
  ➡ Barium swallow
- Indicated in patients with suspected proximal esophageal lesion, known complex tortuous
  stricture or -ve OGD but mechanical obstruction is still suspected - Suspected proximal lesions such as diverticulum may be susceptible to perforation
- Classical findings in achalasia - Aperistalsis - Delayed emptying - Dilatation of esophagus with narrowing of distal esophagus - Narrow EGJ with _"Bird-beak appearance"_ by contracted LES
  ➡ Fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES)
- Indicated in patients with suspected neuromuscular causes of oropharyngeal dysphagia
  - Optimal method of identifying structural abnormalities in oropharynx
- Based upon nasopharyngoscopy with the addition of functional assessment
- Involves flexible fibreoptic endoscope transnasally to visualize the laryngeal and
  pharyngeal structures
- Food and liquid bolus are given to patients so that both oropharyngeal structure and
  function can be evaluated during pharyngeal phase of swallowing
  ➡ Esophageal manometry
- Indicated in patients with -ve OGD or esophageal motility disorder is suspected
- Assessment of motor function of UES, LES and esophageal body
- Conventional manometry findings
  - Elevated resting LES pressure
  - Incomplete relaxation of lower esophageal sphincter (LES)
  - Aperistalsis in distal 2/3 of esophagus
- High-resolution manometry findings
  - Elevated integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) indicating impaired EGJ relaxation
  - Absence of normal peristalsis

V. Treatment

1. General management
   ➡ Resuscitate and stabilize the patient

- IV fluid to correct hemodynamic instability or electrolyte derangements
- NPO if patient cannot tolerate fluid
- Total parental nutrition (TPN) or feeding tube if patient cannot tolerate fluid
- Treatment of aspiration pneumonia with IV antibiotics

     - Dysphagia
     - Odynophagia
     - GI bleeding
     - Unexplained iron-deficiency anemia
     - Persistent vomiting
     - Palpable mass or lymphadenopathy

II. **Epidemiology**

1.  **General epidemiology**
    - 25% of patients with dyspepsia have underlying organic cause
    - 75% of patients have functional dyspepsia with no underlying cause identified during diagnostic evaluation

[Image Description: The image consists of the number 327 in the bottom right corner of the page.]

III. Etiology

1. Causes of dyspepsia
   ➡Functional dyspepsia (60%)

- Requires exclusion of other causes of dyspepsia
- Presence of one or more of the following for last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis
  - Postprandial fullness
  - Early satiety
  - Epigastric pain or burning
  - NO evidence of structural disease to explain the symptoms
- Supportive remarks
  - Postprandial epigastric pain or burning, epigastric bloating, excessive belching and nausea can also be present
  - Pain may be induced by or relived by ingestion of meal or may occur while fasting
  - Pain does not fulfill biliary pain criteria
  - Vomiting warrants consideration of another disorder
  - Heartburn is not a dyspeptic symptom but may often coexist
  - Symptoms that are relieved by evacuation of feces or gas should generally not be considered as part of dyspepsia

➡Peptic ulcer disease (PUD)

- Abdominal discomfort is usually centered in epigastrium but may localize to RUQ/LUQ
- Abdominal pain may radiate to the back although it is an atypical feature
- Associated with postprandial belching, epigastric fullness, early satiety, fatty food intolerance, nausea and vomiting

➡Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD)

- Associated with retrosternal burning pain (heartburn) and regurgitation

➡Esophageal/ Gastric/ Pancreatic/ Liver cancer

- Associated with anemia, fatigue and weight loss

➡Chronic pancreatitis

- Abdominal pain radiates to the back

➡Metabolic disturbances

- Hyperkalemia
- Hypercalcemia

➡Medications

- NSAIDS
- Glucocorticoids
- Ampicillin and erythromycin
- Iron supplements
- K+ supplements

328

IV. **Pathogenesis**

1. Pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia
   ➡Gastric motility and compliance

- Delayed or rapid gastric emptying
- Antral hypomotility
- Gastric dysrhythmia
- Impaired gastric accommodation in response to a meal
  ➡Visceral hypersensitivity
- Characterized by lower threshold of pain in the presence of normal gastric compliance
  ➡H. pylori infection
- H. pylori may cause altered SM dysfunction due to induction of inflammatory response or by
  initiation of an antibody response
  ➡Altered gut microbiome
- Altered gut microbiome with increased duodenal eosinophilia associated with functional
  dyspepsia

V. **Diagnosis**

1. History taking
   ➡History of presenting illness

- Radiation of pain to back
  - Chronic pancreatitis
  - Peptic ulcer disease
- Retrosternal burning pain (heartburn), regurgitation and cough
  - Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Anorexia, weight loss, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia - Esophageal cancer
  ➡Medical history
- Pancreatitis
  ➡Family history
- Pancreatitis
- GI malignancy
  ➡ Drug history
- NSAIDS
- Glucocorticoids

2. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Pallor
- Jaundice
- Lymphadenopathy
  ➡Abdominal examination
- Epigastric tenderness
- Palpable abdominal mass
- Ascites

329

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Anemia
  ➡ Electrolyte profile
- Hyperkalemia
- Hypercalcemia
  ➡ LFT

4. Radiology tests
   ➡ Endoscopy with biopsy

- Early upper GI endoscopy should be performed in patient **WITH** alarming features as gold standard for establish the specific cause of upper abdominal pain
- Biopsy of stomach should be obtained to rule out H. pylori infection and patient should be given eradication therapy in addition to treatment based on underlying diagnosis

➡Urea breath test

- Testing for H. pylori in patient **WITHOUT** alarming features based on the rationale that H. pylori is an etiological factor in peptic ulcer disease
- H. pylori eradication if +ve and PPI if -ve

➡Stool antigen assay

- Testing for H. pylori in patient **WITHOUT** alarming features based on the rationale that H. pylori is an etiological factor in peptic ulcer disease
- H. pylori eradication if +ve and PPI if -ve

330

VI. Treatment

1. Treatment approach
   ➡Provide education and reassurance that the condition is benign and non-life threatening
   ➡Treatment approach to functional dyspepsia

- PPIs (OR) Triple therapy → TCA → Prokinetics

2. Medical therapy
   ➡Triple therapy (PPI-based or bismuth-based)

- H. pylori eradication
- PPI + Clarithromycin + Amoxicillin
- PPI + Clarithromycin + Metronidazole
  ➡Anti-secretory agents
- PPIs are considered in patients with functional dyspepsia and no evidence of H. pylori, patients with persistent symptoms after eradication of H. pylori or as empirical therapy if prevalence of H. pylori is low
- Example: PPIs/ H2-receptor antagonist/ Antacids
  ➡Tricyclic antidepressants
- Considered in patients with functional dyspepsia and persistent symptoms despite PPI therapy for 8 weeks
- Example: Amitriptyline/ Desipramine
  ➡Prokinetic agents
- Abnormal gastric emptying provides the basis for treatment with prokinetics
- Considered in patients in whom eradication of H. pylori and a trial of PPI and TCA has failed
- Example: Metoclopramide/ Domperidone/ Tegaserod (Partial 5-HT3 antagonist)
  ➡Anti-nociceptive agents
- Impact central processing of pain and decrease visceral hypersensitivity that has been associated with functional dyspepsia
- Example: Opioid agonists/ 5-HT3 antagonist

# VII. Case study

## Case 1

A 35-year-old woman complained of on and off epigastric discomfort for 5 years, with worsening symptoms in the past 2 months. The discomfort occurred intermittently throughout day and night. It was slightly worse after meals and associated with belching, abdominal distension and early satiety (fullness). There was no recent weight loss or dysphagia. The appetite was poor recently due to epigastric distension. Because of worsening symptoms in the last 2 months, she attended her family doctor. A blood test was suggested the presence of H. pylori infection. She was given 1 week of triple therapy. A urea breath test was performed 1 week earlier (4 weeks after completing her drug therapy course) and was negative. Her family doctor then arranged an upper endoscopy and an abdominal USG examination and both were normal. However, she continued having epigastric pain and was referred for a second opinion.

Physical examination shows she was a well-nourished lady with normal BP and pulse. Abdominal examination revealed mild epigastric tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness. There was no organomegaly and the bowel sounds were active. Other systems were normal.

**Q1: What is the likely diagnosis?**

➡ Most likely diagnosis = Functional dyspepsia

- Commonest cause of epigastric discomfort
- Common presentation in the Chinese
- Estimated population prevalence of 10-20%
  ➡Functional dyspepsia has to be distinguished from uninvestigated dyspepsia
- Uninvestigated dyspepsia refers to initial presentation to family doctors
  - GERD
  - Peptic ulcers
  - Esophageal and gastric cancer
  - Gallbladder and related biliary disorder
  - Pancreatitis
  - Pancreatic cancer

**Q2: How is function dyspepsia diagnosed?**

➡ Diagnosed of exclusion by investigations

- Blood tests
- Upper endoscopy
- Ultrasound (USG)

332

Q3: How common is H. pylori infection and how should it be diagnosed?

➡H. pylori infect ion affects about 50% of population in China

- Prevalence in developed countries = 10 - 40%
- Prevalence in developing countries = 40 - 80%
  ➡Transmission route is oral-oral or fecal-oral route
  ➡Occurs mostly in childhood
  ➡Risk factors
- Low socio-economic status
- Overcrowding
- Poor social hygiene
  ➡Diagnosis of H. pylori infection
- Non-invasive method
  - Urea breath test
  - Stool antigen ELISA test
  - Serology ELISA antibody test
- Invasive method (Gastric antral biopsy by upper endoscopy)
  - Rapid urease test
  - Histological examination
  - Bacterial culture
  - Drug sensitivity testing

Q4: What issues are pertinent to diagnosing and monitoring of treatment success?

➡All tests except serology and whole blood antibody tests are affected by recent intake of PPIs, antibiotics
and bismuth compounds

- FN results due to suppression of bacterial growth to below diagnostic threshold
- H2-receptor antagonist and antacids do NOT affect the test
  ➡Post-treatment testing and monitoring
- Post-treatment testing should be done at least 4 weeks after stopping all drugs that can affect the
  test results
- Antibody test should not be used for post-treatment testing since antibody titres can remain high
  for 6-12 months even after successful treatment

333

# Common signs and symptoms

# Upper GI bleeding

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Upper GI tract is the GIT proximal to ligament of Treitz (duodenojejunal flexure)
   ➡ Patients with upper GI bleeding commonly presents with hematemesis and melena

- Hematemesis refers to vomiting of red blood or coffee-ground like material
  - Anatomical extent of hematemesis = Up to ligament of Treitz (DJ junction)
  - Frank bloody emesis suggests moderate to severe bleeding that may be ongoing
  - Coffee-ground emesis suggests more limited bleeding
- Melena refers to passing out tarry (black) loose stools
  - Anatomical extent of melena = From nasopharynx to proximal colon
  - Usually due to upper GI bleeding
  - Loose stool since blood in GIT causes intestinal hurry
  - Require exclusion of other causes including iron or bismuth ingestion (formation of bismuth sulphide)
- Hematochezia refers to fresh red blood in stool
  - Usually due to lower GI bleeding
  - Can also occur with massive upper GI bleeding

➡ Features of ongoing bleeding

- Hematemesis
- Hematochezia
- Fresh PR bleeding
- Fresh blood aspirated from NG tube
- Tachycardia

➡ Risk factors of recurrent bleeding

- Age > 60
- Coagulopathy
- Hb < 8.0 g/dL on presentation
- Shock on presentation
- Require blood transfusion
  334

II. Differential diagnosis

1. Common causes in descending order
   ➡Peptic or duodenal ulcers

- 4 Major risk factors = **H. pylori** + **NSAIDS** + **Stress** + **Excess gastric acid**
  - H. pylori: Infects the superficial gastric mucosa and disrupts the mucous layer making the mucosa more susceptible to acid damage
  - NSAIDs: Predispose to ulceration in GIT due to systemic prostaglandin inhibition
  - Stress: Stress ulcers are common in patients who are hospitalized for life-threatening non-bleeding illnesses
  - Excess gastric acid: Leads to intramural acidosis, cell death and ulceration
    ➡Esophagogastric varices
- Complication of portal hypertension
- Usually develops in patients with liver cirrhosis
- Esophagogastric varices or ectopic varices (from intestine)
  ➡Esophagitis (Severe or erosive)/ Esophageal ulcers
- Patients with erosive esophagitis often have a history of GERD
- Risk factors include obesity, GERD, infections (e.g. HSV and Candida), medications (e.g. NSAIDs, tetracycline, bisphosphonates) and irradiation for malignancy
  ➡Gastritis/ Duodenitis (Severe or erosive)
- Inflammation-associated mucosal injury
- Bleeding from gastritis or duodenitis is typically self-limited
- Can be drug-induced (aspirin/ NSAIDs), alcohol-induced and stress-induced
- Diagnosis is made exclusively by endoscopic evaluation of mucosa
  ➡Portal hypertensive gastropathy
- Complication of portal hypertension
- Mucosa is friable and bleeding presumably occurs when ectatic vessels rupture
  ➡Angiodysplasia
- Dilated tortuous submucosal vessels
- Often originates from stomach and duodenum in the upper GIT
- Diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopic evaluation
  ➡Upper GI malignancy
- Esophageal/ Gastric/ Duodenal cancer are uncommon causes of upper GI bleeding and usually presents with more constitutional symptoms
  ➡Mallory-Weiss syndrome (Esophageal tear)
- Longitudinal mucosal laceration (intramural dissections) in distal esophagus and proximal stomach (gastroesophageal junction) that are usually associated with forceful retching
- Lacerations lead to bleeding from submucosal arteries
- Usually secondary to sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure

[Image Description: The image shows a handwritten list of differential diagnoses for gastrointestinal issues. The main heading is "II. Differential Diagnosis," followed by a numbered list of common causes in descending order. Each diagnosis is preceded by a right-pointing arrow symbol. Sub-bullets detail specific factors related to each diagnosis, such as risk factors, complications, and characteristics. Key terms are bolded for emphasis.]

2. Less common causes
   ⇒ Vascular lesions - Dieulafoy's lesion - Dilated aberrant submucosal vessel that erodes the overlying epithelium in the absence of primary ulcer - Usually located in proximal stomach along lesser curvature or near the esophagogastric junction - Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) - Known as "watermelon stomach" as endoscopic appearance shows longitudinal rows of flat, reddish stripes radiating from pylorus into antrum

⇒ Trauma or iatrogenic - Aorto-enteric fistula - Medical emergency with high mortality rate - Arises from direct communication between aorta and GIT - Secondary to placement of a prosthetic abdominal aortic vascular graft and should be suspected in patients with AAA repair - 3rd or 4th portion of duodenum is the most common site for aorto-enteric fistula - Cameron lesions - Erosions or ulcers occurring in the sac of hiatal hernia

⇒ Hemobilia - Bleeding from hepatobiliary tract - Should be considered in patients with history of hepatic parenchymal or biliary tract instrumentation such as percutaneous or transjugular liver biopsy

⇒ Hemosuccus pancreaticus - Bleeding from pancreatic duct - Most often found in patients with chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocysts or pancreatic tumours

III. Diagnosis

1. History taking
   ⇒ History of presenting illness - Nature, rate and duration of bleeding - Severity of bleeding - Anemic symptoms (Pallor/ Palpitation/ Cold and clammy extremities) - Orthostatic hypotension - Associated symptoms - Epigastric, RUQ pain → Peptic ulcer disease - Dysphagia, odynophagia, GERD → Esophagitis/ Esophageal ulcer - Dysphagia, early satiety, weight loss and cachexia → Malignancy - Vomiting, coughing prior to hematemesis → Mallory-Weiss tear - Jaundice, abdominal distension, anorexia, fatigue → Varices/ Portal hypertension gastropathy

2. Physical examination
   ➡ Vital signs

- Temperature
  - Clotting enzymes function best at normal temperature
  - Prevent hypothermia in patients with GI bleeding
- Blood pressure
  - Postural hypotension indicates at least 20% reduction in blood volume
  - Hypotension indicates severe bleeding
- Pulse
  - Tachycardia indicates severe bleeding
  - Bradycardia can also occur in severe bleeding due to vagal slowing of the heart
- Respiratory rate
- Consciousness level - Confusion, drowsiness and coma
  ➡ Abdominal examination
- Stigmata of chronic liver diseases
- Abdominal tenderness
- Rebound tenderness
- Guarding
- Hepatosplenomegaly
- Ascites
  ➡ Digital rectal examination (DRE)
- Stool color (Melena/ Iron-colored stool)

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials - Normocytic or microcytic anemia - Hb will often be at normal baseline as the patient is losing whole blood - Hb will decline as blood is diluted by fluid during resuscitation - Thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis - Thrombocytopenia due to massive blood loss - Thrombocytosis due to reactive thrombocytosis
   ➡ Type and cross-match - Indicated for hemodynamically unstable patients
   ➡ Clotting profile - Look for coagulopathy - Obtain baseline before performing endoscopy
   ➡ LFT - Look for chronic liver diseases
   ➡ RFT - Look for chronic renal diseases - Low Hb is expected in chronic renal diseases and thus CBC should be interpreted with caution - ↑ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)-to-creatinine (> 20:1) or urea-to-creatinine ratio (>100:1) - Acute upper GI bleeding can lead to digestion of blood (Hb) in small bowel and decreased renal perfusion
   ➡ Nasogastric lavage - Indicated if source of bleeding is unclear - Clean the stomach prior to endoscopy

338

4. Radiological tests
   ➡Oesophageal-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD)

IV. Treatment

1. General management
   ➡Nil by mouth (NPO)
   ➡Risk stratification applying Rockall score or Blatchford score
   ➡Arrange early upper endoscopy within 24 hours after initial stabilization
   ➡Insert peripheral large bore IV lines or a central venous line
   ➡Nasogastric (NG) tube

- If massive hematemesis or signs suggestive of GI obstruction
  ➡Cuffed endotracheal (ET) tube
- Maintain airway patency in suspected compromised respiratory or airway condition
- Prevent aspiration if massive hematemesis
  ➡Close monitoring of vital signs, cardiac rhythm, nasogastric output and urine output
- Cardiac monitor to prevent volume overload in setting of fluid resuscitation or blood
  transfusion in patients with congestive heart failure
  ➡Withhold anti-coagulants and anti-platelet drugs
- Weigh against thrombotic risk of an individual patient before reversal of anti-coagulation
  ➡O2 supplementation
  ➡Treatment of hypotension and hemodynamically instability
- Rapid bolus infusion of isotonic crystalloid
- Blood transfusion
  - Hb < 7 g/dL in low-risk patients
  - Hb < 9 g/dL in high-risk patients (e.g. elderly, CAD)
    ➡Treatment of bleeding
- Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for coagulopathy
- Platelets for platelet dysfunction or thrombocytopenia

2. Medications
   ➡Proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) (_IV_)

- Pantoprazole (_OR_) Esomeprazole
- Pre-endoscopic PPI is recommended if early endoscopy within 24 hours cannot be arranged
- Post-endoscopic PPI is recommended after endoscopic treatment of patients with actively bleeding ulcer, ulcer with adherent clot resistant to vigorous irrigation
- Rationale
  - Acid suppression and reduce rebleeding rate
    ➡Antibiotics (_IV_)
- Amoxicillin-clavulanate (_OR_) Levofloxacin
- Recommended in all cirrhotic patients with GI bleeding
  ➡Tranexamic acid
- **NOT** recommended due to insufficient evidence

3. Surgery
   ➡Peptic ulcer disease

- Gastrectomy with Billroth I/II reconstruction
- Truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty
  - Truncal vagotomy to denervate the stomach and reduce gastric acid secretion
  - Pyloroplasty refers to widening the opening of the antrum and duodenum to facilitate the passage of gastric content as pyloric muscles will undergo spasm after truncal vagotomy

# Common signs and symptoms

## Lower GI bleeding

I. Overview

1. General features

   ➡ Lower GI tract is the GIT distal to ligament of Treitz (duodenojejunal flexure)

   ➡ Patients with lower GI bleeding commonly presents with hematochezia
   - Hematochezia refers to passage of bright red blood or blood clots per rectum
     - Bright red colored if originating from left colon
     - Dark or maroon colored mixed with stool if originating from right colon
   - Hematochezia can occur in patients with massive upper GI (e.g. small bowel) bleeding
   - Melena can also be present rarely in patients with right-sided colon bleeding

II. Differential diagnosis

1. Common causes of lower GI bleeding

   ➡ Diverticular bleeding (15 - 55%) (most common) (NOT acute diverticulitis)
   - Sac-like protrusion of colonic wall
   - Penetrating vessels are draped over the dome of diverticulum as diverticulum forms and the vessels are separated from bowel lumen only by mucosa
     - Weakness of the artery predispose to rupture into bowel lumen

   - Bleeding is usually painless with mild abdominal discomfort and cramping due to colonic spasm from intraluminal blood
   - Risk factors include advanced age, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, IHD, chronic renal insufficiency and use of aspirin or NSAIDs
   - Remarks
     - Right-sided diverticula are common in Asians compared to Western countries and have a higher risk of hemorrhage
     - Bleeding is a rare complication of this disease but its high prevalence explains why it is the most common cause of lower GI bleeding
     - Diverticular bleeding typically occurs in the absence of diverticulitis

   ➡ Angiodysplasia (most common in age > 65)
   - Dilated tortuous submucosal vessels
   - Walls of blood vessels are composed of endothelial cells that lack smooth muscles
   - Acquired conditions associated with degeneration of vascular walls from aging
   - Often originates from cecum or ascending colon in the lower GIT
   - Bleeding is usually occult manifested by FOBT +ve stools are iron deficiency anemia but can be overt presenting with hematochezia or melena
   - Bleeding is venous in origin and tends to be less massive than diverticular bleeding

   ➡ Hemorrhoids (most common in age < 50)
   - Dilated submucosal veins in the anus above (internal) or below (external) dentate line
   - Usually asymptomatic but can present with painless hematochezia, thrombosis, strangulation or pruritus

[Image Description: This page is an excerpt from a medical textbook, detailing common signs and symptoms related to lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. It's divided into sections, beginning with "Overview", listing general features such as the definition of the lower GI tract and how patients commonly present with hematochezia, further described as the passage of bright red blood or clots. Then, it proceeds to "Differential diagnosis," highlighting common causes such as diverticular bleeding and angiodysplasia, along with their characteristics and risk factors, finally ending with Hemorrhoids, dilated submucosal veins, their origin and symptomatology.]

343

III. Diagnosis

1. History taking

-     ➡ Colitis

  - Infectious/ Ischemic/ Radiation colitis
-     ➡Inflammatory bowel disease

  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has similar management
  - Should not be misdiagnosed as infectious or ischemic colitis since therapy is different
-     ➡Colorectal cancer (CRC)

  - Less common but serious cause of hematochezia
  - Bleeding occurs due to overlying erosion or ulceration
-     ➡Anorectal disorders

  - Includes rectal ulcers, rectal varices, anal ulcers, anal fissures and Dieulafoy's lesions
  - Rectal varices are associated with portal hypertension
-     ➡Radiation telangiectasia and proctitis

  - Radiation therapy of abdominal and pelvic cancers such as cervical or prostate cancer can lead to lower GI bleeding as complication of radiation damage
  - Acute radiation injury often occurs within 6 weeks of therapy
-     Following biopsy or polypectomy

  - Acute bleeding due to involvement of an underlying artery or inadequate coagulation of polyp stalk
  - Delayed bleeding due to sloughing of the coagulated eschar
-     ➡Massive bleeding from small bowel sources

  - Meckel's diverticulitis
  - Crohn's disease
  - Angiodysplasia
  - Hemangioma
-     ➡History of presenting illness

  - Nature, rate and duration of bleeding
    - Blood mixed with stool = Right-sided colon (feces is still fluid)
    - Blood streak on stool = Left-sided colon (feces quite solid)
    - Blood on towel paper = Anorectal conditions
  - Severity of bleeding
    - Anemic symptoms (Pallor/ Palpitation/ Cold and clammy extremities)
    - Orthostatic hypotension
  - Associated symptoms
    - Abdominal pain ➡ Ischemic or infectious colitis/ Perforated peptic ulcer
    - Painless hematochezia ➡ Hemorrhoids/ Diverticular disease
    - Change in bowel habits ➡ Colorectal cancer
-     ➡ Drug history
      - Aspirin
      - NSAIDS
      - Anti-platelets
      - Anti-coagulants
  344

2. Physical examination
   ➡ Vital signs

- Temperature
  - Clotting enzymes function best at normal temperature
  - Prevent hypothermia in patients with GI bleeding
- Blood pressure and pulse
  - Hemodynamic stability
- Respiratory rate
  ➡ Assessment of hemodynamic stability
- Tachycardia
- Postural hypotension
- Supine hypotension
  ➡ Abdominal examination
- Abdominal tenderness
- Rebound tenderness
- Guarding
- Signs of chronic liver diseases
- Hepatosplenomegaly
- Ascites
  ➡ Digital rectal examination
- Stool color

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials

- Normocytic or microcytic anemia
  - Hb will often be at normal baseline as the patient is losing whole blood
  - Hb will decline as blood is diluted by fluid during resuscitation
    ➡ Type and cross-match
- Indicated for hemodynamically unstable patients
  ➡ Clotting profile
- Look for coagulopathy
  ➡ LFT
- Look for chronic liver diseases and liver metastasis
- Albumin to assess nutritional status
  ➡ RFT
- Look for chronic renal diseases
  - Low Hb is expected in chronic renal diseases and thus CBC should be interpreted with caution
- Normal blood urea nitrogen (BUN)-to-creatinine (< 20:1) or urea-to-creatinine ratio (<100:1)
  - Acute lower GI bleeding with normal renal perfusion should not have an elevated BUN-to-creatinine or urea-to-creatinine ratio in contrast to upper GI bleeding
    ➡ Stool tests
- Look for Amoeba histolytica suggestive of amoebic dysentery
- Look for Clostridium difficile suggestive of pseudomembranous colitis (severe inflammation of the inner lining of bowel)

345

4. Radiological tests

**Angiodysplasia**

[Image of Ischemic colitis: Two-part endoscopic view. The left part shows a dark, necrotic area in the colonic wall. The text overlay says "Necrosis of Colonic Wall". The right part shows an ischemic ulcer, indicated by the text "Edematous Folds" and "Ischemic Ulcer".]

**Ischemic colitis**

[Image of Ulcerative colitis: Endoscopic view of the colon with extensive ulceration. Text overlay describes "Extensive ulceration of the mucosa" and "surface is irregular, friable, erythematous, with loss of normal vascular markings".]

**Ulcerative colitis**

➡ Colonoscopy

- Advantages
  - Localization of bleeding is accurate regardless of the etiology or rate of bleeding
  - Ability of collect pathological specimen for diagnosis
  - Ability of potential therapeutic intervention
- Disadvantages - Require bowel preparation and poor visualization in unprepared colon - Risks of sedation in an acutely bleeding patient
  ➡ Proctoscopy
- Exclusion of bleeding from anorectal disorders
  ➡Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD)
- Indicated if bleeding source is not identified in colonoscopy
  ➡CT angiography
- Widely available, fast and minimally invasive for localized of active hemorrhage
- Lacks therapeutic capability, requires radiation exposure and utilize IV contrast

346

➡Radionuclide imaging

- Screening tool to confirm bleeding prior to angiography in non-life threatening cases
- Technetium-99m (99m-Tc) sulfur colloid
  - IV injection of radionuclide labelled colloid and look for evidence of extravasation
  - Detection requires active bleeding and cannot detect intermittent bleeding
  - Poor localization of bleeding site
  - No therapeutic value
- Technetium-99m (99mTc) pertechnetate-labeled autologous RBC
  - IV injection of radionuclide labelled RBC and obtain abdominal images every few hours up to 24 hours and look for evidence of extravasation
  - Able to detect obscure intermittent bleeding of 0.1 – 0.5 mL/min
  - Poor localization of bleeding site
  - No therapeutic value

➡Angiography

- Selective catheterization of SMA and subsequently IMA and celiac vessels directly and look for evidence of extravasation
- Detection requires active bleeding of 0.5 – 1.0 mL/min
- Localization of bleeding site is very accurate
- Allows therapeutic capability by injection of intra-arterial vasopressin or transcatheter embolization

IV. Treatment

1. General management
   ➡Nil by mouth (NPO) if an OGD is required
   ➡Insert peripheral large bore IV lines or a central venous line
   ➡Close monitoring of vital signs, cardiac rhythm, nasogastric output and urine output
   - Cardiac monitor to prevent volume overload in setting of fluid resuscitation or blood transfusion in patients with congestive heart failure
     ➡Withhold anti-coagulants and anti-platelet drugs
   - Weigh against thrombotic risk of an individual patient before reversal of anti-coagulation
     ➡O2 supplementation
     ➡Treatment of hypotension and hemodynamically instability
   - Rapid bolus infusion of isotonic crystalloid
   - Blood transfusion - Hb < 7 g/dL in low-risk patients - Hb < 9 g/dL in high-risk patients (e.g. elderly, CAD)
     ➡Treatment of bleeding
   - Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for coagulopathy
   - Platelets for platelet dysfunction or thrombocytopenia

347

2. Treatment of diverticulosis
   ➡Endoscopic therapy

- 4-quadrant submucosal injection of adrenaline in bleeding diverticular vessel
- Bipolar coagulation in visualized non-bleeding diverticular vessel
  ➡ Angiography
- Embolization or infusion of vasopressin by localizing site of bleeding
- Alternative to colonoscopy for treatment in cases where bleeding site cannot be identified with colonoscopy
  ➡Surgical resection
- Reserved for patients in which bleeding does not stop spontaneously and cannot be controlled with endoscopic or angiographic therapy
- Colonoscopy or angiography should be performed to accurately localize bleeding site
- Segmental colectomy with localization of bleeding sites
- Subtotal colectomy without localized of bleeding sites

3. Treatment of angiodysplasia
   ➡ Endoscopic therapy

- Argon plasma coagulation (APC)
  - Most common and successful method to treat angiodysplasia
  - Use of high-frequency energy transmitted to tissue by ionized gas
- Electrocoagulation
  - Use of bipolar probe or heater probe
- Injection sclerotherapy - Inject sclerosant to obliterate lesions
  ➡ Angiography
- Embolization or infusion of vasopressin by localizing site of bleeding
- Reserved for patients with life-threatening bleeding that are not surgical candidates or for those require localization of lesions before surgery
  ➡Surgical resection
- Definitive therapy for lesions that have been clearly identified as source of bleeding
- Reserved for patients with large transfusion requirements or life-threatening hemorrhage from a clearly identified site

# Gastrointestinal Disease

## Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD)

I. Overview

III. Pathogenesis

1. Pathophysiology
   ➡ Abnormalities in lower esophageal sphincter (LES)

- Normal physiology
  - Contracted normally by lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone
  - Relaxation only during swallowing
- Pathology
  _ ↓ Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone
  _ Inappropriate sphincter relaxation \* Permits reflux when intra-abdominal pressure increases

- Pregnancy
- Obesity
- Chronic cough
- Constipation
  ➡ Delayed esophageal and gastric clearance
- Defective esophageal and gastric peristaltic activity
- Increase time of exposure to acid
  ➡ Hiatus hernia
- Almost all patients who develop esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus and peptic strictures have hiatus hernia
- Type 1 = Sliding; Type 2 = Rolling; Type 3 = Mixed
- Mechanism
  - ↓ Pressure gradient between abdominal and thoracic cavity
  - Pressure no longer pinches the esophageal hiatus
  - Disappearance of oblique angle between esophagus and cardia

IV. Clinical manifestations

V. Diagnosis

1. Biochemical tests
   ➡ Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) testing

- Constitutes a therapeutic trial and is conducted over 1 - 4 weeks
- Patients responding favorably are likely to have a reflux component to their symptoms

➡ Esophageal manometry

- Measure the pressure inside the esophagus
- Performed to locate LES before ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring
- Evaluate location and function of LES and esophageal body peristalsis
  - Characteristics of a manometrically abnormal LES
    - Resting pressure < 6 mmHg
    - Overall length < 2 cm or an abdominal length < 1 cm
- Exclude achalasia, scleroderma and diffuse esophageal spasm
- **NOT** recommended in patients with uncomplicated GERD
- Indications
  - Diagnosis of GERD is doubtful\*
  - Planning for endoscopic or surgical therapy\*
- Procedures
  - Insert pressure-sensitive tube through nose down into esophagus
  - Patients is asked to swallow to allow measurement of the pressure generated by muscle contractions

➡ Ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring

- General features
  - GOLD STANDARD
  - Inconvenient, uncomfortable and not widely available
  - Seldom used as 1st line diagnostic tool
  - Sensitivity is around 80 – 90%
- Indications
  - Diagnosis of GERD is doubtful\*
  - Planning for endoscopic or surgical therapy\*
  - Persistent symptoms despite PPIs (define with or without continued acid exposure)
  - Persistent symptoms despite reflux surgery
- Mechanism
  - Insertion of slim catheter with radiotelemetry pH-sensitive probe 5 cm above EGJ

- Interpretation
  - pH < 4 for more than 6 – 7% of stud time is diagnostic of reflux diseases
- Remarks
  - Catheter-free pH system (BRAVOTM system) is a newly developed esophageal pH monitoring technique
    [Image of a page break indicating the end of the current page and the start of page number 353]

2. Radiological tests

# Treatment

1. Treatment regimen

[Flowchart illustrating the treatment regimen for acid reflux. The chart starts with a rectangular box labeled "Symptoms". Below that, another rectangular box is labeled "Antacids/alginates". A rectangular box below is labeled "Proton pump inhibitor at full dose". The next step depends on the response to the proton pump inhibitor. If there is a "Good response", the next step is a box labeled "Proton pump inhibitor at maintenance dose" which leads to "H2-receptor antagonists", which then leads to "Antacids". If there is a "Poor response or side-effects", the next step is either "Reconsider diagnosis" or "Consider pH monitoring". From the "Reconsider diagnosis" box, there is an arrow leading to "Normal". From the "Consider pH monitoring" box, there is an arrow leading to "Positive". "Normal" leads back to "Reconsider diagnosis". "Positive" leads to "Fundoplication".]

2. Non-pharmacological treatment

➡Behavioral modifications

- Weight loss
- Smoking cessation
- Avoidance of tight belts or corsets
- Remains upright after meal for at least 1 hour
- Elevation of bed head to improve nocturnal symptoms

➡Dietary modifications

- Low-fat diet
- Avoidance of alcoholism
- Avoidance of chocolate, spicy food, coffee
- Eat small frequent meals
- Avoidance of late meals (eating later than 2-3 hours before bedtime)

3. Medical treatment
   ➡Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)

- Only changes acidic reflux into non-acidic reflux (change the pH) but NOT prevent reflux
  - Relieves heartburn and esophagitis by reducing acidity
  - Regurgitation usually remains uncorrected since the reflux mechanism is not affected and this will require anti-reflux surgery
- Empirical treatment for patients with typical GERD symptoms
- Patients with chest pain suspected due to GERD should exclude ischemic heart disease before initiation of empirical PPIs
- ALL PPIs except dexlansoprazole should be administered 30 mins - 1 hour before meals (before gastric acid is produced) to assure maximal efficacy
- Indications
  - Mild (LA Grade A - B) or Severe (LA Grade C - D) esophagitis
  - Non-erosive GERD (NERD)
- Example: Omeprazole/ Esomeprazole/ Lansoprazole/ Pantoprazole/ Rabeprazole/ Dexlansoprazole
  ➡H2-receptor antagonist
- General features
  - Regular use of H2RA will lead to tolerance and loss of therapeutic effects and hence should be used intermittently only
- Indications
  - Mild (LA Grade A - B) esophagitis
  - Non-erosive GERD (NERD)
- Mechanism of action
  - ↓ Gastric acid secretion
- Example: Cimetidine/ Famotidine
  ➡ Antacids
- Neutralization of acid

VIII. **Case study**
Case 1
A 50-year-old man complained of retrosternal chest discomfort in the past 6 months. The discomfort was
compressing in nature with radiation to throat at times. It occurs at any time, with no relation to meals,
sometimes waking him in the middle of night and relieved by drinking water. There was no discomfort walking
upstairs or during exercise. There was also no history of recent trauma, falls, significant loss of weight or
appetite. His past medical history was unremarkable. He was a heavy smoker and a social drinker. His father
had coronary heart disease diagnosed at the age of 55.
Physical examination shows the CVS system was normal. His BP was 140/90 mmHg and he was in sinus
rhythm with HR = 80/min. Examination of chest wall revealed no scarring, deformity or local tenderness. Other
systems were normal.
Q1: What is the likely diagnosis and how common is it?
➡ GERD is the likely diagnosis
➡ More common in developed countries

- Around 10% in Chinese
  ➡ 30 – 40% of the patients have symptoms at least monthly
  Q2: How is GERD diagnosed?
  ➡ 4 Main methods that can be used alone or in combination
  ➡ Symptom questionnaires
- Different versions are available and accuracy is around 80 – 90%
  ➡ Upper endoscopy
  - Detects erosive esophagitis and other macroscopic complications - Accounts for 20 – 40% of symptomatic patients - Presence of lesions supports diagnosis but absence is unhelpful
    ➡ Ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring
  - Inconvenient, uncomfortable and not widely available
  - Seldom used as 1st line diagnostic tool
  - Accuracy is around 80 – 90%
    ➡ Proton pump inhibitor testing
  - Constitutes a therapeutic trial and is conducted over 1 – 4 weeks
  - Patients responding favorably are likely to have a reflux component to their symptoms
    358

Q3: How is GERD treated?
➡Medications

- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
  - Especially for patients with erosive esophagitis which can provide optimal initial healing and long term maintenance therapy
  - **Example:** Omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole)
- H2 antagonist
  - ↓ Gastric acid secretion
  - Symptomatic benefits
- Antacids - Neutralize acid - Symptomatic benefits
  ➡ Surgery
- Open surgery or laparoscopic
- Indications
  - Failure to respond to long-term medical maintenance therapy
  - Presented with severe regurgitation
  - Barrett's esophagus
- Fundoplication - Wrap fundus of stomach around esophagus to create valve effect
  ➡Lifestyle modification
- Dietary modifications
  - Low-fat diet
  - Avoidance of chocolate, spicy food, coffee
  - Avoidance of late meals (eating later than 2-3 hours before bedtime)
- Weight loss
- Elevation of bed head
  - Improve nocturnal symptoms
- Smoking cessation
- Avoid alcohol
- Avoidance of tight belts, corsets

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Achalasia

I. Overview

1. General features
   - Achalasia results from progressive degeneration of ganglion cells in myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus in the esophageal wall leading to failure of relaxation of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) + loss of peristalsis in the distal esophagus
   - Increases risk of developing esophageal cancer

II. Epidemiology

1. General features
   - Males and females are equally affected
   - Occurs at any age but onset before adolescence is rare

III. Pathogenesis

1. Pathogenesis of achalasia
   - Result from inflammation and degeneration of neurons in the esophageal wall
     - Loss of inhibitory neurons in LES causes the basal sphincter pressure to rise and render the sphincter muscle incapable of normal relaxation
     - Loss of inhibitory innervation in smooth muscle portion of esophageal body leading to loss of peristalsis

IV. Etiology

1. Primary causes of achalasia
   - Idiopathic
2. Secondary causes of achalasia - Pseudoachalasia\* - Malignancy at EGJ - Malignancy can cause pseudoachalasia by invading the esophageal neural plexus directly (adenocarcinoma at EGJ) - Paraneoplastic syndrome - Release of uncharacterized humoral factors that disrupts esophageal function as part of paraneoplastic syndrome - Infiltrative disorders - Amyloidosis - Sarcoidosis - Chagas disease - Occurs predominantly in South and Central America - Esophageal infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi
   360

3. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

- Both GERD and achalasia can present with heartburn and regurgitation
- Esophageal manometry is diagnostic of achalasia
  ➡Pseudoachalasia
- Malignancy can cause pseudoachalasia by invading esophageal neural plexus directly or released of humoral factors that disrupt esophageal function as paraneoplastic syndrome
- Same manometric findings with achalasia but can be differentiated by upper endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound
  ➡Other esophageal motility disorders
- Esophageal manometry can differentiate achalasia from other esophageal motility disorder since the lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (integrated relaxation pressure) is normal in these conditions
  - Diffuse esophageal spasm
  - Jackhammer (nutcracker) esophagus

V. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Dysphagia for solid and liquid (~100%)

- Treatment is effective in relieving dysphagia
  ➡Regurgitation (70%)
- Regurgitation of undigested food or saliva immediately after meal
- Aspiration can lead to resultant bronchitis and pneumonia
  ➡Heartburn
- Direct irritation of esophageal lining by food, pills or lactate production by bacterial fermentation of retained carbohydrates
- Abnormal esophageal motor activity might trigger the sensation of heartburn
  ➡Difficulty belching
- Result of a defect in relaxation of upper esophageal sphincter
  ➡ Chest pain
- Retrosternal non-cardiac chest pain
- Related to esophageal spasm
- Treatment is not effective in relieving pain and patient should be counselled about the possible expectations of procedures

361

VI. Diagnosis

1. Biochemical tests
   ➡ Esophageal manometry
   _ Conventional manometry findings
   _ Elevated resting LES pressure
   _ Incomplete relaxation of LES
   _ Aperistalsis in distal 2/3 of esophagus
   _ High-resolution manometry findings
   _ Elevated integrated relaxation pressure (IRP)
   _ Indicates impaired EGJ relaxation
   _ IRP is the median of the maximal relaxation pressures of EGJ in 4s during the 10s-window of EGJ relaxation following a swallow
   _ Upper limit of IRP usually identified as ≥ 15 mmHg
   _ Absence of normal peristalsis
2. Radiological tests
   ➡ CXR
   _ Widening of mediastinum due to dilated esophagus
   _ **ABSENCE** of normal gastric bubble due to failure of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation that prevents air from entering the stomach
   ➡ Oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD)
   _ Exclude benign strictures and malignancy at EJG that can mimic achalasia (i.e. pseudoachalasia)
   _ Up to 40% of patients with achalasia have a normal OGD
   _ Typical findings
   _ Dilated esophagus containing residual material
   _ LES does not open spontaneously to allow effortless passage of endoscope but can be traversed with gentle pressure
   ➡ Barium swallow
   _ Assess esophageal emptying and EGJ morphology
   _ Typical findings
   _ Aperistalsis
   _ Delayed emptying
   _ Dilatation of esophagus with narrowing of distal esophagus
   _ Narrow EGJ with "bird-beak"/ "rat-tail" appearance by contracted LES
   ➡ Endoscopic USG
   _ Useful in characterizing tumours of distal esophagus and gastric cardia
   _ Typical findings
   _ Thickened circular muscle layer at LES and through smooth muscle esophagus
   362

## VII. Treatment

1. General principles
   ➡ Treatment is aimed at decreasing the resting pressure in the LES to a level which sphincter no
   longer impedes the passage of ingested material

- **Pharmacological reduction** in LES pressure (Botulinum toxin injection/ Oral nitrates/
  CCB)
- **Mechanical disruption** of LES muscle fibers (Pneumatic dilatation (PD)/ Surgical
  myotomy/ Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM))
  ➡ **NO** treatment can reverse degeneration of ganglion cells, restore the lost esophageal neurons or
  normalize esophageal functions
- Available treatments do not normalize swallowing but merely improves it

2. Medical treatment
   ➡ Botulinum toxin injection

- Considered in patients who are not good candidates for more definitive therapy with
  pneumatic dilation or surgical myotomy
- Injection of botulinum toxin into LES poisons the excitatory (Ach-releasing) neurons that
  increase LES smooth muscle tone
- Net effect is a decrease in basal LES pressure which allows emptying of esophagus when
  esophageal pressures exceed that of the partially paralyzed LES
  ➡ Nitrates/ CCB
- Least effective treatment option in patients with achalasia which relaxes the smooth
  muscles of LES (decreases the tone of LES)
- Considered in patients who are unwilling or unable to tolerate invasive therapy for
  achalasia or failed botulinum toxin injections
- Preparations include sublingual nifedipine or sublingual isosorbide dinitrate/ nitroglycerin
  administered before meals
  363

3. Surgical treatment
   [Image Description: A series of endoscopic images showing the POEMS procedure for achalasia. The first row of images shows the esophagus during the procedure, with an instrument being inserted and advanced. The second row shows the endoscope view. The images show progression of the dilation procedure, step by step, with numbered labels ① through ⑤ on the images in the first row. The text "Fukuoka univ." appears in the last image of the second row. The title "POEMS" appears beneath both rows of images.]

➡Pneumatic dilatation (PD)

- **MOST** cost-effective treatment and is less invasive
- Forceful dilation with pneumatic balloon of LES weakens LES by circumferential stretching and tearing of its muscle fibers
- Complications
  - Esophageal perforation (2%)
  - GERD
    ➡Surgical myotomy + Fundoplication
- Surgical myotomy weakens LES by cutting its muscle fibers
  - Modified Heller esophagomyotomy
- LES disruption often causes reflux esophagitis and late stricture and therefore is frequently combined with antireflux procedures such as fundoplication
- Complications
  - Esophageal perforation
  - GERD
  - Vagal injury
  - Pneumothorax
    ➡Pre-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM)
- Promising new endoscopic technique to perform myotomy
- A form of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) with endoscopic method for performing myotomy of LES
- Endoscopist makes an incision in esophageal mucosa and endoscope is passed through incision into submucosa creating a submucosal tunnel that is extended distally into the gastric cardia
- Diathermal scalpel is then passed through the endoscope to divide the circular muscle layer of muscularis propria in distal esophagus, LES and proximal stomach
- Closure of the mucosa with metal clips otherwise the saliva will go down through the submucosal tunnel
- **NO** antireflux procedure and therefore is associated with a higher risk of GERD
- Complications (4Ps)
  - Pneumoperitoneum
  - Pneumomediastinum
  - Pneumothorax
  - Perforation

   - Develops as a consequence of chronic GERD
   - Predisposes to development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   - **Male** predominance (M : F = 2:1)
   - Mean age of diagnosis = 55 years old
   - Discovered during endoscopic examination of middle-aged and older adults

# IV. Pathophysiology

## 1. Anatomy of esophagus

Length in cm

[Diagram of the esophagus showing its position from the mouth to the stomach. The esophagus is shown as a long, reddish-pink tube extending from the mouth down through the chest cavity to the stomach. The tube passes various anatomical landmarks along its length. Horizontal dashed lines mark the distance in centimeters from the upper central incisors. Key structures are labeled and positioned along the esophagus to show their relative locations. The mouth is at the top, followed by the upper esophageal sphincter. The thoracic inlet and sternal notch are indicated around the 15 cm mark. The Azygos vein is near the 25 cm mark. The inferior pulmonary vein and diaphragm are around the 35 cm mark. The esophagogastric junction (EGJ) is at approximately 40 cm. The cardia of the stomach is labeled at the lower end of the esophagus.]

➡ Characteristics of esophagus

- Esophagus is a muscular tube that is 25 cm in length
- Begins at cricoid cartilage (at level C6) to stomach (at level T10)
- Upper esophageal sphincter (UES) is formed by cricopharyngeus muscle
- Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is **NOT** an anatomical sphincter but physiological
  - Depends on diaphragmatic constriction

➡ Histological features of esophagus

- Outer longitudinal and inner circular layer
- Lined by non-keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium

➡ Enteric nervous system of esophagus

- Meissner's plexus
  - Located in the submucosa
  - Control secretory activity
- Auerbach's plexus (Myenteric plexus)
  - Located in the muscularis propria
  - Control muscle contraction and motility of GIT

Image B: This image illustrates an esophagus affected by Barrett's esophagus. The columnar epithelium appears salmon-pink with a velvety texture. A white arrow points to the squamocolumnar junction, which is proximal to the GEJ/EGJ, indicating the presence of columnar epithelium in the distal esophagus.

Image C: This image is an endoscopic close-up of a Barrett's esophagus, showing the velvety texture and reddish color characteristic of columnar epithelium.]

**Normal**
Normal stratified squamous
epithelium = Pale-pink and glossy

GEJ/EGJ and squamocolumnar
junction coincides

**Barrett's esophagus**
Columnar epithelium = Salmon-pink and velvety texture

Squamocolumnar junction is proximal to the GEJ/EGJ indicating presence
of columnar epithelium in the distal esophagus

➡ 2 criteria must be fulfilled by endoscopic examination to diagnose Barrett's esophagus

- Endoscopist must document that columnar epithelium lines the distal esophagus
- Histological examination of biopsy specimen from that columnar epithelium must reveal specialized intestinal metaplasia (characterized by Goblet cells)

➡ Differences in gastroesophageal junction (GEJ/ EGJ) and squamocolumnar junction

- Gastroesophageal (GEJ)/ Esophagogastric junction (EGJ)
  - Imaginary line at which the esophagus ends and stomach begins anatomically
  - Defined endoscopically at the level of the most proximal extent of gastric fold
- Squamocolumnar junction
  - Squamous epithelium has a pale glossy appearance
  - Columnar epithelium has a reddish color and velvet-like texture
  - Juxtaposition of these epithelia is known as squamocolumnar junction which forms a visible line known as Z-line

➡ Documentation of criteria

- Normally GEJ/EGJ and squamocolumnar junction coincides = Entire esophagus is lined by stratified squamous epithelium
- When the squamocolumnar junction is located proximal to the GEJ/EGJ = Distal esophagus is lined by columnar epithelium
  - If biopsy specimen from that specific segment shows specialized intestinal metaplasia then confirms the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus
  - Long-segment Barrett's esophagus: Distance between GEJ/EGJ and Z-line ≥ 3 cm
  - Short-segment Barrett's esophagus: Distance between GEJ/EGJ and Z-line < 3 cm

VII. Management

1. Treatment of Barrett's esophagus
   ➡Treatment approaches depends on result of biopsy specimen

- Endoscopic 4-quadrant biopsy should be performed and obtained at 1-cm interval and any
  mucosal irregularities in the segment should be removed with endoscopic resection with
  pathological evaluation
- **ALL** patients with Barrett's esophagus should receive PPI whether they are symptomatic
  or not
  ➡ Non-dysplasia
- Discussion with patient about potential benefits and risks of endoscopic surveillance
- Endoscopic surveillance of every 3 – 5 years is suggested whenever necessary
  ➡ Low-grade dysplasia
- Endoscopic surveillance every 6 months for one year and then annually if -ve (OR)
- Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) followed by endoscopic radiofrequency ablation
  (RFA) to ablate the remaining metaplastic epithelium
  ➡ High-grade dysplasia
- Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) followed by endoscopic radiofrequency ablation
  (RFA) to ablate the remaining metaplastic epithelium
- Esophagectomy - Only therapy that removes all neoplastic epithelium along with any occult
  malignancy and regional LNs - Associated with high procedure-related morbidity and mortality

VIII. Complication

1. Complications of Barrett's esophagus
   ➡Esophageal stricture
   ➡Esophageal ulceration
   ➡Esophageal hemorrhage
   ➡Adenocarcinoma of esophagus (CA esophagus)

- Risk of developing cancer is 30 – 100x compare with normal population

IX. Prevention

1. Surveillance
   ➡ Goal of surveillance is to improve outcomes by detecting dysplasia or esophageal CA early
   enough to provide effective treatment
   ➡ Methods of surveillance

- Chromoendoscopy
- High-resolution white light endoscopy
- Narrow band imaging (NBI)

# Gastrointestinal Disease

## Esophageal cancer

I. Overview

1.  General features
    ➡ Majority of esophageal cancers are squamous cell carcinoma (**more common**) or adenocarcinoma
    _ SCC affects upper 2/3 of esophagus and is multicentric
    _ Adenocarcinoma affects lower 1/3 of esophagus (: GERD) and is not multicentric
    _ Typically exhibits extensive proximal and distal submucosal invasion
    ➡ Modes of spread
    _ Direct spread (e.g. trachea leading to tracheoesophageal fistula)
    _ Lymphatic spread
    _ Hematogenous spread
    ➡ Metastasis to organs including
    _ Lungs
    _ Liver
    _ Bones
    _ Adrenals

II. Epidemiology

1.  General features
    ➡ 6th most common cancer in the world
    ➡ Male preponderance
    ➡ Disease of mid - late childhood
    ➡ Squamous cell carcinoma is common in Asians including HK
    ➡ Adenocarcinoma is common in Caucasians

III. Etiology

1. Risk factors of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
   ➡ Smoking
   ➡Alcoholism
   ➡ Dietary factors
   • Restricted diet of salted fish and pickled vegetables
   • Vegetables and citrus fruit deficiency
   • Trace elements deficiency (e.g. Selenium)
   • Fungal contaminants (e.g. Aflatoxin)
   ➡ Underlying esophageal disease
   • Achalasia
   • Caustic (ingestion) strictures
   ➡ History of H&N cancer
   • Tumour of the aerodigestive tract has a high risk of synchronous (within 6 months) and metachronous tumour due to exposure to same risk factors
   • Prior radiation due to H&N tumour
2. Risk factors of adenocarcinoma
   ➡ Smoking
   ➡ Obesity
   ➡Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
   • Esophageal adenocarcinoma mostly arises from a region of Barrett's metaplasia which is due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
   ➡Barrett's esophagus
   • Metaplastic columnar epithelium that replaces stratified squamous epithelium that normally lines the distal esophagus

IV. _Pathophysiology_

1. Anatomy of esophagus

[Diagram of the esophagus with key structures and measurements. At the top, the open mouth with teeth labeled "Upper central incisors" is visible. Below it, a long, pink tube represents the esophagus, labeled with measurements in centimeters from 0 to 42. At 15 cm, a label points to "Upper esophageal sphincter." At 17 cm, "Thoracic inlet" and "Sternal notch" are indicated. Around 23cm is "Azygos v." Around 28cm "Inferior Pulmonary v.". On the right side of the esophagus, labels indicate regions: "Cervical esophagus" is near the top, followed by "Upper thoracic esophagus", "Middle thoracic esophagus", and "Lower thoracic esophagus / Esophagogastric junction (EGJ)" near the bottom where the esophagus connects to the stomach. The diaphragm crosses the esophagus at approximately 35 cm. The final part of the esophagus enters into the stomach at 42 cm, labeled as "Cardia". There is a yellow line marking the EGJ.]

➡Characteristics of esophagus

- Esophagus is a muscular tube that is 25 cm in length
- Begins at cricoid cartilage (at level C6) to stomach (at level T10)
- Upper esophageal sphincter (UES) is formed by cricopharyngeus muscle
- Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is **NOT** an anatomical sphincter but physiological - Depends on diaphragmatic constriction
  ➡Histological features of esophagus
- Outer longitudinal and inner circular layer
- Lined by non-keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium
  ➡Enteric nervous system of esophagus
- Meissner's plexus
  - Located in the submucosa
    - Control secretory activity
- Auerbach's plexus (Myenteric plexus)
  - Located in the muscularis propria
    - Control muscle contraction and motility of GIT

3. Classification of EGJ and cardia cancers
   [An illustration showing three types of EGJ and cardia cancers, labeled as Type I, Type II, and Type III. Each type visually demonstrates the location and extent of the tumor in relation to the stomach and esophagus. Type I shows the tumor primarily in the lower esophagus near the EGJ. Type II shows the tumor localized at the EGJ. Type III shows the tumor mainly in the upper part of the stomach close to the EGJ. The illustration labels the Squamocolumnar Junction (SCJ) and Esophagogastric Junction (EGJ) and highlights the affected regions.]

➡ AJCC/UICC TNM staging (8th edition, 2017)

- Tumors involving the EGJ with the tumor epicenter no more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as **esophageal cancer**
- EGJ tumors with their epicenter located more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as **stomach cancer**
  - As with all cardia cancers not involving the EGJ, even if they involve the EGJ are also staged as stomach cancer

➡Siewert classification

- **Type I** = Located between 5 and 1 cm proximal to anatomical Z-line
  - Adenocarcinoma of distal esophagus usually arise from area with specialized intestinal metaplasia of esophagus (Barrett's esophagus) and may infiltrate the EGJ from above
  - **Treatment** = Transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy + Partial gastrectomy + 2-field lymphadenectomy
- **Type II** = Located between 1 cm proximal and 2 cm distal to the anatomical Z-line
  - True carcinoma of cardia arising from the cardiac epithelium or short segments with intestinal metaplasia at the EGJ
  - **Treatment** = Transabdominal/ Transhiatal resection of the distal esophagus + Total gastrectomy + Lymphadenectomy of the lower mediastinum and the abdominal D2 nodal compartment
- **Type III** = Located between 2 and 5 cm distal to anatomical Z-line
  - Subcardial gastric carcinoma that infiltrates the EGJ and distal esophagus from below
  - **Treatment** = Transabdominal/ Transhiatal resection of the distal esophagus + Total gastrectomy + Lymphadenectomy of the lower mediastinum and the abdominal D2 nodal compartment

375

VI. Clinical manifestations

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Dysphagia\*

- First and most common manifestation
- Tolerate fluid and soft food better
  ➡Odynophagia\*
- Develops late in disease course usually due to extra-esophageal involvement
  ➡Regurgitation (reflux)\*
- Secondary to tumour disrupting normal peristalsis
- Risk of aspiration pneumonia
  ➡Hematemesis or melena
- Rare manifestation and usually occurs in late course of disease
- Bleeding from primary tumour or erosion into aorta or pulmonary vessels
  ➡Anemic symptoms
- Pallor
- Palpitations
- Dyspnea
- Fatigue
  ➡Constitutional symptoms
- Nausea and vomiting
- Anorexia and weight loss
- Lymphadenopathy
  - Enlarged supraclavicular LN indicates disseminated disease

2. Signs and symptoms of locally advanced malignancy
   ➡Hoarseness

- Left recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy due to tumour invasion
  ➡Choking/Cough / Fever
- Formation of tracheoesophageal fistula leading to aspiration pneumonia
  ➡Horner's syndrome

3. Signs and symptoms of distant metastasis
   ➡Cough/ Dyspnea/ Hematemesis

- Indicates lung metastasis
  ➡Jaundice/ RUQ pain/ Ascites
- Indicates liver metastasis
  ➡Chronic spinal pain
- Indicates bone metastasis
  376

VII. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Pallor
  - Result of chronic blood loss or malnutrition (iron-deficiency)
- Jaundice
  - Indicates liver metastasis
- Hydration and nutritional status
  - Dehydration and cachexia
- Lymphadenopathy
  - Left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow's node) since the lymphatic drainage is through the thoracic duct
    ➡Abdominal examination
- Abdominal scars
  - Previous abdominal surgery will affect choice of surgery
- Hepatomegaly
  - Indicates liver metastasis
- Ascites
  - Indicates liver metastasis
- PR examination
  - Look for rectal deposits
    ➡Neurological examination
- Evaluation of neuromuscular causes of dysphagia

2. Staging investigations
   ➡Staging information can be gathered before commencement of therapy, during therapy or following treatment
   ➡Only indicated for patients suitable for potentially curative therapies

- OGD with biopsy
- Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) + laparoscopy
- CT/MRI/PET-scan

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials
   ➡Clotting profile

- Pre-operative assessment before OGD
  ➡ Electrolyte profile
- Assess for electrolyte abnormalities due to vomiting
  ⇨ LFT
- Albumin and pre-albumin to evaluate for nutritional status
- Evaluate for possible liver metastasis
  ⇨ RFT
- Assess pre-renal causes of dehydration
  ➡ Lung function test
- Assess for pulmonary function before surgery

377

4. Radiological tests
   ⇨CXR

- Mechanical and functional dysphagia can lead to aspiration pneumonia
- Evaluate for possible lung metastasis and presence of pleural effusions
- Look for soft-tissue mass that leads to extra-mural cause of dysphagia including bronchogenic carcinoma
  ➡Barium swallow
- Assess for tumour complication such as tracheoesophageal fistula
- Demonstrate proximal dilatation, mucosal irregularity and annular constriction
  ➡OGD with biopsy or brush cytology
- Biopsy should be taken for all lesions in esophagus irrespective of how trivial they appear and the indication for the examination
- Chromoendoscopy with Lugol's iodine
  - Lugol's iodine has an affinity for glycogen in squamous epithelium
  - Normal squamous epithelium with glycogen will mix with iodine and stained black, dark-brown or green brown
  - Absence of dye uptake in conditions that result in depletion of glycogen in squamous cells such as inflammatory change in reflux esophagitis, dysplasia or early malignancy
  - Commonly used in esophagus for detection of squamous dysplasia and early SCC
  - Guide endoscopic mucosal resection of early SCC since it can help in revealing the extent and delineation of a lesion
- Narrow-band imaging (NBI)
  - High-resolution endoscopic technique that enhances fine structures of mucosal surface without the use of dyes
- Advantages (+ve)
  - Direct view of esophageal mucosa and lesion
  - Combination of histology and cytology from biopsy has high diagnostic accuracy
- Disadvantages (-ve)
  - Only the mucosal surface can be studied and biopsied
    ➡Bronchoscopy
- NOT routinely performed because CXR is more sensitive to detect synchronous or metastatic tumour in the lung
- Indicated in patients with suspected tracheoesophageal fistula who presents with choking
- Indicated in patients with tumour located in the upper and middle 1/3 of esophagus since it is in close proximity to trachea and its bifurcation
  - Tumour located in the distal-1/3 esophagus is unlikely to invade into bronchus
    ➡ Endoscopic USG
- Assess locoregional staging (T/N)
  - Tla MUST be distinguished from T1b cancer since the chance of lymph node metastasis in T1b cancer is so high that open surgery is required
  - Superior to CT scan in loco-regional staging of tumour
- Depth of tumour penetration through esophageal wall
  - Spread through esophageal wall (T1 – 3)
  - Invasion of adjacent organs (T4)
- Regional lymph node spread
  - Metastasis to lymph node (NO or N1)
  - USG-guided FNAC of lymph node can also be performed

378

➡ CT scan thorax + abdomen

- Assess locoregional staging (T/ N) especially to distinguish T4 lesion
  - T4 lesion invades to adjacent structure
    - Resectable structures = Pleura/ Pericardium/ Diaphragm
    - Unresectable structures = Aorta/ Trachea/ Bronchus/ Spine
- Assess distant metastasis staging (M)
  - Modality of choice to assess M stage
- Modality used to identify regional or distant metastasis
  ➡ PET-CT scan
- Assess distant metastasis staging (M)
- Combined with CT to anatomically locate tumours
- Relies on high metabolic activity of tumours compared with normal tissues - Radiopharmaceutical agents enter highly metabolic active cells and is phosphorylated - Phosphorylated product is highly polar molecule and cannot easily diffuse out of cells
  ➡ Laparoscopy
- Assess distant metastasis staging (M)
- Useful for diagnosis of occult hepatic and peritoneal metastasis
- Only modality reliably able to detect peritoneal tumour seedlings
  ➡ Preoperative workup
- ECG/ Echocardiography to assess for cardiopulmonary reserve
- Lung function test (FEV 1.0) to assess for cardiopulmonary reserve - Patients with FEV 1.0 < 1.25 L is a poor candidate for thoracotomy because there is a 40% risk of death from respiratory failure within 4 years - Transhiatal (THE) esophagectomy should be considered in patients with poor pulmonary reserve since the pulmonary morbidity is less than thoracotomy
  ➡ X MRI scan
- MRI has intrinsic motion artifact when the patient is breathing and swallowing during the procedure

379

# VIII. Treatment

1. General principles
   ➡ Curative VS Palliative

- Early stage cancer should be offered curative treatment
  - Curative treatment includes surgery and radical radiotherapy
- Advanced stage cancer should be offered palliative care
  ➡ Choice of treatment should always depend on 3 factors - Tumour factor - Size of tumour - Location of tumour (define upper, middle and lower 1/3 of cancer, cardia) - Location of anastomosis (cervical/ intrathoracic) - Presence of lymph node metastasis - Presence of invasion into adjacent major organs (resectable/ unresectable) - Patient factor - Fitness of patient - Surgeon factor - Experience of surgeon - Hospital equipment
  ➡ Treatment objectives - Local control = Resection of tumour with negative (clear) resection margin - Regional control = Lymph node dissection - Systemic control = NOT indicated for CA esophagus

[Image Description: The image is a digital rendering of a handwritten or typed medical document. The page is clean and white, with black, consistently sized text aligned to the left. The content is an itemized list related to cancer treatment. It includes headings like "Treatment," "General principles," and "Treatment objectives," along with sub-points about curative vs. palliative care, tumor factors, patient factors, surgeon factors, and local, regional, and systemic control of the disease. The formatting includes bullet points and indentation to indicate a clear hierarchy of information. At the bottom right corner of the image, there is a number "380," likely representing a page number.]

2. Medical treatment
   ➡ Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy

- Surgery alone produces few cures in either squamous cell or adenocarcinoma except in earliest stages of diseases
- Alternative approach especially for patients unfit for esophagectomy
  - Radical radiotherapy is **ALSO** curative
- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  - Downstage and shrink the tumour to increase chance of operability
  - Eradicate occult or silent micrometastasis next to primary tumour
    - Based on the observation that most patients develop postoperative systemic metastasis without local recurrences
- Adjuvant chemoradiation
  - Eradicate residual tumour at resection margin
  - Decreases risk of local recurrence

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Endoscopic therapy

- General features
  - **Pros:** Esophageal preservation and reduced post-treatment mortality
  - **Cons:** Technically demanding and lack of long-term outcomes and recurrence data
- Indications
  - Superficial cancer that are limited to mucosa (T1a) but **NOT** for more advanced cancer since the chance of lymph node metastasis is too high
    - Tumour invasion into submucosa (T1b) (_even without visible LN involvement_) should receive esophagectomy with LN dissection due to high frequency (20 – 25%) of concurrent findings of positive LNs
  - Patients who preferred esophageal preservation
- Technique
  - Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR): Snare resection of dysplastic lesion
    - EMR is not effective for lesions > 2 cm since piecemeal resection is often necessary which increases chance of complications and makes it impossible to be conclusive about the completeness of resection at lateral margin
  - Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD): Dissect lesions from the submucosa - ESD can remove larger lesions intact
    [Image of an arrow pointing right] Esophagectomy with reconstruction and LN dissection
- General features
  - Approaches include transthoracic (TTE) and transhiatal (THE) approach
  - Lymph node dissection is mandatory in all approaches
  - Resection margin should be genuine since CA esophagus is **NOCTORIOUS** for submucosal spread
  - Lesion of the cardia that do not involve esophagus to significant extent can be either be dealt by extended total gastrectomy to include distal esophagus (OR) proximal gastrectomy with distal esophagectomy

- Choice of surgery

| Types               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Transthoracic (TTE) | Ivor-Lewis (2-stage) ➡ **MOST** commonly performed approach ➡ More appropriate for tumour in distal 1/3 of esophagus or intraabdominal region - **NOT** suitable for tumours located in upper and middle 1/3 of esophagus ➡Anastomosis is inside the intrathoracic cavity - Complication like anastomotic leakage can be detrimental since it may lead to mediastinitis or pleuritis |
| McKeown (3-stage)   | ➡More appropriate for more proximal tumour to achieve better longitudinal clearance - Tumours in distal 1/3 of esophagus can also be managed by McKeown approach based on surgeon's preference ➡Anastomosis is inside the cervical region - Complication like anastomotic leakage is easier to be managed by percutaneous drainage                                                   |
| Transhiatal ()      | ➡Unsuitable for most CA esophagus since complete mediastinal lymphadenectomy cannot be achieved ➡Thoracotomy is **NOT** required which is associated with fewer pulmonary complications                                                                                                                                                                                              |

➡Lymph node dissection

- Indicated along with esophagectomy in patients with nodal metastasis
- Different fields of dissection
  - Field 1 = Cervical LN
  - Field 2 = Mediastinal LN
  - Field 3 = Intra-abdominal (celiac) LN
- Standard two-field dissection for majority of tumours
  - Upper 1/3 = Field 1 and 2 dissection; Lower 1/3 = Field 2 and 3 dissection
  - Adenocarcinoma has a relative low incidence in the neck and hence 2-field lymphadenectomy is adequate
- Extended three-field dissection which is a more radical approach
  - SCC a higher proportion of patients have upper and middle 1/3 tumour in thoracic esophagus and hence 3-field lymphadenectomy is understandable

- Post-operative complications

| Types   | Complications              |
| ------- | -------------------------- |
| Medical | ➡Pulmonary complications\* |
|         | - Atelectasis              |

- Pneumonia\*
- Bronchospasm
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- Acute exacerbation of COPD
- Pulmonary embolism
- Respiratory failure
  |
  | | ➡Cardiac complications |
  | | - Atrial fibrillation (AF)\*
- Myocardial infarction |
  | Surgical | ➡Conduit complications |
  | | - Anastomotic leak\* - Patient is usually kept NPO 5 – 7 days following surgery - Jejunostomy feeding tube is placed during surgery and feeding is initiated at day 2 – 3 - Gastrografin swallow can be performed to check for anastomotic leak from day 5 – 7 before initiating oral intake - Cervical anastomotic leak can be managed by opening the incision to allow drainage - Intrathoracic leak is associated with high mortality rate and large or poorly drained leaks require operative exploration
- Anastomotic stricture\*
- Conduit ischemia |
  | | ➡Chylothorax\* |
  | | - Thoracic duct is in close proximity to esophagus
- Diagnosis is based upon an increase in chest tube output and change in nature of output from serosanguinous to a milky appearance with enteral alimentation
- Output is not milky initially due to absence of fat ingestion immediately post-operatively
- Presence of triglycerides > 110 mg/dL or chylomicrons in pleural fluid is generally diagnostic of a chyle leak
- Managed conservatively by elimination of enteral nutrition and change to TPN, close observation of chest tube output, octreotide administration and fluid resuscitation
- Surgical treatment includes a right thoracotomy with retraction of conduit and ligation of thoracic duct |
  | | ➡Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury\*\* |
  | | - Hoarseness
- Increased risk of aspiration pneumonia
  ➡Functional disorders
- GERD
- Dysphagia
- Delayed gastric emptying |

4. Palliative treatment
   ➡Indications

- Patients with metastatic cancer
- Cancers invading adjacent organs that is unresectable (T4b)
  ➡Options of palliative treatment
- Esophageal dilation with stenting
  • Intraluminal prosthesis intubates the esophagus and stent the obstruction with self-
  expanding metallic stents via endoscopic placement
  Ο NOT suitable for tumours long in size due to poor functional peristalsis or located in
  the cervical esophagus due to discomfort
  • Potential complications include perforation, erosion, obstruction of tube or migration
  of the stent
- Endoluminal laser technique
  Restore esophageal lumen successfully 90% of the time with only a 4 – 5%
- Radiotherapy
  Modalities include external beam irradiation or brachytherapy
  SCC is usually radiosensitive whereas adenocarcinoma is less responsive
  First choice for palliation of EGJ cancers since stents placed across the EGJ is
  associated with higher chance of gastroesophageal reflux
- Chemotherapy
  Current treatment modalities include cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
  o perforation rate
- Nutritional support
  Ο
  Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or jejunostomy tube (PEJ)

IX. Prognosis

1. Complications
   ➡Aspiration pneumonia

- Secondary to formation of tracheobronchial fistula
  ➡Massive bleeding from aorta
- Secondary to infiltration of tumour into aorta

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Peptic ulcer disease (PUD)

I. Overview

1. General features

➡ Defects in the gastrointestinal mucosa that extends through the muscularis mucosae

➡ Locations of peptic ulcer

- Duodenum (75%)
  - 1st part of duodenum (D1) (**most common**)
    - Unusual for non-NSAIDs/ steroids ulcers to occur in sites other than D1 and should raise clinical suspicion
    - Ulcers can occur anywhere for NSAIDs/ steroids users
- Stomach (20%)
  - Lesser curvature and gastric antrum

➡ Relationship with gastritis and gastric cancer

- Gastric ulcers
  - Associated with pangastritis involving gastric antrum and body
  - Natural history of H. pylori gastritis involves the inflammation of the antrum which eventually progresses to the adjacent corpus resulting in a reduction in the acid secretion of the stomach, eventual loss of parietal cells and the development of atrophy
  - ○↓ Gastric acid secretion (hypochlorhydria) which predisposes to gastric cancer (by compensatory increase in gastrin production)
- Duodenal ulcers
  - Associated with antral-predominant gastritis that spares the acid-secreting body
  - ↑ Gastric acid secretion which does NOT predisposes to gastric cancer

2. Classification of peptic ulcer

➡ Modified Johnson classification

- Based upon anatomical location and acid-secretory potential
- Provides a useful basis for considering elective surgery in gastric ulcer

| Types                    | Location                                      | Acid hypersecretion |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Type I** (most common) | Along lesser curvature near angular incisure  | X                   |
| **Type II**              | Body of stomach (GU) + Duodenum (DU)          | √                   |
| **Type III**             | Prepyloric                                    | √                   |
| **Type IV**              | High on lesser curvature near OGJ             | X                   |
| **Type V**               | Any location given that is medication-induced | X                   |

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology

➡ Male predominance (M:F = 3:1)

386

III. Pathophysiology

1. Anatomy of stomach

[Image Description: A diagram of the stomach, showing its different parts and blood supply. The stomach is divided into the cardia, fundus, body, antrum, and pylorus. The esophagus leads into the cardia. The fundus is located above the cardia. The body is the main part of the stomach. The antrum is located below the body. The pylorus is the outlet of the stomach.
Arteries supplying the stomach are: short gastric artery, left gastric artery, right gastric artery, left gastro-omental (gastroepiploic) artery, and right gastro-omental (gastroepiploic) artery. Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve supply are labeled.]

➡ **Arterial** supply

- Greater curvature
  - Short gastric artery
  - Left gastro-omental (gastroepiploic) artery
  - Right gastro-omental (gastroepiploic) artery
- Lesser curvature
  - Left gastric artery
  - Right gastric artery

➡ **Nerve** supply

- Sympathetic nerve supply
  - Greater splanchnic nerve (T5 – 9 sympathetic trunk)
- Parasympathetic nerve supply
  - **Anterior** vagal nerve: Stomach + Pylorus + Liver
  - **Posterior** vagal nerve: Stomach + Foregut and midgut down to splenic flexure

387

IV. Etiology

1. Risk factors
   ➡H. pylori infection

- Microaerophilic Gram -ve coccobacilli
- Strong urease activity which is vital for its survival and colonization
  - Bacterial urease hydrolyzes gastric luminal urea to form ammonia that helps
    neutralize gastric acid and form a protective cloud around organisms
- Spiral shaped, flagella and mucolytic enzymes facilitates its passage through mucus layer
  to the gastric surface epithelium
  ➡NSAIDs (including aspirin)
- Pathogenesis
  - Gastric and duodenal mucosa use COX-1 for prostaglandin synthesis
  - Prostaglandins such as PGE2 protect mucosal lining from injury by mucin
    production, mucosal bicarbonate secretion, maintaining mucosal blood flow and
    inhibiting gastric acid secretion
  - NSAIDS which non-selectively inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 impair production of
    prostaglandins (Selectively COX-2 inhibitors can therefore preserve PG-mediated
    gastrointestinal mucosal protection)
  - Disruption of mucosal barrier function which increases mucosal permeability to
    H+ ions which leads to resultant damage to surface cells by gastric acid
- Risk factors for peptic ulcer disease in patients taking NSAIDs - Advanced age of patients (> 75 years) - Prior history of clinical ulcer diseases or ulcer complications - Relatively toxic/ High dose/ Long duration of NSAIDs - Concurrent use of corticosteroids/anticoagulants
  ➡ Stress
- Burns and trauma
- Psychological stress
  ➡ Smoking
  ➡Alcoholism
  ➡Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
- Hypersecretion of gastrin by stomach, duodenal or pancreatic gastrinoma
  - ↑ Gastric acid production and induces gastric epithelial cell proliferation
- Suspected when patients resent with recurrent ulcers despite adequate treatment, ulcers in
  unusual location such as 2nd part of duodenum or jejunum, complicated PUD without
  history of NSAIDs use and H. pylori -ve
- Diagnosed with increased fasting serum gastrin level in the presence of high acid
  secretion

388

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Symptoms
   ➡ Epigastric pain

- Burning, gnawing and intermittent pain
- Classical pain from gastric ulcers
  - Precipitated by food (visceral sensitization and gastroduodenal dysmotility)
- Classical pain from duodenal ulcers
  - Pain awakening from sleep (circadian stimulation of acid secretion is maximal)
  - Occurs 2 – 5 hours after a meal
  - Relieved by food and antacid
    ➡ Associated symptoms
- Early satiety
- Postprandial fullness
- Gastroesophageal reflux
- Fatty food intolerance
- Nausea and vomiting
- Anorexia and weight loss

2. Symptoms related to complications
   ➡ Bleeding

- Postural hypotension
- **Hematemesis:** Vomiting of red blood or coffee-ground like material
- **Melena:** Black, tarry stools
- **Hematochezia:** Fresh red blood in stools in massive bleeding
  ➡ Perforation
- Fever/ Tachycardia/ Hypotension
- Acute onset of severe diffuse abdominal pain
  ➡ Penetration
- Change in pain symptoms
  - More intense pain of longer duration
  - Shift from a typical vague visceral discomfort to a localized intense pain at back
  - NOT relieved by food or antacids
    ➡ Fistulization
- Gastrocolic or duodenocolic fistula
  - Feculent vomiting
  - Postprandial diarrhea
  - Dyspepsia
  - Weight loss
    ➡ Gastric outlet obstruction
- Epigastric pain after eating
- Early satiety
- Indigestion
- Bloating sensation
- Nausea and vomiting
- Anorexia and weight loss

389

VI. **Diagnosis**

1. Physical examination
   ➡ General examination

- Fever
- Tachycardia
- Postural hypotension
  ➡ Abdominal examination
- Epigastric tenderness
- Peritoneal signs
  - Indicates perforation and peritonitis
- Succussion splash
  - Indicates retained fluid in stomach suggesting gastric outlet obstruction

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials

- Microcytic hypochromic anemia - Iron deficiency anemia due to blood loss
  ➡ Tests for H. pylori infection
- **ALL** patients diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease by endoscopy should undergo testing for H. pylori infection
- Biopsy should be taken at the antrum since it has the highest density of H. pylori infection as H. pylori tries to avoid the acid-secreting parietal cells at the fundus and body
  - Migration of H. pylori from the gastric antrum to the proximal stomach following acid suppression or antibiotics eradication therapy has been reported
    - Additional biopsy from the gastric body should be taken to increase sensitivity of testing
- Invasive tests (3 bites of biopsy from OGD required)
  - Rapid urease test (CLO test) (require 1 bite of biopsy)
    - Gastric biopsy specimen is placed in a medium that contains urea and a pH reagent
    - Urease cleaves urea to liberate **NH3** producing an alkaline pH and a resultant color change from yellow to pink
  - Histological examination (require 2 bites of biopsy)
    - Diagnosis H. pylori infection and associated lesions such as atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia
  - Bacterial culture with antibiotic sensitivity test
    - Only indicated in treatment refractory cases
- Non-invasive tests
  - Urea breath test
    - Urea with a labelled with carbon isotopic non-radioactive 13C (more expensive) or radioactive 14C (less expensive) which is not preferred in pregnant woman and young children
    - Urea is hydrolysed by H. pylori (urease-producing bacteria) to liberate ammonia and **CO2**
    - H. pylori then liberate labelled CO2 that can be detected in breath samples
  - Stool antigen detection test
  - Urine antibody detection test

390

3. Radiological tests
   ➡ CXR (erect)

- Look for free gas under diaphragm in PPU
  ➡ Oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD) (Upper endoscopy) + Biopsy
- Both diagnostic and therapeutic
- Biopsy is required to rule out malignancy
- Morphological appearance of benign and malignancy ulcers

| Types         | Appearance                                                                                                                                 |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Benign**    | ➡ Smooth, regular and rounded edges ➡ Flat, smooth ulcer base often filled with exudate                                                    |
| **Malignant** | ➡ Ulcerated mass protruding into lumen ➡ Irregular or thickened ulcer margins ➡ Folds surrounding ulcer crater are nodular, clubbed, fused |

- Appearance of ulcer can be described using Forrest classification
  - Endoscopic findings known as stigmata of recent hemorrhage (SRH) allow prognostication of the rebleeding risk
  - **High** risk (Class I and II): Endoscopic therapy required
  - **Low** risk (Class III): Acid suppression alone is adequate

| Class | Stigmata of recent hemorrhage | Prevalence | Chance of rebleeding |
| :---- | :---------------------------- | :--------- | :------------------- |
| Ia    | Spurting hemorrhage           | 10%        | 55 – 100%            |
| Ib    | Oozing hemorrhage             | 10%        |                      |
| Па    | Non-bleeding visible vessels  | 25%        | 40 – 50%             |
| IIb   | Adherent clot                 | 10%        | 20 – 30%             |
| IIc   | Flat pigmented spot           | 10%        | 10%                  |
| III   | Clean base                    | 35%        | 5%                   |

- Post-endoscopic monitoring of Hb count is required to identify rebleeding
- Follow-up endoscopy
  - Gastric ulcer: Necessary till complete healing is confirmed
    - Avoid missing concomitant gastric cancer due to sampling error
    - Healing of ulcers reassures that the lesion is likely to be benign
  - Uncomplicated duodenal ulcer: Unnecessary if asymptomatic
    - Majority of duodenal ulcers are benign
  - Complicated duodenal ulcer: Necessary till complete healing is confirmed
    ➡ Barium meal and small bowel follow-through
  - NOT routinely done nowadays due to widespread availability of OGD, desire to limit radiation exposure and inherent limitations such as inability to biopsy

391

VII. **Treatment**

1. General approach
   ➡ Indications for surgery

- Complicated peptic ulcer disease
- Refractory to medical treatment - Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma) should be exclude before performing
  elective surgery for PUD
- Suspicious of malignancy - Failure of gastric ulcer to heal after 12 weeks of medical therapy indicates need
  for elective surgery even if biopsy is benign

2. Supportive treatment
   ➡ Alteration in medications

- NSAIDS users
  - Switch to less ulcerogenic NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors
  - Withdraw NSAIDs during PPI treatment
- Aspirin users - **Bleeding peptic ulcer:** Resume aspirin with PPI treatment once hemostasis is
  secured to minimize cardiovascular risk - **Non-bleeding peptic ulcer:** Continue aspirin with PPI treatment
  ➡ Lifestyle modification
- Smoking cessation
- Limit alcohol intake

4. Surgical treatment

[Image of Pyloroplasty. Pyloroplasty is shown in two figures, labeled a and b. Both figures depict the lower part of the stomach where it connects to the small intestine. In figure a, the stomach is cut open vertically. In figure b, the stomach is sutured horizontally, widening the passage.]

[Image of Gastrojejunostomy. This is a procedure that creates a new connection between the stomach and the jejunum (part of the small intestine), bypassing the duodenum.]

Pyloroplasty
Gastrojejunostomy
➡Truncal vagotomy + Pyloroplasty (OR) Gastrojejunostomy

- Vagotomy is a procedure that divides main trunks of anterior and posterior vagus nerve to decrease gastric acid secretion
  - Vagal stimulation for gastrin release is abolished and parietal cells becomes less responsive to gastrin and histamine to produce gastric acid
  - Nerve of Latarjet is transected and hence the stomach fails to empty adequately and thus gastric drainage procedure is required
  - Gastric drainage via pyloroplasty or gastrojejunostomy facilitates gastric emptying and thus avoid gastric stasis
- Pyloroplasty
  - Procedures that widens the opening between antrum and duodenum to facilitate passage of gastric contents
  - Preferred over gastrojejunostomy because the normal anatomic relationship between stomach and duodenum is preserved
- Gastrojejunostomy
  - Anastomosis the dependent portion of stomach to the proximal jejunum
  - Reserved for patients with significant duodenal bulb scarring that precludes safe pyloroplasty

394

[Diagram of a healthy stomach labeled "Normal" with its key parts visible. Beside it are three diagrams depicting different surgical procedures: "Billroth I reconstruction", "Billroth II reconstruction", and "Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy". These diagrams illustrate how the stomach is altered during each procedure.]

➡Gastrectomy with reconstruction

- Gastrectomy options includes antrectomy or subtotal gastrectomy
- Billroth I reconstruction
  - Difficult to accomplish due to severe inflammation around pylorus and duodenum
    and is generally not recommended
- Billroth II reconstruction
  - Preferred approach for reconstruction
  - Brings up a loop of proximal jejunum to create an end-to-side gastrojejunostomy
- Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy - Advantage: Roux limb divert biliary and pancreatic secretion away from stomach - Disadvantage: Exacerbate problems with gastric emptying in patients with gastric
  outlet obstruction
  ➡Highly selective vagotomy
- Eliminates vagal stimulation to only the acid-secreting portion of stomach without
  interrupting motor innervation to antrum and pylorus - Division of gastric branches only sparing anterior and posterior nerve of Latarjet
- Preserve gastric emptying postoperatively and AVOID gastric drainage by either
  pyloroplasty or gastrojejunostomy
- Associated with higher recurrence rate

VIII. Complications (and management)

1. Bleeding (Hemorrhage)
   ➡General features

- Duodenal ulcer bleeding usually locates at the posterior duodenal wall within 2 cm of pylorus and typically erodes into gastroduodenal artery (GDA)
- Signs of recurrence of bleeding = Hematemesis/Fresh melena/ Tachycardia/ Falling Hb trend (anemia)/ Blood in the NG tube
  ➡Indications for surgery
- Failed endoscopic therapy
- Recurrent hemorrhage
- Hemodynamic instability despite vigorous fluid resuscitation
- Continuous slow bleeding with transfusion > 3 units per day
  ➡Medical treatment
- Fluid resuscitation
- Blood transfusion
- IV PPI
  - Promotes rapid ulcer healing and reduces rebleeding rates
  - Example: Pantoprazole
    ➡ Endoscopic treatment
- BEST initial diagnostic and therapeutic procedure
- Indicated in patients with Spurting (Class Ia)/ Oozing from ulcer (Ib)/ Visible vessel (Class IIa)/ Adherent blood clot (Class IIb)
- Standard approach includes thermal coagulation and hemoclip placement
- Combined therapy includes injection therapy + either thermal coagulation or hemoclip placement which is preferred
  - Injection therapy should not be used as monotherapy since it is associated with high rate of recurrent bleeding compared to other modalities
- Treatment modalities
  - Chemical: Injection with epinephrine for local tamponade effect and vasoconstriction
  - Thermal: Coaptive coagulation of underlying artery in ulcer base with heat probe
  - Mechanical: Hemoclips placement
    ➡Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE)
- Perform angiography of celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery
  - Evaluate for any contrast extravasation
  - Selective cannulation of bleeding vessels followed by angiographic coiling from a distal to proximal manner until extravasation ceased
- Equally effective when compared with surgery in patients who failed therapeutic endoscopy and associates with fewer complications
- Reduce the need of surgery without increasing overall mortality and should be considered in patients who are high risk for surgery
  ➡Surgical treatment
- Gastric ulcers (GU)
  - Partial gastrectomy with Billroth I/II reconstruction
- Duodenal ulcers (DU)
  - Duodenotomy with pyloroplasty incision
  - 3-point ligation of gastroduodenal artery at the superior and inferior aspect of the ulcer and transverse pancreatic artery
  - Truncal vagotomy can be performed to decrease acid secretion
  - Closure with pyloroplasty for gastric drainage

396

2. Perforation
   ➡General features

- Duodenal perforation usually occurs at anterior wall of 1st part of duodenum
  ➡Medical treatment
- NPO
- Nasogastric (NG) tube with Q1H aspiration
- Foley catheter with Q1H monitoring
- Fluid resuscitation
- IV PPI
  - Enhance fibrin formation and promote rapid sealing of perforation
  - Promote cessation of bleeding
  - Example: Pantoprazole
- IV Broad-spectrum antibiotics - Cover enteric Gram -ve rods, anaerobes and mouth flora - Combination of 3rd generation cephalosporin and metronidazole
  ➡Surgical treatment
- Gastric ulcer (GU) - Omental (Graham) patch repair (Omentopexy) (associate with postoperative
  gastric outlet obstruction) + Biopsy (rule out gastric malignancy) - Partial gastrectomy with Billroth I/II reconstruction (preferred since the ulcer at
  risk of gastric malignancy is removed)
- Duodenal ulcer (DU) - Omental (Graham) patch repair (Omentopexy) - **CANNOT** simply place suture since the perforation site only signifies the
  central part of ulcer but the surrounding rim is also part of the ulcer base
  and is usually thinner - Omental patch is used instead to prevent the sutures from cutting through
  the ulcer base since the rim of ulcer is thinner than usual - Truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty incorporating the perforation
  [Image of a surgical treatment diagram of gastric and duodenal ulcers]

397

3. Gastric outlet obstruction
   ➡General features

- Inflammation from PUD cause edema and duodenal spasm
- Fibrosis and scarring due to chronic peptic ulcer disease
- Gastric atony developed after prolonged obstruction
  ➡Medical treatment
- NPO
- Nasogastric (NG) tube
- Fluid resuscitation
- Correction of electrolyte abnormality - Normal saline and KCl is administered when indicated - Prolonged vomiting leading to hyponatremia, hypokalemic, hypochloremic
  metabolic alkalosis
- IV PPI - Anti-secretory agents are still the mainstay of initial treatment - **Example:** Pantoprazole
  ➡Endoscopic treatment
- Endoscopic balloon dilatation
  ➡Surgical treatment
- Gastric ulcer (GU)
  - Antrectomy with Billroth I/II reconstruction
- Duodenal ulcer (DU)
  - Truncal vagotomy + Antrectomy with Billroth I/II reconstruction

4. Penetration
   ➡General features

- Penetration of ulcer through bowel wall without free perforation or leakage of luminal
  contents into peritoneal cavity
- Occurs in descending order of frequency into adjacent organs - Pancreas > Lesser omentum > Biliary tract > Liver > Greater omentum >
  Mesocolon > Colon > Vascular structures
- Leads to complications such as pancreatitis or cholangitis
  ➡Surgical treatment
- **NOT** recommended

398

IX. **Prevention**

1. Prevention by different causes
   ➡ H. pylori ulcers - H. pylori eradication - Maintenance acid suppression therapy with PPI is **NOT** necessary
   ➡ NSAIDs ulcers - Review the need for NSAIDs - Avoid NSAIDs in patients with high GI risks or prior complicated peptic ulcer - High GI risks defined by > 2 of the following: Age > 65, previous history or peptic ulcer disease, high dose NSAIDS, concomitant use of aspirin, corticosteroids or anti-coagulants - Add PPI or misoprostol as prophylaxis with NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitor use
   ➡ Aspirin ulcers - Review the need for aspirin - Add PPI as prophylaxis with aspirin use
   ➡ Idiopathic ulcers - Maintenance acid suppression therapy with PPI in long-term

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Gastric cancer

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ 3 Most common primary malignant gastric neoplasm are adenocarcinoma (95%), lymphoma (4%) and malignant GIST (1%)
   ➡ Majority of patients are symptomatic and have advanced incurable disease at the time of presentation - 50% of patients have disease extends beyond locoregional confines at diagnosis - Half of these 50% of patients can undergo a potentially curative resection
   ➡ Location of gastric cancer: _Proximal (30%)_; _Middle (30%)_; _Distal (40%)_ - Previously distal predominant but there is proximal migration of tumours in recent years
   ➡ Modes of spread - **Hematogenous** spread - Liver (portal blood will be filtered by liver) - Lung (Lymphangitis carcinomatosis) - **Direct** spread - Small intestine/ Colon - Pancreas - Spleen - Liver - Kidney - Adrenal gland - Diaphragm - **Lymphatic** spread - Perigastric lymph nodes → Nodes along branches of celiac artery → Para-aortic lymph nodes - **Transcoelomic** spread (Peritoneal seedling) - Peritoneum (Peritoneal carcinomatosis) - Umbilicus (Sister Mary Joseph nodules) - Ovary (Krukenberg's tumour) - Cul-de-sac (Blumer's shelf)
   ➡ Spread of gastric cancer - **Common:** Liver/ Peritoneum/ LN - **Uncommon:** Brain/ Lung/ Ovary/ Bone

[Image Description: The number 400 is at the bottom right of the page.]

2. Special types of gastric cancer
   ➡ Linitis plastica (5%)

- Aggressive form of poorly-differentiated diffuse-type gastric cancer
- Broad region of gastric wall is extensively infiltrated by malignancy resulting in a rigid thickened stomach termed linitis plastica ("leather bottle" stomach)
- Difficult to be diagnosed with upper endoscopy and barium swallow is superior
  - Tumours tend to infiltrate the submucosa and muscularis propria and therefore superficial mucosal biopsy can be FP
  - Combination of strip and bite biopsy technique should be used be used when there is a suspicion of a diffuse type of gastric cancer
- Poor prognosis
  - Late presentation with advanced stage at diagnosis
  - Potential for early spread with 1/3 of patients having metastatic disease to peritoneum (malignant ascites) at diagnosis
  - Presence of microscopic disease at surgical margins due to its diffuse nature

II. Epidemiology

1. Hong Kong's epidemiology
   ➡ M: F ratio = 1.5: 1
   ➡ Incidence rate in HK (2014)

- Overall: 6th most common cancer
- Male: 5th most common cancer
- Female: 9th most common cancer
  ➡ Mortality rate in HK (2014)
- Male: 5th most common cancer
- Female: 5th most common cancer

[Image Description: The image is a standard page with text from a medical document, likely a textbook or a study guide, with a page number at the bottom right corner.]

III. Etiology

1. Risk factors
   ➡ Infection

- H. pylori infection (**major**)
- EBV infection (_10%_)
  ➡ Gastrointestinal diseases
- Gastric ulcers
- Atrophic gastritis
  - ○ **MOST** common precursor for gastric cancer particularly intestinal subtype
- Intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia
- Adenomatous polyps
- Menetrier's disease (protein-losing hypertrophic gastropathy)
  ➡ Familial history
- Family history of gastric cancer
- Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer
  - ○ Mutation in E-cadherin gene
  - ○ Prophylactic total gastrectomy should be considered
- Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
- Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) (Lynch syndrome)
  ➡ Dietary factors
- Nitrates compounds (Preserved food)
- Pickled food
- Smoked and salted food
  ➡ Social factors
- Obesity
- Smoking
- Alcoholism
- Low socioeconomic status
  ➡ Surgical history
- Previous partial gastrectomy or gastrojejunostomy
  - ○ Allow reflux of bile causing chronic gastritis

2. Protective factors
   ➡ Dietary factors

- Fresh fruits and vegetables
- Vitamin C
- Trace elements (e.g. selenium)

[Image Description: A small "402" is at the bottom right corner of the image.]

IV. **Pathophysiology**

1. Anatomy of stomach

[Diagram of a stomach with various parts labeled. The parts are colored differently. Esophagus is yellow, cardia is green, fundus is red, body is blue and pyloric antrum is purple. The short gastric artery, left gastric artery, right gastric artery, left gastro-omental (gastroepiploic) artery, and right gastro-omental (gastroepiploic) artery are pointing towards the corresponding arteries. The duedenum is pointing towards the location of duedenum]

➡**Arterial** supply

- Greater curvature
  - Short gastric artery
  - Left gastro-omental (gastroepiploic) artery
  - Right gastro-omental (gastroepiploic) artery
- Lesser curvature
  - Left gastric artery
  - Right gastric artery

➡ **Nerve** supply

- Sympathetic nerve supply
  - Greater splanchnic nerve (T5 – 9 sympathetic trunk)
- Parasympathetic nerve supply
  - **Anterior** vagal nerve: Stomach + Pylorus + Liver
  - **Posterior** vagal nerve: Stomach + Foregut and midgut down to splenic flexure

V. **Pathogenesis**

1. Carcinogenesis of gastric cancer
   ➡ Overview of carcinogenesis - Normal → Chronic superficial gastritis → Atrophic gastritis → Intestinal metaplasia →
   Intestinal dysplasia → Cancer
2. Gastric polyps
   ➡ Represents < 2% of all gastric tumours and usually located in the antrum or corpus
   ➡ Neoplastic polyps - Adenomatous polyp - Premalignant lesions - Incidence of carcinoma is proportional to its size with polyps > 2 cm having 24%
   incidence of malignancy - Patients with FAP have a high prevalence of gastric adenomatous polyps (50%)
   and are 10x more likely to develop adenocarcinoma than general population - Fundic gland polyp - Commonly seen in patients on long-term PPIs - Generally not pre-malignant with sporadic fundic gland polyps and those
   associated with PPI virtually having no malignant potential - May rarely show dysplasia especially in patients with FAP
   ➡ Non-neoplastic polyps - Hyperplastic polyp - MOST common accounting for 75% of gastric polyps - Usually occurs in the setting of chronic inflammation - Minimal risk of malignant transformation through dysplasia/ carcinoma sequence - Large hyperplastic polyps (> 2 cm) may harbour dysplasia or carcinoma-in-situ
   and gastric cancer may develop remote from the hyperplastic polyp in an area of
   associated chronic inflammation - Inflammatory polyp - Little or no malignant potential - Hamartomatous polyp - Little or no malignant potential
   ➡ Management - **ALL** gastric polyps ≥ 1 cm should be removed by polypectomy - Remove to confirm the diagnosis and to eliminate any risk of malignant
   degeneration - Endoscopic removal is appropriate if the polyp can be completely excised - Surgical resection with a 2 – 3 cm margin of gastric wall can be performed
   laparoscopically if endoscopic excision is not possible

Remarks:
➡Tumour may penetrate muscularis propria with extension into the gastrocolic or gastrohepatic
ligaments, or into the greater or lesser omentum, without perforation of the visceral peritoneum
covering these structures Classified as T3
➡Tumour that has perforation of visceral peritoneum covering the gastric ligaments or the
omentum Classified as T4
➡Adjacent structures of stomach include the spleen, transverse colon, liver, diaphragm, pancreas,
abdominal wall, adrenal gland, kidney, small intestine and retroperitoneum
➡ Intramural extension to duodenum or esophagus is NOT considered invasion of adjacent
structure but is classified using the depth of the greatest invasion in any of these sites

4. Classification of EGJ and cardia cancers

[Illustration of three different types of gastroesophageal junction (EGJ) and cardia cancers. The first illustration shows Type I, with the cancer located high up in the esophagus near the EGJ. The second illustration shows Type II, with the cancer centered at the EGJ. The third illustration shows Type III, with the cancer located in the stomach but involving the EGJ. Each illustration shows the stomach and esophagus with the location of the tumor highlighted in red, and the EGJ labeled.]

➡ AJCC/UICC TNM staging (8th edition, 2017)

- Tumors involving the EGJ with the tumor epicenter no more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as **esophageal cancer**
- EGJ tumors with their epicenter located more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as **stomach cancer**
  - As with all cardia cancers not involving the EGJ, even if they involve the EGJ are also staged as stomach cancer

➡ Siewert classification

- Type I = Located between 5 and 1 cm proximal to anatomical Z-line
  - Adenocarcinoma of distal esophagus usually arise from area with specialized intestinal metaplasia of esophagus (Barrett's esophagus) and may infiltrate the EGJ from above
  - Treatment = Transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy + Partial gastrectomy + 2-field lymphadenectomy
- Type II = Located between 1 cm proximal and 2 cm distal to the anatomical Z-line
  - True carcinoma of cardia arising from the cardiac epithelium or short segments with intestinal metaplasia at the EGJ
  - Treatment = Transabdominal/ Transhiatal resection of the distal esophagus + Total gastrectomy + Lymphadenectomy of the lower mediastinum and the abdominal D2 nodal compartment
- Type III = Located between 2 and 5 cm distal to anatomical Z-line
  - Subcardial gastric carcinoma that infiltrates the EGJ and distal esophagus from below
  - Treatment = Transabdominal/ Transhiatal resection of the distal esophagus + Total gastrectomy + Lymphadenectomy of the lower mediastinum and the abdominal D2 nodal compartment

   ➡ Lauren classification (of gastric adenocarcinoma)

- Intestinal type
  - Well-differentiated tumour
  - Occurs in elderly males and in distal stomach (causing GOO)
  - Tends to be less aggressive than the diffuse type
  - Hematogenous spread to distant organs is seen
  - Appears to be initiated by H. pylori infection characterized by a defined series of preneoplastic stages including acute and chronic gastritis → atrophic gastritis → intestinal metaplasia → intestinal dysplasia → gastric cancer
- Diffuse type - Undifferentiated tumour - Occurs in young females and in proximal stomach - More aggressive with worse overall prognosis - Transmural and lymphatic spread with early metastasis are more common - Lack of adhesion molecules in diffuse carcinoma allows individual tumour cell to grow and invade neighbouring structures without formation of tubules or glands - Presence of signet ring when intracellular mucin is abundant such that it pushes aside the nucleus of individual cells

VII. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Cachexia
- Jaundice
  - Distant metastasis to liver
- Lymphadenopathy
  - Left supraclavicular adenopathy (Virchow's node)
  - Periumbilical node (Sister Mary Joseph's node) (infiltration to umbilicus)
  - Left axillary node (Irish node)
    ➡Abdominal examination
- Palpable epigastric mass
  - Most common physical finding
  - Indicates long-standing, advanced disease
- Hepatomegaly
  - Distant metastasis of liver
- Ascites
  - Distant metastasis to peritoneum leading to peritoneal carcinomatosis
- Succussion splash
  - Indicates gastric outlet obstruction
- Krukenberg's tumour
  - Peritoneal spread presents with an enlarged ovary known as Krukenberg's tumour
    ➡Per rectal examination (DRE)
- PR bleed (melena)
- Blumer's shelf
  - Blumer's shelf refers to shelf-like tumour of anterior rectal wall
  - Mass in the Pouch of Douglas (rectouterine/ rectovaginal) on rectal examination

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials

- Hypochromic microcytic anemia
  - Iron-deficiency anemia due to hematemesis or melena
    ➡ Clotting profile
    ➡Electrolyte profile
- Vomiting leading to deranged electrolyte profile secondary to gastric outlet obstruction
  ➡LFT
- Evaluate for liver metastasis and biliary obstruction
- Albumin as marker for nutritional status
  ➡ RFT
- Evaluate for membranous nephropathy (nephrotic syndrome) which is one of the paraneoplastic syndrome
  ➡Tumour marks
- CEA and CA125 are **NOT** useful in diagnosis
- Useful in follow-up after surgery to monitor recurrence and monitoring response to chemotherapy

412

3. Radiological tests
   ➡Oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD) + Biopsy (**Establish diagnosis**)

- Tissue diagnosis and anatomical localization of primary tumour
- Suspicious gastric ulcer should always be biopsied
- Endoscopic technique for linitis plastica - Linitis plastica is a diffuse-type gastric cancer which infiltrate the submucosa and
  muscularis propria rather than superficial mucosa - Combination of strip and bite biopsy should be used to prevent FN results
  ➡Double-contrast barium meal (**Establish diagnosis**)
- Identify both malignant gastric ulcers and infiltrating lesions
- Limited diagnostic value EXCEPT for linitis plastica in which barium meal is superior to
  OGD with biopsy for diagnosis
  ➡Endoscopic USG (EUS)\* (**Staging**: T/N)
- **GOLD** standard for T staging
  - Most accurate method to evaluate depth of invasion of gastric cancer
- Identify involvement of perigastric and celiac lymph nodes for N staging but is
  suboptimal for distant lymph nodes
  ➡CT scan thorax, abdomen and pelvis (T + A + P) with contrast (**Staging**: M)
- Evaluate widely metastatic disease such as liver or adnexal metastasis, distal nodal spread
  and malignant ascites
- NOT accurate in determining the T and N stage for staging of gastric cancer
  ➡PET-CT scan (**Staging**: M)
- Use of 18-FDG in determining M stage for staging of gastric cancer
- Useful to confirm malignant involvement of CT-detected lymphadenopathy
  ➡Staging laparoscopy + Peritoneal cytology (**Staging**: M)
- Usually indicated in EUS stage T3/4
- Peritoneal washings with cytology should be performed in patients receiving preoperative
  therapy as well as in advanced cancer T3 or N1 disease
- Role in diagnostic staging of gastric cancer - Direct visualization of liver surface, peritoneum and local LN and permitting
  biopsy of any suspicious lesions - Detects small volume of peritoneal and liver metastasis which is more accurate
  than CT scan
  ➡CXR (**Staging**: M)
- Pleural effusion
- Lymphangitis carcinomatosis

VIII. Treatment

1. General approach
   ➡Palliative management

- Indicated for patients with unequivocal evidence of incurability including metastasis, involvement of peritoneum and N4 nodal stage disease
- Bleeding
  - Transcatheter embolization
  - External beam radiotherapy (EBRT)
  - Palliative gastrectomy
- Gastric outlet obstruction
  - Endoscopic laser ablation
  - Endoscopic self-expanding metallic stent placement
  - Palliative gastrectomy
  - Palliative bypass with gastrojejunostomy

2. Medical treatment
   ➡Neoadjuvant therapy

- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy - Indicated in T3 (transmural) tumours or N1 tumours (LN involvement) - Increase resectability rate by downstaging the tumour - Reduce rate of local and distant recurrence - Chemotherapy regimen = 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) + Epirubicin + Cisplatin
  ➡Adjuvant therapy
- Adjuvant chemoradiation
  - Indicated in ALL patients except those with (T1 – 2; N0; M0) disease since majority of patients with locoregional disease are at high risk of local and systemic recurrence following curative surgery
  - Improves overall and disease-free survival rate in resected gastric cancer
  - Regimen = 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)/ Leucovorin + Radiation therapy

3. Endoscopic treatment
   ➡ Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) / Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)

- Early gastric cancer that is confined to the mucosa and have limited propensity for lymph node metastasis can be treated by endoscopic mucosal resection
- Indications
  - Patients with tumours < 2 cm in size that are node negative and confined to mucosa on endoscopic USG (EUS)
- EMR VS ESD
  - ESD permits en bloc resection of large tumours which cannot be managed by EMR due to high risk and high recurrence rate
  - ESD permits a deeper resection margin with submucosal involvement and a higher resection rates

414

4. Surgical treatment
   ➡ General principles

- Surgery is the primary treatment in the absence of distant metastasis
  - Many patients with positive LN are cured by adequate surgery
- Complete resection with negative microscopic margins with adequate lymphadenectomy
  - Gross negative margins of ≥ 5 cm is required
  - En bloc resection of adjacent involved organs such as distal pancreas, transverse colon or spleen is indicated in T4 tumours
- Indicators of unresectability - Presence of distant metastasis - Invasion of major vascular structure including aorta - Encasement or occlusion of hepatic artery, celiac axis or proximal splenic artery
  ➡ Extent of lymphadenectomy
- Draining lymph nodes for stomach is divided into 16 stations with station 1 - 6 are perigastric and the remaining 10 located adjacent to major vessels, behind the pancreas and along the aorta
- Different extent of lymphadenectomy
  - D1 lymphadenectomy = Perigastric LNs dissection
  - D2 lymphadenectomy = D1 + Removal of LNs along celiac trunk, common hepatic, splenic, left gastric arteries and those LNs in splenic hilum
  - D3 lymphadenectomy = D2 + Removal of LNs in porta hepatis and periaortic regions
- D2 lymphadenectomy is the STANDARD of care in patients with potentially curable gastric caner which entails removal of 15 LNs
  - Better disease-specific survival BUT with a higher perioperative mortality
  - Allows more accurate N staging of the disease extent to minimize stage migration (≥ 15 lymph nodes are required for adequate staging)
  - Avoid leaving disease behind with a more extended lymphadenectomy (D2 and 3)

415

➡Gastrectomy (Total VS Subtotal)

- **Proximal tumours** = Total gastrectomy
  - Tumours of EGJ requires esophagogastrectomy
  - Proximal subtotal gastrectomy is **NOT** preferred due to poor functional outcomes despite technically feasible
    - Requires esophagogastrostomy to a vagotomised distal gastric remnant in which pyloroplasty in this setting will literally guarantees bile esophagitis
    - On the other hand if the pylorus is left intact then gastric emptying will be problematic
- **Midbody tumours** = Total gastrectomy
- **Distal tumours** = Subtotal gastrectomy
  - Subtotal gastrectomy has similar surgical outcomes but decreased complications as compared to total gastrectomy
  - Total gastrectomy adds NO additional survival benefit and may have adverse nutritional or QOL issues and higher perioperative morbidity and mortality

➡ Afferent loop syndrome

- Occurs in Billroth II reconstruction
- Mechanical obstruction of afferent limb due to kinking, anastomotic narrowing, adhesions, volvulus or internal herniation
- Presents with post-prandial epigastric pain, nausea and non-bilious vomiting (bilious after obstruction is relieved) within first few weeks after surgery
- Can leads to complications including duodenal stump blowout, obstructive jaundice, ascending cholangitis and pancreatitis
  - Duodenal stump blowout occurs from progressive afferent limb dilation leading to peritonitis, abscess or fistula formation
  - Results of transmission of high pressure back to biliopancreatic ductal system
- Managed by conversion to Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy
  ➡ Efferent loop syndrome
- Results from intermittent obstruction of efferent limb of the gastrojejunostomy
- Resents with abdominal pain and bilious vomiting months to years after surgery similar to situations with regard to proximal small bowel obstruction
  ➡ Roux-stasis syndrome
- Results from functional obstruction due to disruption of normal propagation and propulsive activity in Roux limb as well as altered motility in the gastric remnant
- Disorder motility of Roux loop with net propulsive activity proximal rather than distal away from stomach
- Presents with chronic abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting that is aggravated with eating
  ➡ Early satiety
- Inadequate reservoir function
- Recommend patients to have small frequent meals
  ➡ Post-vagotomy diarrhea
- Occurs in 20% after truncal vagotomy
- Results from alteration in gastric emptying and vagal denervation of small bowel and biliary tree
- Diarrhea is typically watery and episodic
- Managed with decreasing excessive intake of fluids or food that contain lactose and antidiarrheal medications

➡ Post-operative management

- NPO till POD 3 – 5 followed by escalation of feed to diet to choice
- Vitamin B12 supplementation
- Iron tablet supplementation

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST)

I. Overview

1. Overview of stromal and mesenchymal neoplasms
   ➡ Stromal and mesenchymal neoplasm affecting the GIT can be divided broadly into two groups

- More common group include neoplasms that are collectively referred to as gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST)
- Less common group include neoplasms that are identical to those that might arise in soft tissues throughout rest of the body
  - Include lipoma, liposarcoma, leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, desmoid tumour, schwannoma and peripheral nerve sheath tumour

2. Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST)
   ➡ **MOST** common non-epithelial (subepithelial) neoplasm involving the GIT

- Accounts for only 1% of all primary GI cancers
- Arise from muscularis propria same as leiomyoma
  ➡ Occurs throughout GIT from esophagus to anus
- Stomach (40 – 60%)
- Jejunum/ Ileum (25 – 30%)
- Duodenum (5%)
- Colorectum (5 – 15%)
- Esophagus (≤ 1%)
- Extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumour (EGIST) - Omentum/ Mesentery/ Retroperitoneum
  ➡ Derived from the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC)
- ICC forms the interface between autonomic innervation of bowel wall and smooth muscle
- Consists of features of both neuronal differentiation and smooth muscle which serve to regulate peristalsis (also known as GI pacemaker cells)
  ➡ Biological behaviors
- Terms including benign or malignant should **NOT** applied to GIST
- Previously thought to be benign but virtually all GISTs have the potential for malignant behavior and thus now regarded as "potentially malignant"
- Site of metastasis - Frequently metastasize to liver, peritoneum, omentum - Rarely metastasize to regional LNs - Rarely metastasize to lung which in contrast is the most common site of metastasis for most of the other soft tissues sarcoma
  ➡ Defined by the presence of activating mutation in the KIT genes or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) genes
- Majority of GIST (80%) have KIT gene mutation
- Minority of GIST that are KIT -ve have activating mutation in a different gene that encodes an receptor tyrosine kinase which is PDGFRA
- Remaining GIST (10 – 15%) do not have a detectable KIT or PDGFRA mutation and is known as wild-type tumours
  ➡ Association with other conditions (mainly wild-type tumours)
- Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)
- Carney-Stratakis syndrome
- Carney triad (GIST + Pulmonary chondroma + Extra-adrenal paraganglioma)

421

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ Occurs predominantly in middle-aged to older individuals

- Mean age of diagnosis = 63
- Rare in individuals under the age of 40

III. Etiology

1. Differential diagnosis of subepithelial tumour arising in GIT other than GIST
   ➡ Liposarcoma
   ➡ Leiomyoma
   ➡Leiomyosarcoma
   ➡Desmoid tumour (fibromatosis)
   ➡Schwannoma
   ➡Peripheral nerve sheath tumour

IV. Pathogenesis

1. Histopathology of GIST
   ➡ CD117 antigen* (95%) - Near-universal expression of CD117 antigens by GIST - CD117 antigen is part of the KIT transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that is the product of the KIT (c-kit) protooncogene - Contrast to other stromal and mesenchymal neoplasms such as leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma which typically lack KIT gene mutation and fail to express KIT proteins (CD 117 -ve)
   ➡ CD34 antigen (~66%) - Neither selective nor specific for GIST
   ➡ DOG-1* (~100%) - Near-universal expression in all GIST including KIT -ve PDGFRA-mutant tumour
   [Image Description: The image is a blank white page containing the number "422" in the bottom right corner.]

2. TNM staging of GIST (2017)

**Primary tumour (T)**
TX ➡ Primary tumour cannot be assessed
TO ➡ No evidence of primary tumour
T1 ➡ Tumour ≤ 2 cm
T2 ➡ Tumour > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm
T3 ➡ Tumour > 5 cm but ≤ 10 cm
T4 ➡ Tumour > 10 cm in greatest dimension

**Regional lymph node (N)**
NO ➡ No regional lymph node metastasis or unknown lymph node status
N1 ➡ Metastasis in regional lymph nodes

**Distant metastasis (M)**
MO ➡ No distant metastasis

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. **Signs and symptoms**
   ➡ Upper GI bleeding

- **MOST** common clinical presentation
  ➡ Abdominal pain
  ➡ Abdominal mass
  ➡ Early satiety
  ➡ Bloating sensation

2. **Signs and symptoms of obstruction**
   ➡ Tumour can act as an intramural cause of obstruction or as a lead point for intussusception

- Abdominal pain
- Abdominal distention
- Vomiting
- Constipation

VI. Diagnosis

1. Radiological tests
   ➡Endoscopic USG + Fine needle aspiration (FNA)

- **MOST** accurate method for diagnosis
- Combined use of cytologic analysis and immunohistochemistry for KIT mutations permit diagnosis of lesions retrieved from endoscopic USG-guided FNA
- Preoperative FNA or biopsy may not be necessary if a mesenchymal GI tumour is strongly suspected in which resection is more appropriate
- FNA or biopsy is indicated if - Preoperative imatinib is considered prior to attempted resection of a large locally advanced lesion thought to represent a GIST - Clearly unresectable disease in which imatinib is considered - Metastatic disease in which imatinib is considered
  ➡ OGD
- GIST appears as a mass with smooth margins with normal overlying mucosa and bulging into the gastric lumen with or without central ulceration
- Endoscopic biopsy typically does **NOT** obtain tissues for a definite diagnosis
  ➡CT/MRI scan
- Characterization of abdominal mass, evaluate its extent and the presence and absence of metastatic disease
- CT is preferred over MRI as initial imaging study for screening and staging since it is better at global evaluation of abdominal especially the hollow viscera
  - GIST appears to be a solid smoothly contoured mass with contrast enhancement
  - Leiomyoma appears to be a smoothly contoured hypodense lesion immediately adjacent to the gut lumen
  - Leiomyosarcoma appears to be a large mass with varying degrees of internal necrosis with heterogeneous contrast enhancement
- MRI is preferred for GIST located at fixed structures such as liver and rectum in which MRI can provide better anatomical definition
  ➡PET scan
- Use of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to detect tumours with a high glucose metabolism which includes GIST
- Not specific to make a diagnosis and cannot replace CT as initial imaging modality of choice

VII. Treatment

1. Medical treatment
   ➡ Targeted therapy

- Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
- Example: Imatinib/ Sunitinib
- Neoadjuvant imatinib
- Preferred if the tumour is borderline resectable or if resection would necessitate extensive organ disruption
- Beneficial for tumours located in esophagus, EGJ, duodenum or distal rectum
- Reduce the size of tumour to facilitate surgery or increase likelihood of organ preservation
- Adjuvant imatinib
- Indicated in patients with high risk of relapse such as GIST ≥ 3 cm in size
- Marked decrease in recurrence rate with 1 year of adjuvant treatment
- Palliative imatinib
- 1st line treatment for metastatic GIST which can control tumour growth

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Surgical resection

- Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for potentially resectable tumours
- Abdomen should be thoroughly explored during laparotomy with particular attention to the liver and peritoneum to exclude metastatic spread
- ALL GIST ≥ 2 cm in size should be resected
- GIST < 1 cm can be follow-up conservatively
  ➡ Lymph node dissection
- NEITHER necessary or beneficial since LN metastasis is rare

I. Overview

1. General features

# Jaundice and bilirubin metabolism

[Graph showing the relation between age in days vs total serum bilirubin in mg/dL. The x axis is labelled "Age" ranging from Birth to 7 days. The y axis is labelled "Total serum bilirubin (mg/dL)" ranging from 10 to 30. The y axis on the right is labeled "μmol/L" ranging from 171 to 513. There are three lines, each representing the bilirubin level of different risk groups: "Infants at lower risk (≥ 38 wk and well)", "Infants at medium risk (≥ 38 wk + risk factors or 35-37 6/7 wk and well)", and "Infants at higher risk (35-37 6/7 wk + risk factors)". The lower risk line is a dotted line that increases slowly over time. The medium risk line is a dashed line that rises more sharply than the dotted line. The higher risk line is a solid line that is even lower than the other two lines.]

➡Jaundice results from bilirubin deposition in skin or conjunctiva

- Unconjugated bilirubin = **Yellow** (Bright yellow or orange)
- Conjugated bilirubin (Obstructive) = **Yellow** with green hue (Greenish or muddy yellow)
  ➡Neonatal jaundice (NMJ)
- **Prevalence** = Jaundice is observed during the 1st week after birth in 50 – 60% of term infants and 80% of preterm infants
- Jaundice is visible in neonates when it reaches 80 – 100 µmol/L
- Becomes apparent in a cephalocaudal progression as serum bilirubin increases
  - _Face_ = 85 µmol/L; _Mid-abdomen_ = 256 µmol/L; _Soles_ = 342 µmol/L
- Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in infants ≥ 35 weeks of gestational age is defined as serum total bilirubin > 95th percentile on the hour-specific Bhutani nomogram
- Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is defined as serum total bilirubin > 428 µmol/L (25 mg/dL)
  - ↑ Risk of bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND)
    - Acute bilirubin encephalopathy is the acute form and reversible manifestation of BIND
    - Kernicterus is a chronic form and irreversible sequelae of BIND

II. Pathophysiology

[Illustration of bilirubin production and metabolism. The illustration depicts the liver at the top, with labels indicating "Daily bilirubin production 200-400 mg". Arrows show the flow of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. "Conjugated bilirubin 260 mg/day" and "Unconjugated bilirubin" are labeled. Enterohepatic recycling is indicated with arrows pointing back to the liver. Below the liver is the small intestine and colon, illustrating the conversion to Urobilinogen. Arrows point to "Urinary urobilinogen 0-4 mg/day" and "Fecal urobilinogen 125-130 mg/day". "Systemic circulation" is shown, and the process of Urobilinogen circulation is also highlighted.]

1. Bilirubin production
   ➡Bilirubin is formed by breakdown of heme present in haemoglobin (Hb) (80-90%), myoglobin,
   cytochrome, catalase and peroxidase

- Heme → Biliverdin + CO by heme oxygenase
  - Heme oxygenase is an enzyme that is present in reticuloendothelial cells of spleen
    and Kupffer cells of liver
  - Measurement of CO production can be used as indices of bilirubin production
- Biliverdin → Bilirubin by biliverdin reductase

2. Bilirubin metabolism
   ➡ Binding of bilirubin to albumin

- Binding to albumin and high-density lipoprotein keeps bilirubin in solution in plasma
  - Binding to high density lipoprotein is significant in hypoalbuminemia
- Significance
  - Prevention of bilirubin deposition into extrahepatic tissue including the brain
  - Transport bilirubin to sinusoidal surface of hepatocytes where it dissociated from
    albumin and enters into hepatocytes

➡Uptake and storage of bilirubin by hepatocytes

- Bilirubin is taken by hepatocytes by facilitated diffusion which is not energy-consuming,
  bidirectional and cannot occur against a concentration gradient

➡ Conjugation of bilirubin

- Bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid into bilirubin diglucuronide by UDP-
  glucuronosyl transferase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes
- Conjugated bilirubin is more water-soluble than unconjugated bilirubin and hence is
  excreted in bile into the gut

427

3. Bilirubin excretion
   ➡Conjugated bilirubin is excreted in bile in an active process that depends upon canalicular
   transporter and then excreted into digestive tract

- Conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and cannot be reabsorbed across the lipid
  membrane of the small intestine epithelium
  ➡Conjugated bilirubin is deconjugated into urobilinogen by intestinal bacterial enzymes known as
  ẞ-glucuronidase in distal ileum and colon
- Infants gut is sterile without intestinal bacteria but ẞ-glucuronidase in indigenous in the
  small intestinal mucosa in the newborn
- Urobilinogen is a water-soluble colorless compound which can be further oxidized into
  urobilin which is orange-yellow in color
  ➡Consequences of urobilinogens
- Enterohepatic circulation
  - 10 – 20% of urobilinogens are reabsorbed into intestines, enters the portal venous
    blood via portal vein and re-excreted by the liver
- Excretion in feces
  - 80– 90% of urobilinogens are excreted in feces as fecal urobilinogen (=
    stercobilinogen)
  - Fecal urobilinogen (stercobilinogen) is oxidized into urobilin (stercobilin) to give
    feces the brown colouration
- Excretion in urine
  - Remaining small fraction of urobilinogens that is not cleared by liver enters
    systemic circulation, filters across renal glomerulus and excreted in urine as
    urinary urobilinogens
    ➡Pathophysiology of dark urine and pale stools
- Dark urine
  - Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (water soluble) which is excreted in urine when
    there is near-complete biliary obstruction such that no urobilinogen can be formed
    from the GIT
  - Inefficient hepatic clearance of the reabsorbed urobilinogen through bile and GIT
    leading to increased urinary excretion of urobilinogen
- Pale stools (clay-colored)
  - ↓ Deconjugation of conjugated bilirubin by bacterial enzymes (β-glucuronidase)
    into urobilinogens in the colon
  - ↓ Fecal urobilinogens (stercobilinogen) and subsequently urobilin (stercobilin)
    leading to discoloration

428

III. Causes of jaundice (Children)

1. Physiological jaundice (Icterus neonatorum)
   ➡General features

- Non-pathological jaundice is caused by normal neonatal changes in bilirubin metabolism
- Visible and apparent at Day 2-3 and peaks at day 4-5
- Asians (D4-5) tend to have a later peak compared with Caucasians (D2 - 4)
- Resolves within 1-2 weeks after birth
  - < 2 weeks = Neonatal jaundice (NMJ)
  - > 2 weeks = Prolonged neonatal jaundice (NMJ)
    > ➡Pathophysiology
- ↑ Bilirubin production
  - Newborn have more RBCs with hematocrit between 50-60%
  - Fetal RBCs have a shorter life-span than adults with increased turnover and breakdown of RBCS
- ↓Bilirubin clearance
  - Deficiency of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
- ↑ Enterohepatic circulation
  - Feeding is minimal in first few days of life and gut motility is impaired
  - Increase in transit time of conjugated bilirubin within intestine leads to increased deconjugation by β-glucuronidase and bilirubin is reabsorbed into circulation
  - Impaired excretion of bilirubin in feces leads to hyperbilirubinemia
    ➡Risk factors for NMJ
- Male gender
- Maternal age ≥ 25 years old
- Prematurity (Gestational age 35 - 36 weeks)
- Gestation DM
- Cephalohematoma or significant bruising
- Exclusive breastfeeding
- Blood group incompatibility
  ➡Laboratory findings
- Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
- Normal hepatic parenchymal and ductal enzymes
- Peripheral blood smear shows no evidence of hemolysis

                                    *   ➡Polycythemia
                                        *   ↑ Red cell load leading to increased hemolysis

                                    *   ➡ Sepsis
                                        *   Increased oxidative stress due to sepsis damages neonatal RBC which are susceptible to cellular injury
                                        *   Risk factors for sepsis include GBS colonization during pregnancy

↑ Enterohepatic ➡Breastmilk jaundice
circulation

- Traditionally defined as persistence of physiological jaundice beyond the 1-2 weeks of age (late-jaundice)
- Presents within day 3 - 5 and peaks within 2 weeks after birth
- Progressively declines to normal level over 3 - 12 weeks
- Benign condition and mother should be advised to continue breastfeeding based on other beneficial effects of breastmilk
- Mechanism - Ο ẞ-glucuronidase present in breastmilk deconjugates bilirubin and promotes intestinal reabsorption by enterohepatic circulation
  ➡Breastfeeding jaundice
- Occurs in the 1st week after birth in breastfed infants (early-jaundice)
- Breast milk supply may be inadequate during first few days of life leading to failure in initiating breastfeeding
- Lactation failure leads to inadequate intake with significant weight and fluid loss resulting in hypovolemia and hyperbilirubinemia
- Mechanism - Inadequate milk intake leads to sluggish bowel movement - Increase in transit time of conjugated bilirubin within intestine leads to increased deconjugation by ẞ-glucuronidase and bilirubin is reabsorbed into circulation (↑ Enterohepatic circulation)
  ➡Intestinal obstruction
- Pyloric stenosis
- Paralytic ileus

V. Differentiation between unconjugated and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia

1. History taking
   ➡Gestational history

- Gestational DM
- GBS colonization
  ➡Perinatal history
- Birth trauma (cephalohematoma)
  ➡ Birth history
- Birth weight
- Age of life
  - Cutoff for bilirubin is different in first few days of life
- Feeding details
  - Breastfeeding or formula milk
  - Volume of frequency of feeding
  - Urinary and bowel opening
    ➡ Medical history
- Blood group incompatibility
- G6PD deficiency
- Congenital hypothyroidism

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡Features suggestive of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (due to hemolysis)

- ↑ AST
- ↑ Unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin
- ↑ LDH level
- ↑ Methemoglobin
  - Oxidized form of Hb in serum which occurs in intravascular hemolysis giving the
    serum a brownish color
- ↓ Haptoglobin
  - Free Hb binds to haptoglobin in which the haemoglobin-haptoglobin complex is
    rapidly removed by the liver leading to a reduction in plasma haptoglobin
    ➡Features suggestive of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia
- Urine bilirubin +ve
  - Unconjugated bilirubin is water insoluble
  - Conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and thus excreted in urine
    [Image of a horizontal line]

VI. Treatment

1. Medical treatment
   ➡ Phototherapy

- Bilirubin absorbs light maximally in the blue range (420-470 nm) which causes several
  photochemical Ireactions
- Phototherapy exposes infant's skin to light of a specific wavelength by 3 mechanisms
  - Photoisomerization of bilirubin into a less toxic bilirubin isomer
  - Structural isomerization of bilirubin into lumirubin which is more soluble to be excreted into bile and urine without conjugation
  - Photooxidation of bilirubin into polar molecules that are excreted in bile and urine
- Side effects - Corneal or retinal damage (eye-shield required) - Erythematous skin rash - Diarrhea - Hyperthermia - Dehydration - Increased insensible water loss and diarrhea - Bronze baby syndrome - Dark greyish-brown skin discoloration resulting from photo-induced modification of porphyrins that are present during cholestatic jaundice - Benign condition that occurs when using phototherapy for conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia
  ➡Exchange transfusion
- Most effective method for removing bilirubin but expensive and time-consuming
- Indicated when intensive phototherapy failed or infants develop signs of bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND) such as kernicterus
- Especially useful in infants with hyperbilirubinemia due to isoimmune hemolysis since circulating antibodies and sensitized RBC are also removed
- Potential complications - Infection - Electrolyte disturbances (Metabolic acidosis/ Hypoglycemia/ Hypocalcemia) - Arrhythmia - Volume overload - Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)
  ➡Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG)
- Adjunctive treatment for hyperbilirubinemia caused by isoimmune hemolytic disease
- Recommended when serum bilirubin is reaching exchange transfusion levels despite maximal interventions including phototherapy
- Reduces the need for exchange transfusion in infants with hemolytic disease caused by ABO or Rh(D) incompatibility presumably by reducing hemolysis

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡Kasai procedure (Portoenterostomy)

- Roux-en-Y loop of bowel is created to anastomose to liver hilum
- Restoration of bile flow from liver to proximal small bowel
  ➡Liver transplantation
- Biliary atresia remains the most common indication for pediatric liver transplantation
- Indicated in patients who fail Kasai procedure
  434

VII. **Complications**

1. **Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE)**
   ➡Mechanism
   - Unconjugated bilirubin that is not bound to albumin is hydrophobic and thus able to cross blood brain barrier (BBB) to cause cell death by apoptosis and necrosis
   - Conjugated bilirubin does **NOT** cause bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction
     ➡Clinical manifestation (**Acute** form)
   - **Early phase** (D1 – 2)
     - Hypotonia
     - Lethargy
     - Poor suck and feeding
     - Seizures
   - **Intermediate phase** (Middle of 1st week)
     - Fever
     - Hypertonia of extensor muscles
     - Backward arching of neck (Retrocollis) and trunk (Opisthotonos) with stimulation
   - **Advanced phase** (After 1st week)
     - Hypertonia
2. **Kernicterus**
   ➡Neurological syndrome resulting from deposition of unconjugated bilirubin in the basal ganglia and brainstem nuclei
   ➡Risk factors - Prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia - High level of free unbound bilirubin - Continuous hemolysis - Premature infants - Sepsis/ Acidosis/ Hypoglycemia
   ➡Clinical manifestation (**Chronic** form) - **Dyskinetic cerebral palsy (CP)** (Choreoathetosis type) - Movement disorders with choreoathetosis, ballismus and tremor - **Sensorineural hearing loss** - Auditory neuropathy with abnormal brainstem auditory-evoked response (BAER) and normal otoacoustic emission (OAE) - **Upward gaze palsy** - **Dental enamel dysplasia** - **Extrapyramidal signs** - Accumulation of bilirubin into basal ganglia

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Liver abscess

I. **Overview**

1.  General features
    ➡ Types of liver abscess
    - Pyogenic liver abscess
      - Most commonly involve the right lobe of liver because it is large and has greater blood supply than the left and caudate lobes
    - Amoebic liver abscess - Amebiasis is caused by protozoan Entamoeba histolytica - Most common extra-intestinal manifestation of amebiasis - Should be considered especially when patients travelled to an endemic area
      ➡ Route of spread
    - **Intraabdominal spread** = Spread to liver via portal vein circulation
      - Example: Peritonitis leading to bowel leakage/ Acute appendicitis/ Acute diverticulitis/ Pelvic abscess
    - **Direct spread** = Direct spread from biliary infection
      - Example: Gallstones/ Malignant obstruction
    - **Hematogenous spread** = Arterial hematogenous seeding in systemic infection
      - Example: Infective endocarditis
    - **External inoculation** = Iatrogenic or traumatic
      - Example: Surgical wound/ Penetrating wound

II. Epidemiology

1.  General features
    ➡ Most common type of visceral abscess

[Image Description: The page number "436" is located at the bottom right corner of the page.]

III. Etiology

1. Risk factors
   ➡ Diabetes mellitus (DM)
   ➡ Underlying hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease

   ⇨LFT - Hypoalbuminemia
   ➡Blood culture - Essential and positive in up to 50% of cases
   ➡Aspirate smear, culture and microscopy - CT or USG-guided fine needle aspiration - Smear and culture for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms - Microscopy for trophozoites
   ➡Serology and antigen detection for amebiasis - Presence of anti-amoebic antibodies - Detection of E. histolytica antigens
3. Radiological tests
   ⇨ CXR - Findings suggestive of liver abscess include elevate right hemidiaphragm, right basilar infiltrate and right-sided pleural effusion
   ➡Ultrasound abdomen - Diagnostic modalities of choice - Guide fine needle aspiration for microbial culture - Look for presence of septation and hypoechoic rim
   ➡CT abdomen - Diagnostic modalities of choice - Findings of liver abscess include fluid collection with surround edema with or without stranding and loculated subcollections - Must be distinguished from cysts and tumours - Cysts appears as fluid collections without surround stranding or hyperemia - Tumour has a solid radiographic appearance and may contains areas of calcification with fluid-filled appearance due to necrosis and bleeding - **CANNOT** differentiate between pyogenic and amoebic liver abscess
   [Image of the number 438 at the bottom right of the page.]

VI. Treatment

1. Medical treatment
   ➡ Empirical antibiotics (4 – 6 weeks: IV for first 2 weeks followed by oral for 4 weeks)

- Combination therapy with 3rd generation cephalosporin and metronidazole
  - Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole
- Monotherapy with ẞ-lactam/ ẞ-lactamase inhibitor
  - Ampicillin-sulbactam
  - Piperacillin-tazobactam
  - Ticarcillin-clavulanate

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Drainage of abscesses - Percutaneous drainage (FNA/ Catheter drainage) - Single abscess ≤ 5 cm in diameter: Either percutaneous catheter drainage or
   needle aspiration is acceptable and drainage catheter should remain in place until
   drainage is minimal usually up to 7 days - Single abscess > 5 cm in diameter: Percutaneous catheter drainage is preferred - Surgical drainage - Indicated in multiple abscess, loculated abscess, abscess with viscous contents
   obstructing the drainage catheter, inadequate response to percutaneous drainage
   within 7 days and underlying disease requiring surgery - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) drainage - Indicated in patients with previous biliary procedures whose infection
   communicates with the biliary tree
   VII. Complication
1. Complication of liver abscess
   ➡ Rupture of liver abscess - Abscess diameter > 6 cm and coexisting liver cirrhosis are main risk factors for rupture - Majority of rupture is perihepatic or into the pleural space
   ➡ Endophthalmitis (10%) - Metastatic infection from Klebsiella pneumoniae primary liver abscess (KLA)
1. Association with underlying conditions
   ➡ Colorectal cancer

- K. pneumoniae is the primary cause of pyogenic liver abscess in several parts of Asia and
  an association with underlying colorectal cancer is suggested
- Occult colorectal cancer should be considered in patients diagnosed with pyogenic liver
  abscess particularly due to K. pneumonia and in the absence of apparent underlying
  hepatobiliary disease

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Liver cirrhosis

I. Overview

1.  General features - ➡ Liver cirrhosis represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis - ➡ Characterized by bridging fibrosis, distortion of hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative nodules - ➡ Reversibility - Reversible in early stages following treatment of underlying cause - Irreversible in advanced stages at which only liver transplantation is the only treatment
    II. Etiology
1.  Risk factors for decompensation of cirrhosis
    - ➡ Bleeding
    - ➡ Dehydration
    - ➡ Infection
    - ➡ Obesity
    - ➡ Alcoholism
    - ➡ Medications

1.  Causes of liver cirrhosis
    - ➡ Liver diseases
      - Chronic hepatitis B infection (**most common**) (90%)
      - Chronic hepatitis C infection (4%)
      - Alcoholic liver disease (4%)
      - Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
      - Autoimmune hepatitis
      - Cryptogenic cirrhosis
        - Idiopathic and most likely are HBV carriers with loss of HBsAg or non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases
    - ➡ Biliary diseases
      - Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)
      - Secondary biliary cirrhosis (stones/ stricture/ neoplasm/ biliary atresia)
      - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
    - ➡ Endocrine diseases
      - Wilson's disease
      - Hemochromatosis
      - α1-antitrypsin deficiency
    - ➡ Vascular diseases
      - Budd-Chiari syndrome
      - Cardiac cirrhosis (Congestive hepatopathy)
        - Right-sided heart failure
        - MS/TR/ Constrictive pericarditis
    - ➡ Drug-induced
      - Methotrexate
      - Amiodarone

Note: Drugs such as methotrexate (MTX) can give rise to hepatic fibrosis **rather** than liver cirrhosis without distortion of liver architecture in fibrosis.

[Image Description: The image is a medical document about liver cirrhosis. It begins with a title "Gastrointestinal Diseases Liver cirrhosis".The document is divided into two main sections: "I. Overview" and "II. Etiology." The Overview section discusses the general features of liver cirrhosis, including its late-stage progression, characteristics like bridging fibrosis and regenerative nodules, and the concept of reversibility. The Etiology section covers risk factors for decompensation of cirrhosis and causes of liver cirrhosis, including liver diseases, biliary diseases, endocrine diseases, vascular diseases, and drug-induced factors. There is a note at the end saying: "Drugs such as methotrexate (MTX) can give rise to hepatic fibrosis rather than liver cirrhosis without distortion of liver architecture in fibrosis."]

### III. Clinical manifestation

1. Constitutional symptoms
   - Anorexia
   - Weight loss
   - Fatigue
   - Weakness
   - Muscle cramps
     - Patient with cirrhosis may experience muscle cramps
     - Related to reduction in effective circulatory plasma volume, nerve dysfunction and alteration in energy metabolism

2. Symptoms of chronic liver disease
   - Jaundice
   - Dark urine
     - Inefficient hepatic clearance of the reabsorbed urobilinogen through bile
     - ↑ Urinary excretion of urobilinogen
   - Pruritus
   - Bruising
   - **Male**: ↓ Libido/ Impotence/ Infertility
     - Result of hypogonadism
   - **Females**: Amenorrhea/ Oligomenorrhea
     - Result of chronic anovulation

3. Symptoms of cirrhosis complication
   - **Variceal bleeding**: Hematemesis/ Melena/ Hematochezia
   - **Ascites and edema**: Abdominal distension/ Lower extremity edema
   - **Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis**: Fever/ Abdominal pain/
   - **Hepatic encephalopathy**: Confusion/ Sleeping disturbance
     [Image of the number 441 at the bottom right of the page]

IV. **Pathogenesis**

1. **Pathophysiology of portal hypertension**
   ➡ Portal venous system - Portal venous system contributes 75% of blood to the liver - Measurement of portal pressure - Place a balloon catheter in the hepatic vein and measure free hepatic venous pressure (FHVP) when balloon is deflated and wedged hepatic venous pressure (WHVP) when balloon is inflated (indirect measurement) - Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) = WHVP - FHVP which represents pressure in hepatic sinusoids and portal vein - Portal venous pressure - Normal: HVPG = 1-5 mmHg - Portal hypertension: HVPG ≥ 6 mmHg - **Clinically significant portal hypertension:** HVPG ≥ 10 mmHg - Ascites occurs when HVPG ≥ 10 mmHg - Variceal bleeding occurs when ≥ 12 mmHg
   ➡ Portal hypertension develops when there is resistance to portal blood flow and is aggravated by increased portal collateral blood flow - Pre-hepatic: Portal vein thrombosis - Hepatic: Liver cirrhosis (Infection/ Alcohol-related)/ Autoimmune hepatitis/ PBC/PSC/ Hemochromatosis/ Wilson's disease - Post-hepatic: Hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome)/ IVCO/ Right-sided HF/ Constrictive pericarditis
   ➡ Components of increased resistance in liver cirrhosis - Structural (Architectural) component - Distortion of liver microcirculation by fibrosis, nodules, angiogenesis and vascular occlusion - Dynamic component - Contraction of activated hepatic stellate cells and myofibroblasts surrounding the hepatic sinusoids - ↑ Production of vasoconstrictor (endothelin I) by sinusoidal endothelial cells - ↓ Production of vasodilators (nitric oxide) by sinusoidal endothelial cells
   ➡ Effects of portal hypertension - ↑ Splanchnic blood flow by vasodilation and angiogenesis - Local and systemic production of systemic nitric oxide (NO) - Leads to systemic vasodilatation due to excess NO - Activation of RAAS and ADH release - Development of portosystemic collaterals (shunts) to divert obstructed blood flow into systemic circulation and back to heart which decompresses the portal circulation - Opening and dilatation of preexisting vascular channels - Active angiogenesis with release of VEGF - Portal pressure remains elevated despite formation of collaterals because of increased splanchnic blood flow resulting from splanchnic vasodilation - Collaterals between portal and systemic circulation - Around EGJ: Left gastric veins (portal circulation) collateralizes to esophageal veins (systemic circulation) → Esophageal varices - At rectum and anal canal: Superior hemorrhoidal vein collateralizes to middle and inferior hemorrhoidal veins → Rectal varices - Around umbilicus: Recanalization of umbilical vein collateralizes to abdominal wall veins → Caput medusae

➡Abdominal examination

- Palpation of liver
  - Firm and nodular liver
  - Cirrhotic liver can be large, normal sized or small
    - Post-viral cirrhosis give rise to a small liver (accounts for majority of liver cirrhosis cases since HBV/HCV represents > 90% of cases)
    - Other causes of liver cirrhosis give rise to large liver especially alcoholic cirrhosis and cardiac cirrhosis (but represents minority of cases)
- Palpation of spleen
  - Splenomegaly resulting from portal hypertension

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Anemia
  - Acute and chronic blood loss
  - Anemia of chronic disease
  - Direct toxicity to alcoholism
- Leukopenia
  - Result of hypersplenism
- Thrombocytopenia (common)
  - ↓ Hepatic synthesis of thrombopoietin and impaired platelet production
  - Platelet sequestration in spleen in hypersplenism
    ➡Clotting profile
- ↑ PT/ INR and APTT
  - Isolated prolonged PT in mild liver disease (factor VII has shortest t₁/₂)
  - Prolonged PT and APTT in severe liver disease
  - Deranged clotting profile due to decreased synthetic function of coagulation factors (except factor VIII which is secreted by endothelial cells) is **NOT** the most common since clotting factors are usually produced in excess of need and the liver has tremendous synthetic reserves
  - Deranged clotting profile is usually due to vitamin K deficiency from decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins due to obstructive jaundice (intrahepatic cholestasis) which reduces bile secretion by hepatocytes and bile excretion into intrahepatic bile ducts
    ➡ Iron profile
- ↑ Iron/Ferritin (released from hepatocytes)/ Transferrin (TIBC)
  ➡ Serum protein level
- Reversed A/G ratio (↑ G / ↓ A)
  - ↑ Globulin secondary to portosystemic shunting of bacterial antigens in portal venous blood from liver to lymphoid tissue inducing immunoglobulin production
  - Gut antigens entering liver is not well handled due to cirrhosis

444

➡Hepatitis virus serology

- HBV and HCV serology
  ➡ LFT
- ↔/↑ Total bilirubin
  - Normal in well-compensated cirrhosis but rises as disease progresses
- ↑ AST/ALT
  - AST > ALT but not 2x in liver cirrhosis
  - Generally ALT > AST in most liver diseases except in alcoholic liver disease (except fatty liver), liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
- ↑ ALP/GGT
  - ALP is usually elevated but < 2 - 3x ULN unless there is underlying cholestatic liver disease including primary sclerosing cholangitis or primary biliary cirrhosis
  - GGT is usually elevated and higher in alcoholic liver disease due to alcohol-induced hepatic microsomal GGT or alcohol-induced leakage from hepatocytes
- ↓ Albumin level (Hypoalbuminemia)
  - Half-life of albumin = 20 – 25 days
  - Decreased synthetic function of liver with worsening cirrhosis
    ➡ RFT
- ↑ Creatinine
  - Development of hepatorenal syndrome as cirrhosis progresses
- Hyponatremia (Dilutional)
  - Secretion of ADH secretion due to decrease effective arterial blood volume
  - ↑ Reabsorption of water in distal renal tubules
    ➡ Serum AFP level
- Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

445

3. Radiological tests
   => USG abdomen
   - Ultrasonographic findings of cirrhosis
     - Irregular contour
     - Surface nodularity
     - Atrophy of the right lobe
     - Hypertrophy of caudate or left lobe
     - Coarse heterogenous echogenicity (↑ Echogenicity with irregular appearing areas)
     - Small liver in advanced cirrhosis
   - Ultrasonographic findings of portal hypertension
     - Presence of collateral veins
     - ↑ Diameter of portal vein (Portal vein enlargement)
     - ↓ Flow within portal circulation
   - Other features - Ascites - Splenomegaly - Portal vein thrombosis - Secondary to decreased portal flow velocity leading to portal blood stasis which favors thrombosis
     => CT scan
   - **NOT** routinely used as it provides similar information to USG but at the expense of radiation and contrast exposure
   - CT findings
     - Irregular contour
     - Surface nodularity
     - Regenerative or dysplastic nodules
     - Atrophy of the right lobe
     - Hypertrophy of caudate or left lobe
   - CT findings of portal hypertension - Varices - Ascites - Splenomegaly - Portal vein thrombosis
     => MRI scan
   - Evaluate iron overload as a cause of cirrhosis
   - Evaluate portal vein thrombosis as a complication of cirrhosis
     => Fibroscan (Transient elastography)
   - Ultrasound-based elastography technique for evaluation of liver stiffness and is very accurate in diagnosis of liver cirrhosis
   - Performed using transducer-induced vibrations at low frequency and amplitudes in which the transmitted shear waves propagate through the liver parenchyma
   - Pulse-echo USG acquisition is used to follow the propagation of the shear wave and to measure its average speed
     => Liver biopsy
   - **GOLD STANDARD**
   - Histological appearance
     - Diffuse process affecting entire liver
     - Regenerative nodules of hepatocytes
     - Regenerative nodules are separated by fibrous connective tissues

VI. Complication (decompensated cirrhosis)

1. Ascites and edema
   ➡ **MOST** common complication of cirrhosis
   ➡ Refers to accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity
   ➡ Pathophysiology

- Liver cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension
- Splanchnic arterial vasodilation leads to decrease total systemic vascular resistance
- Arterial underfilling leads to decrease effective arterial blood volume
- Stimulation of RAAS and sympathetic nervous system
- ↑ Na+ and H2O retention + **Hypoalbuminemia**
- Ascites and edema formation
  ➡ Diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis
- Diagnostic paracentesis should be the **FIRST** step of management of ascites for in- hospital patients
- Therapeutic paracentesis for tense ascites and symptomatic relief
- Precautions
  - Give IV 6 – 8 g albumin per L tapped if > 5 L/day of fluid is removed
    - Decreases risk for post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction and hyponatremia
  - Exclusion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis before large volume paracentesis
    - Increases risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) for large volume paracentesis
  - Caution in patients with hypotension and raised serum creatinine and monitor vital signs during paracentesis
- Complication of paracentesis
  - Shock and sepsis
  - Bleeding from puncture sites
  - Perforation of caecum
    - Always perform paracentesis in LLQ
    - Sigmoid colon is mobile with its mesentery whereas caecum is fixed
  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) (uremia)
    - Intravascular depletion with large volume paracentesis
    - Excessive paracentesis with inadequate albumin replacement
  - Hepatic encephalopathy
    - Excessive paracentesis with inadequate albumin replacement

➡Conservative management

- Bed rest
- Salt restriction for 0.5 - 2 g/day
- Fluid restriction for 0.8-1 L/day (1–1.5 L/day - houseman handbook)
  - Indicated in patients with dilutional hyponatremia (< 120 - 125 mmol/L)
  - Monitor input and output, body weight and urine Na+
- Diuretics
  - Target weight loss = 1 kg/day (i.e. 1 L of diuresis)
  - Spironolactone is preferred since it is an aldosterone antagonist and liver cirrhosis is associated with hyperaldosteronism
    - Activation of RAAS by portal hypertension
    - Aldosterone is degraded by liver and is impaired in liver cirrhosis
  - Spironolactone + Frusemide is the standard therapy to maintain normokalemia since spironolactone alone regularly causes hyperkalemia particularly in high dose
  - Spironolactone can be starting as monotherapy in patients with profound hypokalemia (common in the setting of severe alcoholic hepatitis)
  - Amiloride can be substituted for spironolactone in patients with tender gynecomastia
- Precautions - Depletion of fluid into 3rd space and depletion of intravascular volume by diuretics can lead to hypotension and thus albumin is required to increase oncotic pressure - All diuretics should be discontinued if there is severe hyponatremia, progressive renal failure, worsening hepatic encephalopathy or incapacitating muscle cramps - Spironolactone should be stopped if there is severe hyperkalemia - Frusemide should be stopped if there is severe hypokalemia
  ➡Other treatment modalities
- Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
- Liver transplantation

   ➡Different types of bacterial peritonitis

- Culture negative neutrocytic ascites (CNNA)
  - Culture negative with PMNs count ≥ 250 cells/mm³
  - No recent antibiotics without other explanation for cell counts
  - Almost certainly an early form of SBP
- Non-neutrocytic bacterascites (NMBA)
  - Culture positive with PMNs count < 250 cells/mm³
  - May resolve without treatment or progress into SBP
- CAPD-peritonitis
  - Associated with peritoneal dialysis
- Secondary peritonitis - Ascitic fluid infection with a surgically treatable intrabdominal source of infection
  ➡ Clinical manifestation (Asymptomatic in 25%)
- Fever
- Abdominal pain
- Diarrhea (gut irritation)
- Hepatic encephalopathy
  ➡Diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
- Requires **ALL** of the following - Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) count ≥ 250 cells/mm³ - +ve Peritoneal fluid culture result - Gram +ve = Staphylococcus sp./ Streptococcus pneumoniae - Gram -ve (more common) = E. coli/ Klebsiella pneumoniae - Secondary causes of peritonitis are excluded
  ➡Medical treatment
- 3rd generation cephalosporin
  - Effective against Gram -ve anaerobes
  - **Duration** = 5 days and can stop treatment when PMN < 250 cells/mm³
  - **Example**: Cefotaxime/ Ceftriaxone
- Indications for antibiotics therapy (any of the following) - Fever > 37.8°C - Abdominal pain or tenderness - Altered mental status - Ascitic fluid PMN count ≥ 250 cells/mm³
  ➡Prevention of recurrence
- Fluoroquinolones
  - Lifelong selective intestinal decontamination (unless patient receive liver transplant with normalization of liver function)
    - Incomplete absorption by gut leading to high concentration
    - High activity against Gram -ve bacilli
    - Low bacterial resistance
    - Less side effects
  - **Example**: Levofloxacin/ Norfloxacin

3. Portal hypertensive gastropathy
   => Pathogenesis

- Portal hypertension causes mucosal vascular ectasia
- Mucosa is friable and thus bleeding occurs when ectatic vessels rupture
- Differential diagnosis of bleeding in cirrhotic patients
  - Variceal bleeding (esophageal and gastric)
  - Portal hypertensive gastropathy
  - Generalized bleeding tendency
    - Pancytopenia due to hypersplenism
    - ↓ Production of coagulation factor
  - Peptic ulcer disease (PUD)
  - Mallory Weiss syndrome
    => Clinical manifestation
- Overt or occult GI bleeding
  - More commonly occult GI bleeding with anemia
    => Treatment
- Non-selective ẞ-blockers (NSBB)
  - ↓ Grading of gastropathy and risk of rebleeding
  - **Example:** Propranolol

451

4. Variceal hemorrhage
   ➡General features

- Esophageal or gastric varices presents with hematemesis and melena
  - Anatomical extent of hematemesis = Up to ligament of Treitz (DJ junction)
  - Anatomical extent of melena = From nasopharynx to proximal colon
- Endoscopy required for diagnosis of source of bleeding - OGD should be arranged as soon as possible after admission once hemodynamic condition is stabilized (SBP > 70 mmHg)
  ➡Pathophysiology
- Varices are portosystemic (collateral) shunts which are formed due to opening and dilatation of preexisting vascular channels by portal hypertension
  - Varices decompress the portal circulation by returning blood to heart via systemic venous circulation
  - Most commonly found in the distal esophagus and proximal stomach around GEJ leading to gastroesophageal varices
  - Gastroesophageal varices occur when the left gastric (coronary) veins (portal circulation) collateralizes to esophageal veins (systemic circulation)
  - Other locations of varices include rectum and umbilicus
- Hepatic-venous pressure gradient (HVPG) refers to the pressure gradient between portal vein and IVC which quantify the degree of portal hypertension
  - Risk of development of varices: HVPG ≥ 12 mmHg
  - Unlikely to bleeding if pressure < 12 mmHg
- Variceal bleeding occurs in large vessels with thin walls - Laplace's law states tension is proportional to radius (T~ r) - Larger the varices the more likely it will bleed
  ➡Clinical manifestation
- Hematemesis
- Melena
- Shock
- ± Coma (due to hepatic encephalopathy)
  ➡Endoscopic grading
- Size of varices
  - F1 = Small straight varices
    - Full compression with air insufflation
  - F2 = Enlarged tortuous varices that occupy < 1/3 of lumen
    - Failure of compression with air insufflation
  - F3 = Large coil-shaped varices that occupy > 1/3 of lumen
    - Failure of compression with air insufflation
- Appearance of varices
  - Red wale marks\* = Longitudinal red streaks on varices that resemble red corduroy wales → Associated with increased risk of bleeding
  - Cherry red spots = Discrete red cherry-colored spots that overlie varices

452

➡Initial management

- Fluid replacement for treatment of shock
  - 2D1S Q6-8H
  - Maintain systolic BP at 90 - 100 mmHg
  - **AVOID** excessive volume restitution to prevent increasing portal pressure and thus leads to sustain active bleeding or early rebleeding
- Restrictive blood transfusion
  - Cross match packed RBC (takes ~ 1.5 hrs in QMH) but unmatched (O-negative) blood can be used in emergency situation
    - O-positive blood given to females carries the risk of Rhesus sensitization and subsequent hemolytic disease of newborn
    - O-positive blood can still be given but with Anti-Rh antibodies
  - Threshold of blood transfusion
    - Hb = 7 g/dL but rate of Hb drop is more important
  - Aims at Hb = 8 g/dL and hematocrit = 21 - 24%
    - Excessive replacement of blood products or administration of NS can lead to both rebleeding and increased mortality
- Correction of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy
  - FFP and platelet infusion
  - IV Vitamin K1 (10 mg daily for 3 days) should be given routinely to cirrhotic patients even knowing that it is probably **USELESS**
    - Vitamin K is only useful to normalize PT in cholestasis (leading to vitamin K deficiency) and warfarin overdose
    - **NOT** useful in parenchymal disease like liver cirrhosis but we still give Vitamin K1 routinely since there may or may not be a cholestatic element
- NPO except for medication
- Do **NOT** insert NG tube since it will worsen variceal bleeding
- Endotracheal (ET) intubation if coma
  - Protect the airway, prevent aspiration and facilitate the safe performance of endoscopy and other procedures in nearly always indicated
- Close monitoring of vitals including BP/P Q1H
  453

Medical treatment

- Terlipressin ± Nitroglycerin
  - 1st line treatment which is the preferred agent
    - Pharmacological category = Synthetic analogue of vasopressin
      - Acts as a splanchnic vasoconstrictor to decrease portal blood flow and thus portal pressure
    - Dosage = IV 2 mg Q4H and titrate down to IV 1 mg Q4H after bleeding is controlled
      - Longer action (3 – 4 hours) that is released in slow and sustained manner
      - Allowing its administration via intermittent injections (bolus)
  - Reduce bleeding and initial hemostasis failure + **Reduces all-cause mortality**
  - Aware of side effects related to vasoconstriction such as bowel ischemia, MI, peripheral vascular ischemia and hypertension
    - More systemic effects (e.g. bowel ischemia, MI) than octreotide and somatostatin
    - Nitroglycerin can further decrease portal venous pressure while counteracting the systemic hemodynamic side effects of terlipressin
- Octreotide/ Somatostatin
  - Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue which inhibits the release of vasodilator hormones such as glucagon indirectly causing splanchnic vasoconstriction and decreased portal inflow
  - Reduce bleeding and initial hemostasis failure
  - Octreotide has the advantage that it can be administered for 5 days or longer and is the preferred agent in the United States
  - Aware of side effects related to vasoconstriction such as bowel ischemia, MI, peripheral vascular ischemia and hypertension
    - Less systemic effects (e.g. bowel ischemia, MI) than terlipressin
- Remarks
  - Although vasopressin is theoretically the most potent vasoconstrictor, its use is limited by its systemic vasoconstrictive effects such as hypertension, MI, arrhythmia, bowel ischemia and limb gangrene
  - Vasoactive agents are initiated before endoscopy to patient with suspected variceal bleeding and maintained for 2 – 5 days after endoscopic treatment
  - Combined drug (~2.5 hour before) and endoscopic treatment shows superiority to endoscopic therapy alone

➡General features

- Patient should be intubated to prevent aspiration
- Indicated when active bleeding is seen during OGD and bleeding cannot be controlled by endoscopic means
- Temporary stabilization only and acts as a bridge until definite therapy including endoscopic banding or TIPS can be instituted
  - Established diagnosis of esophageal varices is required by OGD
  - Complications and rebleeding occurs upon balloon deflation and thus **NOT** a definitive treatment
- Should be placed at maximum for 24 hours and should be temporary deflated 12 hours to prevent pressure necrosis

➡Different types of balloon

- Linton-Nachlas tube (2 ports)
- Sengstaken Blakemore tube (3 ports)
- Minnesota tube (4 ports)
  - Additional esophageal opening for removing saliva and decrease the risk of aspiration

➡ Components of balloon

- Gastric balloon + Gastric suction port (L-N tube)
- - Esophageal balloon (S-B tube)
- - Esophageal suction port (M tube)

➡ Procedures

- Patient is positioned in supine or left lateral position
- Tube is inserted through mouth or nostril (HK practice) until at least 50 cm of the tube is introduced
  - Blind insertion into esophagus is easier with access through nose
- Confirm the tube is inside the stomach
  - Injection of contrast and check via CXR
  - Aspirate fluid to test the content with pH
  - Air is injected into the gastric suction port (**NOT** balloon port) while auscultation is performed over the stomach
- Gastric balloon is inflated with water added with methylene blue
  - Target volume = **200 – 250 mL**
  - Methylene blue is added so that if the gastric balloon rupture the dye will be visible in gastric aspirate
- Tube is pulled until resistance is felt at which point the balloon is tamponading the gastroesophageal (OG) junction - Tube is then securely fastened to either a pulley device to maintain tension on the tube and thus continued tamponade at the OG junction - 1-2 lb weight (a 500 mL IV fluid bag) can be used to maintain tension on the tube - Often sufficient to stop variceal hemorrhage already rendering inflation of esophageal balloon unnecessary
  [Image of the number 456 at the bottom right of the page.]

- Esophageal balloon is inflated with air if bleeding continues at a pressure of 30–45 mmHg higher than the pressure of portal hypertension
  - Target pressure = **25 mmHg** once bleeding is controlled
  - Do **NOT** overinflate the balloon to prevent esophageal pressure necrosis or rupture
  - Hepatic-venous pressure gradient (HVPG) refers to the pressure gradient between portal vein and IVC which quantify the degree of portal hypertension
    - Normal: HVPG = 1–5 mmHg
    - Portal hypertension: HVPG ≥ 6 mmHg
    - Risk of development of varices: HVPG ≥ 12 mmHg
- Deflation of gastric and esophageal balloon every 12 hours to check for rebleeding
- Complications
  - Pressure necrosis
    - Prolonged use or overinflation of balloon
  - Aspiration pneumonia
    - Aspiration of saliva since it cannot reach the stomach
    - ONLY in S-B tube but not Minnesota tube
  - Incorrect position of gastric balloon
    - Esophageal perforation if placed at esophagus
    - Asphyxia if slipped out of esophagus to pharynx (height between weight and ground should be set at around 15 cm which is less than the length of esophagus (25 cm) to prevent asphyxia in case the tube migrates)

➡ General features

- Shunting created by radiology
- Creation of a low-resistance channel between hepatic vein and portal vein and kept patent with expandable metal stent
  - Allow portal blood to bypass the flow-resisting liver and return to systemic circulation which decreases portal hypertension
- Indicated in variceal bleeding, refractory ascites, refractory hepatic hydrothorax and Budd-Chiari syndrome
- Contraindicated in patient with DIC, thrombosis of left and right IJV, SVC, IVC, liver abscess, HCC and liver failure

➡ Procedures

- Transjugular access through IJV → SVC → IVC → Middle hepatic vein → Right branch of portal vein
  - Right portal vein is anatomically more straight and easier to pass through during transjugular access
- Puncture and catheterization of and implantation of stent joining hepatic and portal vein branch

➡ Complications

- Acute complications
  - Sepsis/Intraabdominal bleed from perforation/ DIC/ Thromboembolism with clot in stent/ Volume overload with right heart failure/ Renal failure (related to dye)
- Chronic complications
  - Hepatic encephalopathy/ Recurrent bleeding (inadequate portal decompression)/ Stent stenosis (stent cannot be retrieved and increases risk of complication)

[Anatomical drawing showing the liver and the surrounding blood vessels. There is a guidewire snaking through the veins around the liver. A second smaller diagram shows a stent being deployed in the vein.]

458

**Surgical shunting**

➡General features

- Shunting created by surgery
- Need for surgical shunting has been reduced since the introduction of TIPS and liver transplantation
- Indicated only in patients with MELD score < 15, who are not candidates for liver transplantation or have limited access to TIPS therapy

➡Porto-caval shunt

- Involves joining the portal vein to the IVC
  - End-to-side fashion which completely disrupts portal venous flow to the liver
  - Side-to-side fashion which maintains partial portal venous flow to the liver
- Almost **NEVER** performed nowadays due to the high incidence of
  - Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) since nitrogenous products are diverted away and not filtered by the liver
  - Liver atrophy due to reduction of portal perfusion

➡Mesenterico-caval (mesocaval) shunt

- Involves jointing of superior mesenteric vein (SMV) to the IVC
- Technically easier to perform and can be easily ligated during subsequent liver transplantation
- Small diameter of the portosystemic shunt reduces the incidence of HE and avoids liver atrophy due to decreased portal blood flow but at the expense of increased risks of shunt thrombosis and rebleeding

➡Spleno-renal shunt

- **MOST** often used surgical shunt nowadays
- Involves division of gastroesophageal collaterals and allow venous drainage of stomach and lower esophagus through short gastrosplenic veins into the spleen which ultimately decompresses by allows the splenic vein to drain directly into the left renal vein and into IVC
- Technically most difficult to perform but has the advantage of being associated with a lower rate of HE and not interfering with subsequent liver transplantation

459

➡ Prevention of hepatic encephalopathy

- Lactulose and titrate until 2 - 4 soft stools/day
- Correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance
- Rationale
  - Blood is high in protein content
  - Cirrhotic liver will be deprived of blood supply when there is ongoing bleeding
    ➡ Prevention of sepsis
- Prophylactic antibiotic for 7 days
- Infection is a strong prognostic indicator in acute variceal hemorrhage and use of antibiotics have been shown to reduce risk of rebleeding and mortality
- Ciprofloxacin/ Ceftriaxone/ Ertapenem
  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with preserved liver function
  - Ceftriaxone in patients with advanced cirrhosis or fluoroquinolone-resistance
  - Ertapenem in patients with ESBL-Enterobacteriaceae infection
- Rationale
  - Infection is a strong prognostic indicator in acute bleeding and use of antibiotics reduce risk of SBP, rebleeding and mortality
    ➡ Prevention of rebleeding
- Endoscopic variceal band ligation (EVL) + Non-selective ẞ-blockers (NSBB)
  - EVL is superior to NSBB in primary prevention (i.e. prevent 1st bleed) in reducing the risk of bleeding but no difference in mortality
    - ALL patients with liver cirrhosis should be screened endoscopically for varices at the time of diagnosis
  - Combination of EVL and NSBB is considered best option for secondary prevention (i.e. after 1st bleed) of variceal hemorrhage
  - EVL should be repeated Q1 – 2 weeks until complete obliteration with FU OGD at 3 months and then every 6 – 12 months to monitor for recurrence
  - NSBB decreases CO and blocks the adrenergic dilatory tone in mesenteric arterioles resulting in unopposed a-adrenergic mediated vasoconstriction and thus a decrease in portal venous inflow
    - Example: Propranolol/ Nadolol/ Carvedilol
- Isosorbide 5-mononitrate + Non-selective ẞ-blockers (NSBB)
  - Addition of isosorbide-5-mononitrate (vasodilator) to NSBB improves efficiency of treatment in hemodynamic non-responders
  - BUT isosorbide mononitrate (alone or in addition to endoscopic therapy) does not appear to reduce bleeding or mortality in patients with esophageal varices
- Long-term prevention
  - Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
  - Liver transplantation

5. Hepatic encephalopathy
   ➡Potentially reversible neuropsychiatric abnormalities seen in patients with liver dysfunction or
   portosystemic shunting
   ➡Grading of hepatic encephalopathy

- Grade I = Disordered sleep + Attention deficit + Slurred speech
- Grade II = Lethargy + Asterixis
- Grade III = Stupor/ Somnolence + Incoherent speech
- Grade IV = Coma

[Diagram showing the conversion of Glutamate + NH3 to Glutamine using the enzyme Glutamine synthetase and the reverse reaction using the enzyme Glutaminase.]

[Diagram showing the Urea cycle: Urea + H2O converting into NH3 + CO2 using the enzyme Urease.]

➡Normal physiology

- Normal production of ammonia (NH3)
  - Colonic bacterial catabolism of nitrogenous sources such as ingested protein
  - Urease-producing bacteria which converts urea into ammonia (NH3)
- Normal clearance of ammonia (NH3)
  - Intact liver normally clear almost all portal vein ammonia (NH3) by
    - Converting it into urea through the urea cycle and secrete in urine
    - Converting it into glutamine by glutamine synthetase and preventing entry into systemic circulation

➡Pathogenesis of HE

- ↑ Ammonia (NH3) level in blood
  - Hepatic ammonia detoxification into urea due to impaired liver function
  - Portosystemic shunting in which blood from GIT bypass the liver and flow directly into systemic circulation
- Ammonia crosses BBB and enters the brain tissues
  - ↑ Intracellular osmolarity in astrocytes (resulting from metabolism of ammonia in astrocytes into glutamine) leading to astrocyte swelling and damage and subsequently cerebral edema
- Ammonia-induced oxidative stress also promotes astrocytes swelling
  - Neurotoxic effect on brain tissues leads to neuroinflammation and altered neurotransmission affecting conscious and behavior

➡Clinical manifestation

- Cognitive impairments
  - Impaired attention, reaction time and working memory
  - Hepatic coma
- Neuromuscular impairments
  - Bradykinesia
  - Hyperreflexia
  - Rigidity
  - Myoclonus
  - Flapping tremor (Asterixis)
  - Decerebrate posturing
- Sleep disturbances
  - Insomnia
  - Hypersomnia

462

➡ Diagnosis

- **Arterial** ammonia level
  - Elevated ammonia level is **NOT** required to make a diagnosis of HE
  - Elevated ammonia levels can also be seen in other conditions such as shock, GI bleeding or renal diseases
- Psychometric tests
  - Detection of minimal hepatic encephalopathy
  - **Example:** Reitan's test (Number connection test)/ Inhibitory control test (ICT)
- Electrophysiologic tests
  - Detection of minimal hepatic encephalopathy
  - **Example:** EEG monitoring/ Evoked potential/ Critical flicker frequency

➡General management

- Antibiotics in suspected sepsis
- Correct electrolyte imbalance
  - Hyponatremia/ Hypokalemia/ Metabolic acidosis and alkalosis/ Azotemia
- Avoidance of sedatives, alcohol, diuretics, hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic drugs
- Tracheal intubation should be considered in patient with deep encephalopathy
- **NO** restriction in dietary protein intake but vegetable and dairy sources are preferred over animal sources
  - Unless HE is precipitated by very high protein diet
- Calorie intake
  - Oral intake should be withheld 24 – 48 hours and enteral intake via gastric tube can be started if patients are unable to eat afterwards
  - IV 10% Dextrose drip should be provided to decrease protein intake and breakdown
  - Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in oral or IV form can be supplemented (based on an increase in ratio of aromatic amino acid: branched chain amino acids (AAA: BCAA) ratio contributes to HE)

➡Medical treatment

- Lactulose (osmotic laxatives)
  - **Target bowel movements** = Titrate until 2 – 4 soft stools/day to prevent dehydration
  - Lactulose is degraded by lactobacilli into lactic acid which lower the colonic pH and creates an acid medium
  - Inhibits urease-producing bacteria and displace it with non-urease-producing Lactobacillus
  - Acid medium draws NH3 from mucosal blood into gut and traps luminal ammonia (NH3) converting it into ammonium (NH4+)
- Rifaximin
  - Dosage = 550 mg BID
  - Oral antibiotics that causes alteration of colonic flora especially urease-producing bacteria such as E. coli (↓ Gut bacteria leading to ↓ NH3 production)
  - Synergistic effect with lactulose and is more effective than lactulose alone and thus is generally added rather than substituted for lactulose
- L-Ornithine-L-aspartate
  - Stimulates metabolism of ammonia (NH3) into glutamine
- Referral for liver transplantation in recurrent intractable overt hepatic encephalopathy

6. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)
   ➡Functional renal impairment in patients with advanced liver disease and without evidence of renal parenchymal disease, severe volume loss or nephrotoxicity from medication

- Type 1 HRS
  - Rapid decline in renal function
    - Defined as ≥ 2x increase in serum creatinine (reflecting a 50% reduction in creatinine clearance) to a level of 2.5 mg/dL (221 µmol/L) within 2 weeks
    - Triggered by precipitating events such as infections including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, GI bleeding or over-diuresis
- Type 2 HRS
  - Steady progressive decline in renal function
  - Usually characterized by refractory ascites resistant to diuretics and Na+ retention
    ➡Pathophysiology
- Liver cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension
- Splanchnic arterial vasodilation leads to decrease total systemic vascular resistance
- Arterial underfilling leads to decrease effective arterial blood volume (↓ MAP)
- Stimulation of RAAS and sympathetic nervous system
- Leads to renal vasoconstriction and decreased renal perfusion
  - Angiotensin II leads to vasoconstriction of afferent and efferent arterioles (with efferent > afferent)
    ➡Clinical presentation
- Oliguria
- Progressive rise in plasma creatinine concentration
- Low rate of Na+ excretion (i.e. urine Na+ < 10 mEq/L)
- Normal urine sediment
- No or minimal proteinuria
  ➡Diagnostic criteria
- Acute kidney injury (AKI)
  - Increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 µmol/L) within 48 hours (OR)
  - Increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5x from baseline which is known or presumed to have occurred within the prior 7 days (OR)
  - Urine volume < 0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6 hours
- Liver cirrhosis with ascites
- Absence of improvement in serum creatinine (decrease to ≤ 1.5 mg/dL) after ≥ 2 days of diuretic withdrawal and plasma volume expansion with albumin
- Absence of parenchymal renal disease
  - Proteinuria < 0.5 g/day
  - No microscopic hematuria
  - Normal renal ultrasound
- Absence of shock
- Absence of current or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs

464

➡Management (Critically ill patients)

- Norepinephrine/ Vasopressin + Albumin - Target at increasing MAP by 10 mmHg
  ➡Management (Non-critically ill patients)
- Terlipressin + Albumin
  - Vasopressin analogues to reduce splanchnic vasodilatation
  - Albumin to expand the effective arterial blood volume and reduce the release of vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II and norepinephrine
- Octreotide + Midodrine + Albumin - Octreotide = Somatostatin analog which inhibits endogenous vasodilator release and thus produces splanchnic vasoconstriction - Midodrine = Selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist which acts as systemic vasoconstrictors - Albumin to expand the effective arterial blood volume and reduce the release of vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II and norepinephrine
  ➡Other treatment modalities
- Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
- Dialysis
- Liver transplantation

465

7. Hepatic hydrothorax
   ➡Defined as presence of pleural effusion in patient with cirrhosis and no evidence of underlying
   cardiopulmonary diseases
   ➡Result from movement of ascitic fluid into pleural space through defects in diaphragm

- Often unilateral with R > L-sided pleural effusion
  ➡Management (same as ascites)
- Na+ and fluid restriction
- Diuretics
- Therapeutic thoracentesis
- Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
  ➡Precautions
- Chest drain must NOT be placed to prevent massive protein and electrolyte depletion,
  infection, renal failure and bleeding

8. Hepatopulmonary syndrome
   ➡Presents as a classical triad

- Abnormal arterial oxygenation (impaired gas exchange) caused by intrapulmonary
  vascular dilatation (IPVD) in the setting of liver disease, portal hypertension or
  congenital portosystemic shunts - Increased alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient while breathing room air
  ➡Clinical manifestation
- Dyspnea (most common)
- Platypnea - Increase in dyspnea that is induced by moving into an upright position and
  relieved by recumbency
- Orthodeoxia - Decrease in arterial oxygen tension > 4 mmHg (OR) arterial oxyhemoglobin
  desaturation > 5% when moving into upright position and relieved by recumbency
  ➡Diagnosis
- Transthoracic contrast echocardiography (TTCE) - Normally contrast only opacifies the right heart chambers because it is filtered by
  the pulmonary capillary bed - Contrast opacifies the left heart chambers when there is a right-to-left
  intrapulmonary shunt - Appearance of contrast in the left heart after 3-8 cycles of heartbeat after the RA
  is suggestive of intrapulmonary shunt due to intrapulmonary vascular dilatation
  ➡Treatment
- Long-term O2 supplementation
- Embolization of large intrapulmonary vascular dilatations (IPVD)
- Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
- Liver transplantation

466

9. Portopulmonary hypertension
   ➡Refers pulmonary hypertension (PAH) in patients who has existing portal hypertension

- Defined by right heart catheterization with - Mean pulmonary artery pressure > 25 mmHg - Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure < 15 mmHg
  ➡Pathogenesis
- Endothelin-1 which is normally metabolized by liver is now able to reach the pulmonary circulation due to portosystemic collaterals
- Leads to pulmonary vasoconstriction and thus PAH
  ➡Clinical manifestation
- Dyspnea
- Chest pain
- Syncope
- Fatigue
  ➡ Treatment
- Prostacyclin pathway agonists
- Endothelin receptor antagonists
- PDE5 inhibitors
- Liver transplantation

10. Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy
    ➡ Characterized by normal to increased cardiac output and contractility at rest but blunted response to pharmacological, physiological or pathological stress - ↓ Chronotropic and inotropic response - ↓ Systolic and diastolic function
    ➡Can be attributable to the underlying cause of cirrhosis

- Alcoholism or hemochromatosis

VII. Prognosis

1. Child-Pugh classification
   ➡Assessment of severity of cirrhosis (ABCDE mnemonics)

- Class A (Well-compensated disease): Score = 5-6
  o 1-year survival rate = 100%
  o 2-year survival rate = 85%
- Class B (Significant functional compromise): Score = 7-9
  o 1-year survival rate = 80%
  o 2-year survival rate = 60%
- Class C (Decompensated disease): Score = 10-15
  o 1-year survival rate = 45%
  o 2-year survival rate = 35%

[Table with 5 rows and 4 columns. The first row is the header row, and the remaining rows contain data about parameters, and associated points, used to classify cirrhosis severity.
The columns are: "Parameter", "1", "2", and "3".

The data in the table is as follows:

| Parameter            | 1                | 2                    | 3               |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | --- |
| Ascites              | Absent           | Slight               | Moderate        |
| Encephalopathy       | None             | Grade 1-2            | Grade 3-4       |
| Bilirubin            | < 2 mg/dL        | 2-3 mg/dL            | > 3 mg/dL       |
|                      | (< 34.2 mmol/L)  | (34.2 – 51.3 mmol/L) | (> 51.3 mmol/L) |
| Albumin              | > 3.5 g/dL       | 2.8-3.5 g/L          | < 2.8 g/dL      |
|                      | (35 g/L)         | (28-35 g/L)          | (< 28 g/L)      |
|                      | Prothrombin time |                      |                 |
| Seconds over control | < 4              | 4-6                  | > 6             |
| INR                  | < 1.7            | 1.7-2.3              | > 2.3           | ]   |

Remarks: A = Albumin; B = Bilirubin; C = Coagulopathy; D = Drain the ascites; E = Encephalopathy

2. MELD (Model for End Stage Liver Disease) score
   ➡ MELD score components = Creatinine + Bilirubin + INR

- Serum creatinine is included initially due to consideration of hepatorenal syndrome
- Serum Nat is incorporated into MELD score calculation in 2016 (MELDNa) to reflect the vasodilatory state in cirrhosis and the extent of fluid retention causing dilutional hyponatremia which increases mortality
  ➡ Assign probability of pre-transplant death corresponding to degree of medical urgency
  Originally designed to predict 3-month survival in patients with liver cirrhosis
  ➡ Give priority to patient with the highest MELD score (Transplant benefit when score > 18)
  ➡ Status change
- Priority status will change from time to time since new patients are added
- No guarantee that next graft will be allocated to patient because allocation is based on priority status on that time

| MELD                                                                                                          | PELD                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _ Serum Total Bilirubin _ Serum Creatinine _ International Normalized Ratio (INR) _ Etiology of Liver Disease | _ Similar to MELD but uses slightly different criteria to recognize the specific growth and developmental needs of children _ Paediatric patients are patients under the age of 18 |

MELD Score = [0.957 x Log(creatinine mg/dL) + 0.378 x Log(bilirubin mg/dL) +1.120 x Log(INR) + 0.643] x10
PELD Score =(0.436 [Age (<1 YR.)] -0.678 x Log, (albumin g/dL) + 0.480 x Log(total bilirubin mg/dL) + 1.857 x Log(INR) +0.667) x10

| MELD/PELD score | Observed condition                                                                    | Mortality within three months |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 10              | \* can lead normal life                                                               | 5%                            |
| 20              | _ normally unable to work _ requires frequent medical follow-up and abdominal tapping | 10 - 30%                      |
| 30              | _ normally unable to work _ requires frequent medical follow-up and abdominal tapping | 40 - 50%                      |
| 40              | _ loss of consciousness _ requires intubation and intensive care                      | 80 - 100%                     |

3. Comparison between Childs-Pugh score VS MELD score
   ➡MELD score is better in general

- NO subjective measurements involved such as degree of ascites or encephalopathy
- Continuous scale for calculation rather than assigning scores to a range of parameters

VIII. Case study
Case 1
A 50-year-old postman presented with gradual abdominal distension for 2 months. He first knew he had
chronic hepatitis B when he tried to donate blood 30 years ago. 20 years ago he was admitted to hospital
because of severe anorexia, nausea, darkened urine and jaundice lasting for about 4 weeks. He was treated
with IV fluid diagnosed to have an acute exacerbation of his chronic hepatitis. Since then he remained well
till 2 months ago when he noted gradual onset of abdominal and ankle swelling especially prominent in the
evenings. His appetite remained good. His mother was known to carry the hepatitis B virus, 2 of his 4
siblings also had chronic hepatitis B and his maternal uncle died of liver cancer at the age of 55 years old.
The patient was an occasional beer drinker mainly at weekends. He had multiple sexual partners 30 years
ago.
Physical examination shows he had at least 3 spiders in his upper chest, palmer erythema and early finger
clubbing (loss of angle between nail and nail bed together with floating sensation) but he was not jaundiced.
He had ankle edema up to his knees as well as bilateral shin pigmentation. He had a distended abdomen with
a flattened umbilicus. The liver was not palpable and liver dullness was actually decreased to about a 5 cm
span at the right MCL. The spleen was enlarged to 5 cm below the costal margin, firm and non-tender.
Shifting dullness was evident but there was no fluid thrill.
Q1: What is the diagnosis and on what is it based?
➡ Post-hepatitis cirrhosis of liver

- History of chronic hepatitis B
- Stigmata of chronic liver disease
- Shrunken liver
- Splenomegaly
- Ascites
  ➡ Ascites
- Secondary to cirrhosis of liver due to chronic hepatitis B infection
  Q2: How did the patent acquire the hepatitis B infection?
  ➡ From his mother at birth or through close post-natal contact
- Maternal uncle's death due to HCC further confirms that his mother's family had the infection
- Typically not all siblings are infected and theoretically the younger children are less likely to be infected - Mother might have undergone HBeAg seroconversion resulting in a lower viral load as she grows older
  ➡ Sexual transmission due to multiple sexual partners
- Infection in adulthood is unlikely to give rise to chronic infection
  Q3: What evidence is there that his abdominal distension is not due to obesity and why are cirrhotic
  patients more prone to develop ascites at an early stage of disease?
  ➡ Concomitant ankle swelling is indicative of fluid retention in patient
- Making ascites a likely cause of his simultaneous abdominal swelling
  ➡ Cirrhotic patients are prone to develop ascites early due to portal HT
- Portal HY will localize retained fluid in the peritoneum
  470

Q4: Is occasional beer drinking dangerous in this patient?
No, it is not considered dangerous if occasional

- Alcohol and hepatitis B have synergistic effects on liver damage
- Small amount of alcohol appears acceptable in hepatitis B patient
- Small amount of alcohol is very dangerous in hepatitis C patient
  Q5: What are the relevant investigations for this patient?
  Complete blood count (CBC)
- Degree of hypersplenism
- Possible blood loss through varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy
  Hepatitic B serology
- HBsAg
  - Should be tested annually since there is a 0.1 – 1.0% annual rate of spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance
- HBeAg/ Anti-HBe
  - +ve Anti-HBe including majority of cirrhosis complications including hepatoma
- HBV DNA
  - Needs checking to determine whether the patient requires treatment
    Liver function test (LFT)
- Normal bilirubin level
  - Usually normal until a relatively late stage of cirrhosis
- ↑AST and ALT level
  - Do NOT reflect severity of cirrhosis
- ↑ ALP and GGT level
  - Raised only in space-occupying diseases of the liver or cholestasis
  - Normal or marginally raised in parenchymal liver disease
- ↓ Serum albumin level
  - Indicates subacute and chronic liver disease
- ↑ Serum globulin level
  - Increased antigenic stimulation of B cells in liver cirrhosis
  - Gut antigens are shunted directly to the systemic circulation through porto- systemic shunts and the failing liver is not able to eliminate such antigens
  - Production of abnormal antigens by cirrhotic liver
- ↑ AFP
  - Should be routinely measured to screen for early hepatoma
  - Raised if there is liver regeneration after an acute exacerbation
- ↑ Prothrombin time (PT)
  - Indication of clinically significant liver dysfunction
    Renal function test
- Obtain baseline before diuretic therapy
  Paracentesis of ascites fluid
- WBC and differentials to exclude spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
- ↓ Protein level
  - Characteristically low in liver cirrhosis
  - < 10 g/L in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis indicative of low opsonic activity
    USG liver and spleen
- Performed every 6 months to detect early small hepatoma < 3 cm in diameter
- Support diagnosis of cirrhosis if the liver is small
- Suspect cirrhosis if spleen is large or there is ascites

Q6: How would you treat this patient?
➡Treatment of hepatitis B viral infection

- Indicated if viral load is high and ALT is > 1.5 - 2x times upper limit of normal
- Nucleoside analogues (e.g. Lamivudine/ Adefovir/ Entecavir)
  - Lamivudine can reduce development of cirrhosis complications including hepatoma and is almost without side effects but with progressive drug resistance (> 65% after 4 years of therapy)
  - Adefovir has a relatively low drug resistance (6% in 3 years)
  - Entecavir is also effective against lamivudine-resistant virus
- Interferon is contraindicated in liver cirrhosis
  - Interferon can cause further liver decompensation in patients with borderline liver function
    ➡Treatment of ascites
- K+-sparing diuretics (e.g. spironolactone/ amiloride)
  - Effective for fluid control because in liver cirrhosis hyperaldosteronism is severe as aldosterone is normally metabolized by the liver
  - Frequent side effect is painful gynecomastia in male patients for spironolactone and hence amiloride is used as 1st line agent in males
- Loop diuretics
  - Bumetanide is more reliably absorbed from gut than frusemide when there is portal HT
- Paracentesis
  - Can be used as the first treatment for in-patient
  - Relatively safe and free of side effects
  - Adequate albumin should be infused to maintain intravascular volume
  - Possible complications include renal impairment (which can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy), infection and intraperitoneal bleeding (prevented by FFP/ platelet)
- Dietary modification
  - Low salt diet
  - Restriction of fluid intake (~1 L per day)

# Gastrointestinal Disease

# Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

I. Overview

1.  General features
    ➡ Insidious onset with rapidly progressing course which is fatal

- Median survival with HCC = 2-4 months
  ➡ Hematogenous spread
- Intrahepatic metastasis
- Spread through [portal vein branches](portal vein branches)
- Bone/ Lung/ Lymph node (porta hepatis) metastasis
- Spread through [hepatic vein branches](hepatic vein branches) and spread to IVC, right heart and lungs
- Spread to bones and lymph nodes (porta hepatis) in liver hilum
- Usually death precedes extensive metastasis
- Other sites of metastasis
- Intra-abdominal LN/ Adrenals/ Peritoneum

II. Epidemiology

1.  General epidemiology
    ➡ Males are more frequently affected than females

- M : F ratio = 6 : 1
  ➡ Peak age of mortality = 45-55 years old in HK

2.  Global epidemiology
    ➡ High incidence areas

- China (Hong Kong) (55%)/ Southeast Asia/ Africa
  ➡ Low incidence areas
- UK/ America/ Australia

3.  Hong Kong's epidemiology
    ➡ Exceedingly common in HK

- 3rd common cause of cancer death in HK (2012)
- HCC is 6x more common than cholangiocarcinoma (CC) (HCC: CC = 6 : 1)
  ➡ Constitutes the majority of primary malignant tumours of the liver
- HCC (78.7%)
- CC (9.7%)

473

### III. Etiology

1. Risk factor
   ➡ Chronic hepatitis B and C (HBV and HCV) - HCC that complicates HCV usually presents on top of a cirrhotic liver (100%) - HCC that complicates HBV can present on top of a non-cirrhotic liver (20%) since HBV has direct oncogenic effect - HBV-encoded X antigen (HBxAg)/ Pre-S1/ Pre-S2 is responsible for carcinogenesis - **Risk of cirrhosis** = 20 – 30% of adults who are chronically infected will develop liver cirrhosis at least 10 – 15 years - **Risk of HCC** = 20 – 30% of adults who are chronically infected will develop liver cirrhosis in 55 – 60 years
   ➡ Liver cirrhosis - Occurs in 70 – 90% of cases - HCC as one of the late complications in advanced cirrhosis
   ➡ Alcoholic liver disease - HCC develops on top on alcoholic cirrhosis (100%)
   ➡ Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease - Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) - Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
   ➡ Autoimmune liver diseases - Autoimmune hepatitis - Primary biliary cholangitis (cirrhosis) (PBC) - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
   ➡ Genetics - Wilson's disease - Hemochromatosis (Iron overload) - α1-antitrypsin deficiency
   ➡ Aflatoxin - Mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus flavus which contaminates corn, soybeans and peanuts - Leads to mutation of p53 tumour suppressor gene - Risk factors in Africa and rural areas but **NOT** HK
   ➡ Obesity
   ➡ Diabetes mellitus (DM)
   ➡ Smoking
   ➡ Alcoholism - High but **NOT** moderate level of alcohol consumption - Direct toxic effect or indirect effect by inducing liver cirrhosis

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Benign primary liver tumours

- Hepatic hemangioma
- Hepatic adenoma
- Focal nodular hyperplasia
  ➡ Malignant primary liver tumours
- Hepatocellular carcinoma
- Cholangiocarcinoma
- Fibrolamellar carcinoma
- Hemangioendothelioma
  ➡Metastatic or disseminated tumours
- Leukemia
- Lymphoma
- Myeloma
- Metastatic solid tumour
  IV. Pathogenesis

1. Pathogenesis
   ➡ Chronic inflammatory process or ongoing hepatocellular damage with high cellular regeneration
   ➡Leads to increased rates of genetic mutations in cells
   ➡Accumulation of these mutations leads to carcinoma formation
2. Pathological appearance
   ➡Gross appearance

- Massive/ Nodular/ Diffuse type
- Soft in texture
- Light-brown or tan-colored masses
- Yellow patches of necrosis
  - Little supportive stroma
- Extensive hemorrhagic areas
  - Tumour is highly vascular
  - Derives blood supply from sinusoids and hepatic artery
- Green discoloration of tumour
  - Production of bile by tumour cells
  - Diagnostic feature of HCC
- Formation of clear cells - Secretion of insulin-like peptide (ILP) - Induce attack of hypoglycemia - Excess glycogen in the tumour (Clear cells)
  ➡Histological appearance
- Trabecular pattern of hepatocytes (80%)
- Pseudoglandular pattern of hepatocytes
- Vascular sinusoids

2. Constitutional symptoms
   ➡ Fatigue
   ➡Nausea and vomiting
   ➡Anorexia and weight loss
   ➡ Fever

- Development of central tumour necrosis

   ➡ Bone pain

4. Paraneoplastic syndrome
   ➡ Hypercalcemia

- Secretion of PTH-rP or associated with osteolytic metastasis to the bone

- Occurs in advanced HCC due to high metabolic needs from tumour and secretion of insulin-
  like growth factor II (IGF-II)
- Can present with lethargy and confusion but usually asymptomatic
  ➡Polycythemia (Erythrocytosis) (↑ RBC)
- Secretion of erythropoietin (EPO)
- Patients are usually anemic at diagnosis due to other effects of tumour

477

VI. Diagnosis

1. Diagnostic guidelines (AASLD)
   ➡Sequence of tests to establish diagnosis in patients should be guided by size of lesion

- Lesion < 1 cm on ultrasound
  - Followed with USG at intervals 6 months (Doubling time = 3 months)
  - Resume routine surveillance if lesion shows no growth over a period of up to 2 years
- Lesion > 1 cm on ultrasound
  - Evaluate with helical multidetector CT with contrast or dynamic MRI
  - Typical features of HCC → No further investigation is required
  - Atypical features of HCC → Repeat CT/MRI (OR) Biopsy

2. Physical examination
   ➡General examination - Obstructive jaundice - Caused by invasion of biliary tree, compression of intrahepatic duct or hemobilia - Stigmata of chronic liver disease
   ➡Abdominal examination - Ascites - Liver bruit - Splenomegaly - Hepatomegaly

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Thrombocytopenia
  ➡Clotting profile
- PT and INR level for Childs-Pugh score
  ➡ LFT
- Hyperbilirubinemia
- Hypoalbuminemia
- ↑ AST and ALT
  - AST > ALT
  - Generally ALT > AST in most liver diseases except in alcoholic liver disease, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
- ↑ ALP and GGT - Any space-occupying lesion (SOL) in the liver can cause elevation in ductal enzymes even without obstruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts
  [Image of a page with information about biochemical tests, specifically CBC with differentials, clotting profile, and LFT, including details such as thrombocytopenia, PT and INR levels, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, AST and ALT levels, and ALP and GGT levels, with bullet points and indentation to show the hierarchy of information.]

➡HBV serology
• Antigen
_ HBsAg: Marker of current infection
_ HBeAg: Marker of active infection
• Antibody
_ Anti-HBs: Marker of recovery of immunity or vaccination
_ Anti-HBe: Marker of inactive virus with partial immunity
_ Anti-HBc: Marker of present or past infection
• DNA
_ HBV DNA: Marker of virus activity

[A table showing the interpretation of HBV serology markers. The table has seven columns: Interpretation, HBsAg, Anti-HBs, HBeAg, Anti-HBe, Anti-HBc (with two subcolumns: IgM and IgG), and HBV DNA. The rows represent different phases of HBV infection, including early phase, window phase, recovery phase, HBeAg +ve chronic hepatitis, HBeAg -ve chronic hepatitis, inactive carrier, exacerbation or flare of chronic HBV, occult HBV infection, and immune due to past infection and immune due to past vaccination. The cells contain plus signs (+), minus signs (-), and plus-minus signs (±) to indicate the presence or absence of each marker in each phase of infection. The "Acute HBV infection" and "Chronic HBV infection" are in bold text, displayed in a dark gray background.]

➡HCV serology

- Anti-HCV antibodies
- HCV RNA
  ➡Serum AFP level (t1/2 =3-6 days)
- AFP > 400 ng/mL (Normal: < 10 ng/mL) requires further investigation on HCC
- 30% of patient has non-AFP elevated HCC (Sensitivity = 70%)
- AFP level correlates with prognosis
  - AFP > 1000 ng/mL has a higher risk of recurrent disease following liver transplantation regardless of tumour size
- Other causes of↑ AFP
  - Pregnancy
  - Germ cell tumours
  - Hepatitis (acute or chronic)
  - Liver cirrhosis
  - Gastric cancer

4. Radiological tests
   ➡Ultrasound (USG)

- Used for screening patients with HCC
- Assess patency of hepatic blood supply and presence of vascular invasion by tumour
- Any dominant solid nodule that is not clearly a hemangioma should be considered HCC unless proven otherwise
- USG findings - Poorly-defined margins - Coarse irregular internal echoes - Hypoechoic in small tumours but hyperechoic/ isoechoic in large tumours
  ➡Triphasic CT scan with contrast of the abdomen
- Evaluate abnormality detected on ultrasound or used as primary screening modality for HCC in patients with cirrhosis
- Triphasic CT scan refers to arterial phase, portal venous phase and delayed phase
  - Arterial phase: Aorta and HCC bright; IVC and portal vein dark
  - Portal venous phase: IVC, portal vein and liver bright; HCC dark
  - Delayed phase: Progressive decrease in contract intensity of lesion
- Typical features of HCC include a rapid arterial phase enhancement (hypervascular) and rapid venous washout (radiolucent)
  - Normal liver has 1/3 blood supply from hepatic artery and 2/3 from portal vein
  - HCC has its majority of blood supply from hepatic artery
    - HCC appears hypervascular during arterial phase and usually not in the portal venous phase
    - HCC appears hypodense during delayed phases due to early washout of contrast medium by the arterial blood
- Comparison with other lesions - Hemangioma = Capsular enhancement in the delayed phase - Liver metastasis = Enhancement in the portal venous phase
  ➡ MRI scan/ MRI angiography (MRA)
- Evaluate abnormality detected on ultrasound or used as primary screening modality for HCC in patients with cirrhosis
- Indicated in patients with contrast allergy or when CT findings are equivocal
- Typical features of HCC include - High-intensity pattern on T2-weighted images and low-intensity pattern on T1- weighted images - Enhances in arterial phase because of hypervascularity and becomes hypointense in delayed phase due to contrast washout after gadolinium injection
  ➡Hepatic arteriography and post-lipiodol CT scan
- Rarely performed nowadays
- Angiography improves detection and characterization of HCC
  - Injection of contrast intra-arterially usually in SMA, hepatic or splenic artery immediately prior to CT scan and obtain arterial and portal venous phases
  - Identification of neovascularization, portal vein thrombosis and AV shunting
- Injection of lipiodol via arteriography and repeat CT scan 2 weeks later
  - Lipiodol is retained in HCC as HCC does not contain Kupffer cells to ingest lipiodol
  - Post-lipiodol CT scan may pick up areas of tumour that is not demonstrated by the pre-lipiodol CT scan

483

➡Dual Tracer PET scan

- (11C) carbon acetate or fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) which is taken up by HCC - Dual tracer is required to increase the sensitivity - 11C-acetate picks up well-differentiated HCC - Half-life (t1/2) of 11-C = 30 mins - FDG picks up poorly differentiated HCC (that has high metabolic activity) - Half-life (t1/2) of FDG = 2 hours - HCC does **NOT** take up FDG well and hence limiting the sensitivity
  ➡Percutaneous liver biopsy
- **NOT** recommended in general due to risk of tumor cell seedling along needle tract making liver transplant unsuitable and risk of bleeding since the liver is hypervascularized
- Indicated only in unresectable cases when diagnostic imaging results are uncertain and require histological diagnosis to guide treatment
- Pathological hallmark for HCC = Stromal invasion
- Immunohistochemical staining to determine liver metastasis of unknown origin - Cytokeratin 7 (CK-7): Lung cancer - Cytokeratin 19 (CK-19): Breast cancer - Cytokeratin 20 (CK-20): Colorectal cancer - Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1): Lung cancer/ Thyroid cancer
  ➡Imaging modalities to detect extra-hepatic metastasis
- CXR/ CT thorax
- Bone scan

VII. Treatment

1. Treatment approach

Hong Kong Liver Cancer (HKLC)
Prognostic classification scheme

[Image Description: A flowchart illustrates the Hong Kong Liver Cancer (HKLC) prognostic classification scheme. The flow starts with an initial stratification based on ECOG performance status and Child-Pugh classification. Patients are divided into those with ECOG 0-1/Child A-B and ECOG 2-4/Child C. The ECOG 0-1/Child A-B group is further branched based on the presence or absence of Extrahepatic Vascular Invasion/Metastasis (EVM). The "No EVM" branch leads to Early Tumor, Intermediate Tumor, and Locally-Advanced Tumor. The "EVM" branch leads to Child A and Child B. The ECOG 2-4/Child C group branches into "Early Tumor, no EVM" and "Other tumors/ EVM". Each of these classifications then directs to specific stages: Stage I, Stage IIa, Stage IIb, Stage IIIa, Stage IIIb, Stage IVa, Stage IVb, Stage Va, and Stage Vb. Each stage then leads to a recommended treatment approach such as Resection/LT/ablation, Resection, TACE, Systemic therapy, Systemic therapy/supportive care, LT, and Supportive care.]

Remarks: EVM = Extrahepatic vascular invasion/metastasis

➡Hong Kong Liver Cancer Staging System

- Tumour in the liver is classified into early, intermediate and advanced based on 0, 1 or ≥ 2 adverse prognostic factors

| Liver tumour status | Size    | Number of nodules | Intrahepatic venous invasion |
| ------------------- | ------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Early               | ≤ 5 cm  | ≤ 3               | No                           |
| Intermediate        | ≤ 5 cm  | ≤ 3               | Yes                          |
|                     | ≤ 5 cm  | > 3               | No                           |

|                     | > 5 cm  | > 3               | Any                          |
|                     | Diffuse | Any               | Any                          |

- Curative treatment = Resection/Ablation/Liver transplantation
- Palliative treatment = TACE/ Systemic therapy

Remarks:

➡ Intrahepatic vascular invasion includes main hepatic vein, intrahepatic portal vein branch, left or right portal vein invasion
➡Extrahepatic vascular invasion includes IVC, main portal vein invasion

2. Hepatic resection
   ➡General features

- Treatment of metastatic cancer to liver - Prolong survival in colorectal metastasis, carcinoid or neuroendocrine tumour - **NOT** indicated in metastasis from lungs and pancreas
  ➡Factors affecting resectability
- Tumour factor
  - Size of tumour
  - Location of tumour
  - **NOT** multicentric disease involving both lobes (Unilobular involvement)
  - **NO** evidence of vascular invasion (IVC or portal vein)
  - **NO** evidence of portal HT
  - **NO** distant metastasis
- Patient factor
  - General fitness of the patient
  - Preoperative liver function (Child-Pugh Class A or early tumour of Class B)
  - Postoperative residual liver function (FLR)
- Physician factor - Availability of surgeons
  ➡Perioperative assessment
- General medical condition
  - Congestive heart failure/ Chronic renal failure
- Extent of tumour involvement
  - MRI or dynamic multiphase CT
  - Most surgeons restrict eligibility for resection to patients with tumors ≤ 5 cm in diameter but tumour number and size itself is not a contraindication
  - Stage IIIB, IIIC and IVA disease are considered incurable by resection as they are defined by invasion of a major portal or hepatic vein, direct invasion of organs other than gallbladder, perforation of visceral peritoneum and nodal or distant metastasis
- Hepatic reserve assessment
  - CT **Hepatic volemetry:** Assess volume and function of future residual liver remnant (FLR) (30% remnant required in normal liver and 40% in cirrhotic liver)
  - **Indocyanine green (ICG) clearance:** ICG retention < 14% at 15 mins required
    - ICG retention ≥ 15% at 15 mins indicates patient **CANNOT** tolerate a major hepatectomy (> 3 segments removed)

487

➡ Liver augmentation

- Portal vein embolization (PVE)
  - Elective obliteration of portal blood flow to a selected portion of liver
  - Elicit a physiological hypertrophic response in the non-embolized portion augmenting the volume of future liver remnant to a safe threshold to permit potentially curative liver resection without post-hepatectomy liver failure
  - Surgery is planned 4 - 8 weeks after PVE to allow adequate time for hypertrophy
- Associating Liver Partition and Portal vein ligation for Staged hepatectomy (ALPPS)
  - 1st stage = Open right portal vein ligation (PVL) and parenchymal transection in the right trisectionectomy plane
  - 2nd stage = Perform a right trisectionectomy after 1 - 2 weeks later when future liver remnant is augmented
  - **Pros**: Accelerated hypertrophy of future liver remnant in a much shorter time
  - **Cons**: Higher morbidity and mortality due to exposure of additional operative risk

➡ Prognosis (50-50)

- Mortality < 5%; Morbidity = 30%
- 5-year survival rate = **50%**
- 5-year recurrence rate = **50%** due to effect of "field cancerization"

488

3. Ablation
   Overview of ablative techniques

- Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
- High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
- Percutaneous ethanol injection
- Microwave ablation
- Cryoablation
  ➡Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)\*
- **MOST** commonly used modality nowadays
- Useful for lesions < 5 cm in diameter with satisfactory liver function reserve
- Insert single needle electrode into tumour via percutaneous, laparoscopic or laparotomy route and induces tumour destruction by heating tumour tissue to temperature exceeding 60°C
  - Heating to even higher temperature will lead to char formation which is a heat insulator and decrease effectiveness in heat transmission
- Tumour close to portal venous system has a special risk
  ➡High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)\*
- Not a standard treatment but currently practiced in QMH
- Uses externally generated sonic waves to create a sharply delineated area of thermal energy that destroys the target tissues
- Advantages of HIFU over RFA - Favorable in patients with ascites - Precise localization - No adhesions in subsequent operation - No needle tracks
  ➡Percutaneous ethanol injection
- Ethanol injection under ultrasound guidance
- Used for lesions ≤ 3 cm in diameter and tumour number ≤ 3
- **NOT** used in QMH since it is quite toxic
  - Injection of liquid (alcohol) into solid (HCC) will lead to leakage into surroundings which is not effective and require multiple injections for ablative effect
  - Alcohol is irritant to liver capsule and peritoneal cavity

489

4. Liver transplantation
   ➡General features

- 5-year-survival rate = 75%
- Liver transplantation scar = Mercedes Benz scar
- MELD score is used to prioritize patients for liver transplantation
- UCSF criteria is used for drop-off criteria in HK
  - Patients who fulfil this criteria is included in the listing for liver transplantation
- Milan criteria is used to select biologically favorable patients for transplantation - Additional bonus mark is given if patients fulfil Milan criteria so that patients who are good candidates for transplantation but with a low MELD score can receive a graft - Too stringent to be used as drop-off criteria since it might exclude patients who can benefit from the procedure
  ➡MELD score
- MELD score components = Creatinine + Bilirubin + INR
  - Serum creatinine is included initially due to consideration of hepatorenal syndrome
  - Serum Na+ is incorporated into MELD score calculation in 2016 (MELDNa) to reflect the vasodilatory state in cirrhosis and the extent of fluid retention causing dilutional hyponatremia which increases mortality
- Assign probability of pre-transplant death corresponding to degree of medical urgency
- Originally designed to predict 3-month survival in patients with liver cirrhosis
- Give priority to patient with the highest MELD score (Transplant benefit when score > 18)
- Status change
  - Priority status will change from time to time since new patients are added
  - No guarantee that next graft will be allocated to patient because allocation is based on priority status on that time

➡ Comparison between Childs-Pugh score VS MELD score (MELD score is better in general)

- NO subjective measurements involved such as degree of ascites or encephalopathy
- Continuous scale for calculation rather than assigning scores to a range of parameters

490

➡UCSF criteria

- Single lesion ≤ 6.5 cm in diameter
- Up to 3 separate lesions largest of which ≤ 4.5 cm in diameter and sum of the diameters (cumulative tumour size) ≤ 8.0 cm
  ➡Milan criteria
- Single lesion ≤ 5 cm in diameter
- Up to 3 separate lesions each ≤ 3 cm in diameter
- **NO** evidence of gross vascular invasion (Portal vein thrombosis)
  - High recurrence rate due to circulating tumour cells
- **NO** regional nodal or distant metastasis
  ➡Contraindications
- Tumours > 5 cm in diameter
- Presence of distant metastasis
- Presence of macroscopic venous invasion (Portal vein thrombosis) - High recurrence rate due to circulating tumour cells
  [Image: The number 491 is printed in the bottom right corner of the page.]

5. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) (肝脈栓塞化學療法) (Patient: 大髀針)
   ➡General features

- Indicated when the above options are not feasible (hepatic resection/ ablation/ liver transplantation) or ruptured HCC
- Subsequent cycle of TACE should be performed at 3 - 4 months interval
  ➡ Indications
- Unresectable tumours
  - Bilobular involvement
  - Unilobular involvement but inadequate liver function status for hepatectomy
- Reasonable liver function
  - Prevent liver failure due to ischemic damage
- **NO** evidence of vascular invasion (IVC or portal vein)
- **NO** distant metastasis
  ➡Contraindications
- Child-Pugh Class C (TACE requires preserved liver function)
- Distant metastasis
- Portal vein thrombosis
  - Embolization of hepatic artery will lead to liver ischemia in the presence of complete obstruction of the portal vein
- Severe AV shunting - Shunting to portal vein is acceptable - Shunting to hepatic vein is contraindicated since systemic lipiodol embolus can potentially cause pulmonary embolism
  ➡Procedures
- Direct arterial injection of chemotherapeutic agents
  - Access via femoral artery and through aorta into the celiac trunk and hepatic artery
  - Chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. cisplatin, doxorubicin) is directly infused into hepatic artery branches that feed the tumours which allows targeting of agents to cancerous tissue (regional chemotherapy)
  - Minimize systemic drug adverse side effects as they are subject to 1st pass effect
- Lipiodol-associated chemotherapeutic agents are retained in cancerous tissue for prolonged period of time
  - Chemotherapeutic agents are mixed with lipiodol by emulsification
  - Lipiodol is an oily contrast agent thought to promote intratumoural chemotherapy retention to allow further targeting of tumour cells
    - Lipiodol is retained in HCC as HCC does not contain Kupffer cells and lymphatics to ingest lipiodol
- Partial embolization of major tumour artery with gelfoam - Promotes tumour necrosis by decreasing blood supply to tumour - Delay flushing out of agents to prevent rapid clearance of the chemotherapeutic agents - Partial but not complete embolization otherwise you cannot perform TACE again

It outlines general features, indications, contraindications, and procedures, using bullet points and nested lists to organize the information. Important notes are emphasized with bold text, and specific medications are mentioned within the procedure descriptions.

492

➡ Complications

- Post-embolization syndrome (**most common**) (60 – 80%)
  - Due to hepatocytes and tumour necrosis and ischemic damage to normal liver parenchyma
  - Presents with fever, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, deranged LFT with ↑ AST/ALT (2:1) transiently for 1 – 2 days
  - Full recovery is typically within 7 – 10 days
  - Cover with antibiotics but should perform USG to exclude liver abscess if symptoms persist for 1 week
- Liver failure (Hepatic decompensation) (**most serious**) (20 – 30%)
  - Treatment-induced ischemic damage to non-tumour bearing liver is responsible for precipitating or exacerbating liver failure
  - Usually reversible but it may be irreversible in 2% of cases
  - Clinically suspected by increased bilirubin level and prolonged PT (INR)
- Ischemic ulceration (due to disturbed GI blood supply)
  - Gastritis/ Cholecystitis/ Pancreatitis
  - Acalculous cholecystitis due to damage to the cholecystic artery

6. Transarterial radioembolization (TARE)
   ➡ General features

- Transarterial radioembolization therapy (TARE) is Yttrium-90 microsphere (TheraSphere) induces extensive tumour necrosis with acceptable safety profile
- Radioactive microspheres are directly injected into hepatic artery branches that supply the tumor and deliver doses of high-energy, low penetration radiation selectively to the tumor
  ➡ Indications
- **NO** consensus as to optimal use of this therapy particularly when it should be chosen over TACE for unresectable HCC
- Preferred over TACE **ONLY** in the setting of an HCC complicated by malignant branch or lobar portal vein thrombosis
  - Less arterial ischemia induced by radioembolization because of the particle size suggesting it should be safer in the setting of portal vein thrombosis

7. Chemotherapy
   ➡ Sorafenib (Oral) (FDA approved)

- Multi-kinase inhibitor which control the vascular growth of tumour
- Indicated in patients with advanced or metastatic disease for palliative treatment only
- Prolong survival on average by 3 months
- Side effects
  - Hand-foot syndrome (acral erythema/ palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia) (10%)
  - Fatigue
  - Diarrhea
    ➡ Lenvatinib (FDA not yet approved)
- Reasonable 1st line alternative especially for patients who cannot tolerate sorafenib
  ➡ Nivolumab
- Immune checkpoint inhibitor (immunotherapy) which is a full human monoclonal antibody that targets programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor restoring T-cell immune activity directed against the tumour cells

493

# VIII. Complications

1. Prognosis of HCC
   ➡4 Reasons of poor prognosis in HCC

- Present in the late stage
  - Asymptomatic when the tumour is < 8 cm
  - NO nerve fibers in the liver and thus patients do not commonly report pain
- Presence of underlying liver diseases
  - 80 – 100% of patients with HCC has underlying liver cirrhosis
    - 80% in patients with HBV infection
    - 100% in patients with HCV infection or alcoholic liver disease
- Early venous permeation
  - High recurrence rate due to circulating tumour cells
- Field cancerization effect
  - Whole liver is exposed to oncogenic influence of HBV/ HCV or liver cirrhosis
  - Presence of multiple small tumours in sites that are not identified

2. Complications of HCC
   ➡ Ruptured HCC

- Leads to intraperitoneal hemorrhage
- Presents with severe abdominal pain with peritoneal signs and shock
- Treatment of choice is transarterial embolism (TAE)
- Uncontrolled bleeding should proceed directly to laparotomy

# IX. Prevention

1. Surveillance intervals
   ➡2017 American Association for Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guideline

- Surveillance should be performed at intervals of 6 months (**Doubling time** = 3 months)
  - 6-month interval is based on expected growth rates of HCC
  - NO difference in clinically relevant outcomes (cumulative focal lesion detection rate/ cumulative HCC incidence/ liver decompensation/ liver transplantation or survival) when compared with **3-month interval** surveillance
  - Better survival when compared with **12-month interval** surveillance
- Follow-up surveillance should be performed with USG
  - USG has a higher sensitivity than AFP

X. Case study
Case 1
A 55-year-old male church helper was admitted with abdominal distension. He was an IV drug abuser when he was about 20 years old, but subsequently converted to Christianity, stopped drug abuse and for over 30 years had been working tirelessly for the church.
Ten years ago, he was found to have abnormal liver function tests and investigations revealed he had chronic hepatitis C, for which he was treated with interferon and ribavirin for 1 year. However, he was told that the treatment was not effective. 5 years ago, he developed mild abdominal swelling and was diagnosed to have fluid in his abdomen. He was advised to limit his fluid intake to around 1 L per day and prescribed some diuretics, whereupon his abdominal distension regressed.
During routine follow-up 10 months ago, he was told that his AFP level was raised and he noticed recurrence of abdominal distension. An USG of the liver performed 2 weeks later, was reported to show some suspicious masses but was inconclusive about their exact nature. Further investigation involving injection of dye into his blood vessel confirmed that he had a malignant tumour in the liver. He was told that surgery was not possible, and was started on injections of chemotherapeutic agents into this thigh artery. These were repeated every 8 weeks and the present admission was for the mild fever for 1 - 2 days and was told that the response to the treatment was good, and that his AFP level had returned to normal.
On the advice of his doctor he had abstained from alcohol, ever since he was diagnosed to have hepatitis C, but he continued to smoke 1 pack of 20 cigarettes per day for over the last 30 years.
Physical examination shows he was not jaundiced but had palmar erythema. There was no abdominal distension, the liver was marginally reduced in size with span of 8 cm at the right MCL and the spleen was palpable 4 cm below the costal margin.
Q1: How would you establish the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma?
➡ Diagnostic level of AFP for HCC = 500 ng/mL (Sensitivity < 70%)

- Acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B and C can give rise to similar levels - Serial measurements of AFP after 2-4 weeks in which AFP decreases after acute exacerbation of hepatitis but not if due to HCC
  ➡ AST and ALT levels
- Can be within normal limits in presence of small HCC
  ➡ USG of liver
- More sensitive test to diagnose early HCC
- Can detect lesions 1-2 cm in diameter
  ➡ CT/MRI of liver
- Detect even smaller lesions than USG
- Essential for the assessment of tumour operability
  ➡ Hepatic arteriogram with post-lipiodol CT scan
- Identification of - Portal vein thrombosis - Tumour staining - Neovascularization - AV shunting
  [A page number 495 is at the bottom right.]

Q2: What other investigations would you like to perform for this patient?
⇨ CBC

- Especially after each course of treatment
- Pancytopenia is rare if chemotherapy is intra-arterial
  ➡HCV RNA
- Monitor continuing viremia
  ⇨LFT
  ➡Serum AFP
- Follow tumour progression or regression
  ➡Clotting profile
- PT to monitor any hepatic decompensation after each course of treatment
  ➡USG/ CT scan liver
- Periodic examination of liver to assess tumour size progression or regression

Q3: What are the routes for hepatitis C virus transmission?
➡Previous blood or blood product transfusion (~50%)
➡Sharing of needles (25%)
➡ Sporadic hepatitis C virus infection

Q4: In what ways is the patient's clinical course typical?
Manifestation of disease after HCV infection

- HCV is presumably acquired via parenteral route and without a symptomatic illness
- His liver cirrhosis manifested > 15 years later
- His HCC manifested > 20 years later
  ➡Higher risk of complication for non-responder to HCV treatment
- Individuals responding to interferon and ribavirin are at much lower risk of future complications but this patient was a non-responder
- He had liver cirrhosis a least 5 years earlier despite his ascites was well-controlled
  ➡HCC is found on top of liver cirrhosis in hepatitis C
- HCC that complicates hepatitis C usually presents on top of a cirrhotic liver
- HCC that complicates hepatitis B usually presents on top of a non-cirrhotic liver since HBV has direct oncogenic effect
  ➡Asymptomatic course until HCC is relatively large
- HCC usually only cause symptoms such as abdominal pain or distension when its size exceeds 8 cm in diameter

Q5: Which patients with chronic hepatitis C infection need treatment and what should they receive?
Indications for treatment

- Patients with elevated ALT levels
  - Indicating active liver destruction
- Patients with +ve HCV RNA - Indicating continuing viremia
  ➡Treatment
- Pegylated interferon once weekly
- Ribavirin
  496

Q6: Why is the prognosis so often very poor in HCC and what clinical or biochemical parameters can
indicate the likely prognosis?
➡Patients present with symptoms at late stage

- Symptoms usually appear till the tumour is > 8 cm in diameter in general
  ➡ Majority of patients have underlying liver cirrhosis which limits scope for resection or other
  interventions
- 80% of HBV patients and 100% of HCV patients
- Predisposes patients to post-treatment liver failure
  ➡Early or pre-malignant lesions are present in other parts of the liver
- High change of a 2nd primary HCC ensuing
- Due to phenomenon known as "field cancerization" in which whole liver is exposed to
  oncogenic influence of HBV/ HCV or liver cirrhosis
  ➡Early IV spread leads to early metastasis or portal vein thrombosis

Q7: What are the contraindications to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE)?
➡Distant metastasis
➡ Moderate or severe liver function impairment
➡AV shunting around the tumour
➡Portal vein thrombosis

- Non-tumorous liver may be completely dependent on hepatic arterial blood supply
  ➡Diffuse HCC
- Response is very unlikely

Q8: What are the 3 curative treatment options for HCC?
➡Hepatic resection
➡Radiofrequency ablation for small tumours
➡ Liver transplantation

Q9: What are the treatment options if curative treatment is not available?
➡Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)
➡ Sorafenib

2. Causes of biliary obstruction (BO)
   ➡**Benign** causes of biliary obstruction

- Blood clot (Hemobilia)/ Mucus/ Foreign body/ Tumour thrombus
- Benign strictures
  - Tuberculosis (TB)
  - Autoimmune
  - Iatrogenic
  - Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC)
- Primary biliary cholangitis (cirrhosis) (PBC)
- Chronic pancreatitis
- Pancreatic cysts
- Mirizzi syndrome - Defined as common hepatic duct obstruction caused by an extrinsic compression from an impacted stone in the cystic duct or Hartmann's pouch of the gallbladder
  ➡**Malignant** causes (MBO)
- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
  - Compression causing obstructive jaundice
    - Usually occurs when mass is situated near confluence site of left and right intrahepatic ducts
    - From anterior liver = Segment 4 / 5
    - From posterior liver = Caudate segment (uncommon)
  - Spread to lymph nodes (porta hepatis) in liver hilum
  - Direct infiltration of CBD
  - Tumour fragments in CBD
- Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) at hilum (Klatskin tumour)
  - Obstruction to just left or right hepatic duct alone will not cause obstructive jaundice
- Carcinoma of gallbladder
  - Spread to cystic duct lymph nodes (LN)
  - Direct infiltration of CBD
  - Tumour fragments in CBD
- Periampullary carcinoma (grouped together since presentation and management are similar for the 4 tumours)
  - Carcinoma of the duodenum
  - Carcinoma of lower end of (distal) CBD
  - Carcinoma of head of pancreas
  - Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater
    - Ampulla of Vater has the best prognosis as it presents earlier
- Secondary hilar lymphadenopathy - GI malignancy (CRC) - Lymphoma
  [Image]
  [Image Description: The bottom right corner of the page displays the number "500".]

3. Causes according to level of obstruction (ddx based on dilatation of different parts of biliary tract)
   ➡ Hilum

- CA Gallbladder
- HCC
- Klatskin's tumour
- Mirizzi syndrome
- Porta lymphadenopathy
- Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
- Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC)
  ➡ Mid-CBD
- CA CBD
- CA Head of pancreas
- Lymphadenopathy
  ➡ Distal CBD
- Bile duct strictures
- Periampullary carcinoma
- Choledochal cysts
- Pancreatic cysts
- Chronic pancreatitis

IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Tea-colored urine and pale stool
   ➡Yellowing of sclera and skin (Jaundice)
   ➡ Weight loss
2. Manifestation of pathophysiological disturbance of MBO
   ➡Bleeding tendency

- Impaired clotting factor synthesis
- Vitamin K deficiency leading to from decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins due to obstructive jaundice
  ➡ Infection (biliary sepsis)
- Endotoxemia when liver is unable to defend against gut endotoxins
- Impaired reticuloendothelial function
- Impaired cell-mediated immunity
  ➡Poor wound healing/ Poor anastomotic healing
- Impaired protein synthesis
  [Image of the number 501, indicating the page number.]

V. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Jaundice
  ➡Abdominal examination
- Scratch marks (Pruritis)\*
- Stigmata of chronic liver diseases
- Signs of inoperability - Irregular surface hepatomegaly - Troisier's sign (Virchow's node) (left supraclavicular LN) - Blumer's shelf (peritoneal metastasis) - Sister Mary Joseph nodules (peritoneal metastasis) - Ascites (peritoneal metastasis)
  ➡Courvoisier's law\*
- **ALWAYS** look for a palpable gallbladder in malignant biliary obstruction
- **Definition** = _"In painless jaundice if the gallbladder is palpable, it is unlikely to be due to gallstones"_ + Points towards malignant biliary obstruction
  - Gallstones develop over a chronic period of time causing chronic cholecystitis will lead to a gallbladder that is fibrosed and contracted and cannot be distended
  - Malignant biliary obstruction develops over an acute period of time and leads to dilatation of gallbladder from back pressure
  - Note that gallstones can sometimes be painless as well so this is not the reason why it is unlikely in painless jaundice
- Exception
  - Double gallstones with one at CBD and another at cystic duct
  - Gallstones at CBD leads to obstructive jaundice
  - Gallstones at cystic duct leads to gallbladder dilatation due to formation of mucocele in a fibrotic gallbladder
  - Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC)
    - Essential pathology is in bile duct instead of the gallbladder
    - Obstruction of CBD without chronic cholecystitis and thus the gallbladder is not fibrosed and can be distended

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Pancytopenia for underlying cirrhosis with hypersplenism
- Leukocytosis for associated biliary sepsis
- Thrombocytopenia when planning for invasive procedures such as ERCP
  ➡Clotting profile
- Coagulopathy due to Vitamin K deficiency leading to from decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins due to obstructive jaundice
  ⇨LFT
- ↑ Bilirubin level
- ↑ ALP and GGT level (Cholestatic pattern)
  ➡ HBV and HCV serology
- Tumour markers
  - **NOT** very useful for MBO as a screening tool and is not included in the initial testing
  - Common tumour markers such as AFP, CA19-9 and CEA are neither sensitive nor specific for periampullary tumours
  - Absence of an elevated tumour markers does not exclude underlying malignancy

502

3. Radiological tests
   ➡ USG/ CT abdomen

- Anatomical imaging
- Look for the size of bile duct for any dilatation ± stones
  - Intrahepatic duct normally not visible on USG (< 2 – 3 mm)
  - Common bile duct (CBD) > 0.8 cm is pathological
- Look for the cause and level of obstruction
  ➡ Endoscopic USG
- Indicated for FNAC or trucut biopsy
- **NO** role in diagnosing CA ampulla of Vater and CA duodenum
- Role of EUS in CA head of pancreas
  - CA head of pancreas normally cannot be seen with OGD unless it has invaded through the wall of duodenum
  - EUS helps to acquire histological diagnosis of CA head of pancreas in order to before attempting Whipple operation
- Role of EUS in cholangiocarcinoma (CC) - EUS with brush cytology can be performed but with low sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing cholangiocarcinoma - EUS cannot reach the lumen of bile duct in majority of cases which will require a mother-baby-cholangioscopy
  ➡ ERCP/ MRCP
- ERCP are both diagnostic and therapeutic
- MRCP can be used for patients without high suspicion of biliary obstruction such as with mild elevation of bilirubin and ALP and equivocal findings on CT scan
  - Largely replace ERCP as diagnostic tools
- Cholangiogram to delineate anatomy of the biliary tree and look for any stones and strictures

503

VI. Treatment

1. General principles

[Flowchart Description: The flowchart starts with two boxes, "General status" and "Tumour status". The "General status" box has two options: "bad" and "good". If the general status is "bad," it leads to "PTBD or endoprosthesis". If the general status is "good," it leads to "laparotomy". The "Tumour status" box has two options: "confined" and "spread". If the tumour status is "spread," it leads to "PTBD or endoprosthesis". If the tumour status is "confined," it leads to "laparotomy". The "laparotomy" option then splits into "bypass if spread" and "radical resection if confined (best)".]

➡Assessment of patient status (good/ bad)

- Age/ Concomitant medical illness
- Hidden medical illness = CXR/ ECG/ Spirometry
- Nutrition = LFT
- Fluid and electrolytes = RFT
- Coagulopathy = CBC/ Clotting profile
  ➡Assessment of tumour status (confined/ spread)
- Clinical assessment (Signs of inoperability)
  - Irregular surface hepatomegaly
  - Troisier's sign (Virchow's node) (left supraclavicular LN)
  - Blumer's shelf (peritoneal metastasis)
  - Sister Mary Joseph nodules (peritoneal metastasis)
  - Ascites (peritoneal metastasis)
- Radiological assessment (Signs of inoperability) - LN metastasis - Distant metastasis - Arterial involvement (SMA/ Celiac axis) - Venous involvement (SMV/ PV) - Portal vein involvement is NOT an absolute contraindication - Venous resection is appropriate to improve resectability and achieve R0 resection (absence of microscopic residual tumour) - Depends on the extent of involvement and QMH may consider resection of portal vein
  ➡Laparotomy is indicated if patient's general status if good and tumour is confined
- No promise of resection until laparotomy finding document absence of spread
- Look for peritoneal nodules after laparotomy before resection and send for frozen section to rule out malignancy if suspicious
  ➡Palliative care for non-resectable diseases
- Treat biliary sepsis
  - Augmentin (OR) Cefuroxime (Zinacef) + Metronidazole (Flagyl)
- Relieve biliary obstruction (Stenting/ PTBD/ Palliative bypass)
- Adequate pain control
  - Celiac plexus block

504

2. Surgical treatment (palliative intent)
   ➡ ERCP with endoprosthesis (endoscopic stenting)

- Indicated for either palliation of unresectable cancer or pre-operative biliary drainage
- ERCP with endoprosthesis is **ALWAYS 1st** line regardless of the level of obstruction especially for periampullary carcinoma except in the following situations
  - Contraindications for ERCP (e.g. structural upper GI abnormalities/ partial gastrectomy with Billroth II or Roux-en-Y anastomosis)
  - Multiple stenting required or difficulty in reaching intrahepatic bile ducts
- ERCP with endoprosthesis is preferred over PTBD
  - PTBD is technically more difficult
  - Bleeding is common due to puncture of hepatic artery or portal vein before reaching the bile duct (Portal triad)
    - Stabilize and resuscitate if necessary
    - Clamp the PTBD catheter
    - Perform cholangiogram by injecting contrast into PTBD to delineate whether the catheter is in hepatic artery or portal vein
    - Remove catheter slowly to control bleeding and do NOT attempt to remove immediately since it will convert into free hemoperitoneum
- Types of stents (Metallic stent VS Plastic stent)
  - Metallic stent is preferred if confirmed inoperable since it is more durable than plastic stent
- Complications
  - Stent occlusion (sludge/ tumour ingrowth/ tumour overgrowth)
  - Stent migration
  - Cholangitis/ Cholecystitis
    ➡ Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD)
- Indicated for either palliation of unresectable cancer or pre-operative biliary drainage
- Simple external PTBD
  - Indicated for short-term drainage to bridge to surgery
  - Prone to electrolyte and fluid loss due to bile output
- External-internal type PTBD
  - Indicated for long-term palliation
  - Catheter can be inserted through the cannula and advanced across an obstruction into the duodenum thereby draining both internally and externally
  - External limb of catheter can be closed to enhance internal drainage and preserve the enterohepatic bile salt circulation while patient does not have to carry a bag
  - Risk of introducing bacteria from the gut into the biliary system causing ascending infection and biliary sepsis
- Procedures
  - Percutaneous access to biliary tree is usually via the left or right intrahepatic ducts and can also be achieved through puncture of gallbladder
    - Left hepatic duct is preferred because the subcostal route used for access is less painful than the intercostal route for right duct and accessing the left duct is less likely to transgress the pleural space
  - Peripheral bile duct is punctured with needle under USG or fluoroscopic guidance and position is confirmed with injection of small volume of contrast
  - Adequate drainage is usually confirmed by a steady decline in serum bilirubin concentration
- Complications
  - Cholangitis/ Biliary sepsis
  - Hemobilia (communication of the tract with a major vascular structure)
    [Image of the number 505 at the bottom right of the page]

➡Palliative bypass

- **Single bypass** = Hepaticojejunostomy/ Choledochojejunostomy
  - Single = Just bypass the biliary tree
  - Hepaticojejunostomy refers to anastomosis between common hepatic duct and jejunum
  - Choledochojejunostomy is not performed in QMH
- **Double bypass** = + Gastrojejunostomy
  - Double = Bypass both biliary tree and enteric obstruction
  - Especially for CA head of pancreas since apart from compression on bile duct it also compresses on duodenum to cause gastric outlet obstruction (GOO)
- **Triple bypass** = + Pancreaticojejunostomy
  - Triple = Bypass biliary tree, enteric obstruction and pancreatic duct
  - Pancreatic duct is small and anastomosis is difficult to achieve which leads to high risk of anastomotic leakage
    ➡ Comparison between stenting/ PTBD with surgical bypass as palliative treatment
- ERCP with endoprosthesis (Endoscopic stenting)/ PTBD
  - Lower initial morbidity and mortality
  - More delayed biliary complications (biliary sepsis)
  - More reinterventions (stent exchange)
- Surgical bypass
  - Higher initial morbidity and mortality
  - Longer hospital stays
  - Better long-term results
    [Image Description: The image is a list of medical terms and procedures. The list is formatted with arrows and bullet points to show the relationships between the different topics. The image is mostly text, with some indentation and bullet points to organize the information. The main topics are types of bypass procedures and a comparison between stenting/PTBD and surgical bypass. Each type of bypass is defined with specific details about the anatomical structures involved.]

3. Surgical treatment (curative intent)
   ➡ Reasons why MBO is high risk for operation and measures to reduce complications

- Cancer cachexia → Malnutrition → Nutritional support
- Liver derangement → Bleeding tendency → IV Vitamin K and FFP during surgery
- Superimposed biliary infection → Antibiotics cover
  ➡ Preoperative biliary drainage
- Achieved either by ERCP with endoprosthesis (endoscopic stenting) or PTBD
- Target level: Serum bilirubin < 50 µmol/L
- **Theoretically:** Do **NOT** need to drain if no sepsis + early surgery can be offered within 1 - 2 weeks
  - Preoperative biliary drainage increases risk of serious complications even in expert hands but surgical-related complications are comparable even without drainage
- **Practically** (QMH): Drain **ALL** patients since QMH cannot offer early surgery
  - Whipple operation has to wait for 6 - 8 weeks and the chance of biliary sepsis will be very high without drainage while waiting for this period
- Advantages
  - Minimize the risk of developing cholangitis
  - Relieves jaundice and pruritus while preventing complications due to cholestasis
  - Allow time for neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced CA head of pancreas
- Disadvantages - Increase the number of interventions and associated costs - Increase risk of procedure-related complications including cholangitis, pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation or blocked stent
  ➡ Surgical treatment is directed at underlying pathology
- Periampullary carcinoma = Whipple operation
  - PPPD can be considered provided that RO resection can be achieved
  - Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD)
    - Shorter operative time
    - Less intraoperative blood loss
    - Improve post-operative nutrition
    - Lower risk of morbidity with decrease in incidence of post-gastrectomy dumping, marginal ulceration and bile reflux gastritis that occur in patients with standard partial gastrectomy
- CA gallbladder = Radical cholecystectomy
  - Radical cholecystectomy includes removal of tumour, part of liver (segment 4b and 5) and the draining LNs
- Klatskin tumour = Major hepatectomy + Caudate lobectomy together with confluence of hepatic ducts
  - Cannot simply remove the bile duct without removing that part of the liver
  - Removal of bile duct the liver will become useless since there is no biliary drainage

VII. Prognosis

1. Causes of mortality in MBO
   ➡ Biliary sepsis
   ➡ Liver failure
   ➡ Cancer cachexia

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

**Cholelithiasis (Gallstones) and Choledocholithiasis (Gallstones in CBD)**
I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Cholelithiasis refers to gallstones disease which can be symptomatic or asymptomatic

- Asymptomatic gallstones are usually discovered on routine imaging studies such as AXR, USG or CT scan or incidentally at laparotomy for unrelated problems
- Symptomatic gallstones usually present as biliary colic due to impaction of gallstone in the outlet of gallbladder or obstructing the cystic duct - 3% of asymptomatic patients becomes symptomatic per year - 2/3 of asymptomatic patients will remain symptom free over 20-year period - Once symptomatic patients tend to have recurrent bouts of biliary colic - Complications develops in < 5% of symptomatic patients per year
  ➡ Choledocholithiasis refers to presence of gallstones within common bile duct (CBD)
- Most cases of choledocholithiasis are secondary to passage of gallstones from gallbladder through the cystic duct into CBD
- Stones rarely originate in the intrahepatic or common hepatic ducts in Western countries but are more common in Asia
  II. Etiology

1. Risk factors for gallstones
   ➡ Demographics (5F = Fourty + Fat + Fertile + Female + Family history) - Females (3x more likely) - Middle age - Pregnancy
   ➡ Medical history - Obesity or rapid weight loss - Diabetes mellitus (DM) - Liver cirrhosis - Crohn's disease - Hyperbilirubinemia - Hemolysis - Thalassemia - Hereditary spherocytosis - Sickle cell disease
   ➡ Drug history - Oral contraceptives - Estrogen replacement therapy
   ➡ Family history - Family history of gallstones - 1st degree relative has 2x risk of developing gallstones

508

### III. Pathogenesis

1. Types of gallstones
   ➡Cholesterol stones

- Majority of cholesterol stones are radiolucent with < 10% are radiopaque
- Common primary event in formation of cholesterol stones is supersaturation of bile with cholesterol
- Pure cholesterol stones
  - Uncommon and accounts for < 10% of cases
- Mixed cholesterol stones
  - Contains various amount of other bile pigments and calcium but always with > 70% of cholesterol by weight

➡ Pigment stones

- Contains < 20% of cholesterol and are dark because of presence of calcium bilirubinate
- Black stones
  - Formed by supersaturation of calcium bilirubinate, carbonate and phosphate
  - Secondary to hemolytic disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis and sickle cell disease
- Brown stones
  - Formed by precipitated calcium bilirubinate and bacterial cell bodies
  - Secondary to bacterial or parasitic infection caused by bile stasis

[Image Description: The number 509 is present in the bottom right corner of the document.]

# IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Symptomatic gallstones

   ➡ Biliary colic (chronic cholecystitis)
   - Pain develops when a stone obstructs the cystic duct resulting in a progressive increase in tension of gallbladder wall
   - Site: RUQ, epigastrium or substernal area
   - Onset: Abrupt onset
   - Character: Intense, dull and usually constant but not colicky (despite the name suggest)
   - Radiation: Radiates to the upper back or between the scapulae
   - Associated symptoms: Sweating, nausea and vomiting
   - Time course: Last ≥ 30 mins, plateau within an hour and subside < 6 hours
     - Episodic with patients suffering discrete attacks of pain between which they feel well
   - Exacerbating factors: Typically after a fatty meal and the intensity is severe to wake the patient from sleep
     - NOT exacerbated by movement
   - Relieving factors: NOT relieved by squatting, bowel movements or passage of flatus

   ➡ Nausea and vomiting

   ➡ NO fever

2. Symptoms of uncomplicated choledocholithiasis

   ➡ Jaundice
   - MOST common manifestation of uncomplicated choledocholithiasis is jaundice
   - Transient jaundice can be caused by a stone that temporarily impacts the ampulla and subsequently moves away
   - Progressive jaundice occurs stones become completely impacted

   ➡ RUQ or epigastric pain
   - Pain in choledocholithiasis is often more prolonged > 6 hours than typical biliary colic
   - Resolved when the stone is either passed spontaneously or is removed

   ➡ Nausea and vomiting

3. Symptoms of complicated choledocholithiasis

   ➡ Gallstone pancreatitis
   - Abdominal pain
     - Site: Epigastric pain but can be in RUQ or rarely LUQ
     - Onset: Rapid onset (gallstones)/ Less abrupt (alcoholism)
     - Character: Severe
     - Radiation: Radiates to the back
     - Associated symptoms: Nausea and vomiting
     - Time course: Persists for several hours to days
     - Relieving factors: Sitting up or bending forward

   ➡ Acute cholangitis
   - Charcot's triad = Fever + Jaundice + RUQ pain
   - Reynolds' pentad = Fever + Jaundice + RUQ pain + Hypotension + Altered mental status

[Image: A line drawing of a handwritten "510" located in the lower right corner of the document.]

4. Differential diagnosis of biliary colic
   ➡Gallbladder polyps

- Adenoma
  - MOST common benign neoplastic lesion
- Cholesterolosis (Cholesterol polyp)
  - MOST common benign non-neoplastic lesion (pseudotumor)
  - Mucosal abnormalities of the gallbladder
  - Caused by accumulation of cholesterol in gallbladder mucosa which produce the classical macroscopic appearance of "strawberry gallbladder"
- Adenomyomatosis
  - Benign non-neoplastic lesion (pseudotumor)
  - Mucosal abnormalities of the gallbladder
  - Characterized by overgrowth of the mucosa, thickening of the muscle wall and intramural diverticula
    ➡Acute cholecystitis
- Prolonged RUQ pain > 6 hours that starts suddenly with fever
- Positive Murphy's sign
  - Palpate area of gallbladder fossa just beneath the liver edge
  - Patient is asked to inspire deeply to descend gallbladder towards the fingers
  - Patients with acute cholecystitis experience increased discomfort and have an associated inspiratory arrest
- Laboratory tests should reveal leukocytosis and increased AST and ALT, bilirubin and serum amylase level
- Radiological tests should reveal gallbladder wall thickening or edema and a sonographic Murphy's sign
  ➡Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction
- Pain typically last < 6 hours and occurs intermittently
  ➡Functional gallbladder disorder
- Pain typically last < 6 hours and occurs intermittently
- Normal laboratory and radiological tests

511

V. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Jaundice
  ➡Abdominal examination
- RUQ or epigastric tenderness
- Gallbladder is usually **NOT** palpable (Courvoisier's Law)
  - "In painless jaundice if the gallbladder is palpable, it is unlikely to be due to gallstones" **EXCEPT** when there is double gallstones at CBD and cystic duct
  - Gallstones develop over a chronic period of time and chronic cholecystitis occurs in which the gallbladder is fibrosed and cannot be distended
  - Malignant obstruction of CBD develops over an acute period of time and leads to dilatation of gallbladder from back pressure

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials - Leukocytosis - Indicates development of acute cholangitis
   ➡LFT - ↑ AST and ALT - Typically elevated in the early course of biliary obstruction - ↑ ALP and GGT - Cholestatic pattern in the later course of biliary obstruction which exceeds the level of AST and ALT - ↑ Bilirubin - Conjugated bilirubin
   ➡Serum amylase and lipase level - Evaluate for the development of acute pancreatitis

512

3. Radiological tests
   ➡Transabdominal ultrasound (USG)\*

- Initial standard imaging study of choice with suspected stones
- Evaluation of cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis and CBD dilatation
- Poor sensitivity in detecting distal CBD stones since it is often obscured by bowel gas in the imaging field
  - Ductal stones are only visible in about 50% of cases due to obscuring gas in the duodenum
  - Dilated CBD > 8 mm together in patients with gallstones, jaundice and biliary pain is suggestive of choledocholithiasis
- Differentiation between gallstones and gallbladder polyps - Presence of posterior acoustic shadow for gallstones - Ask the patient to move and see if the gallstones move around
  ➡Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
- Largely replace ERCP for diagnosis of choledocholithiasis in patients with intermediate risk of choledocholithiasis
- Preferred for many patients over EUS due to non-invasiveness
  ➡ Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
- Largely replace ERCP for diagnosis of choledocholithiasis in patients with intermediate risk of choledocholithiasis
- Considered in patients whom suspicion for choledocholithiasis remains high despite a negative MRCP
  ➡ Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
- Both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in patients
- Preserved for patients with high risk of CBD stones (choledocholithiasis) only - Evidence of acute cholangitis - Evidence of CBD stones demonstrated on other imaging modalities - Evidence of dilated bile duct on abdominal ultrasound
  [Image Description: The number 513 is displayed at the bottom right of the page.]
  513

VI. Treatment of gallstones (Cholelithiasis)

1. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) ± Open
   ➡ Overview

- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is appropriate treatment for vast majority of patients (95%) with symptomatic gallstones with excellent recovery and long-term results
  - Advantages = Less pain/ Shorter hospital stay/ Faster recovery/ Better cosmesis/ Early return of GI function
  - Disadvantages = Higher risk of major bile duct injury\*/ Conversion to open
- Conversion of laparoscopic into open procedure in face of a difficult laparoscopic procedure should never be viewed as surgical failure or complication but rather as a way to avoid potential injury to patients
- Partial cholecystectomy is advocated when ductal and vascular structures in the triangle of Calot cannot be safely identified in the setting of severe acute inflammation
  ➡ Indications
- Symptomatic gallstones with or without complication
- Asymptomatic gallstones in patients at increased risk of gallbladder cancer
  - Porcelain gallbladder which is characterized by calcification of gallbladder wall and is associated with gallstones and chronic gallbladder inflammation is an absolute indication for cholecystectomy
- Asymptomatic gallstones in patients at increased risk of gallstone complications
  - Patients on long-term TPN
- Acalculous cholecystitis
- Gallbladder polyp > 1.0 cm
  ➡ Intraoperative diagnosis
- Intraoperative techniques
  - Intraoperative cholangiography (IOC)
  - Intraoperative ultrasonography
- Indicated in the following situations
  - Clinical: Jaundice/ Pancreatitis
  - Biochemical: Deranged LFT
  - Radiological: Dilated biliary tract on USG
  - Anatomical: Large cystic duct/ Small gallstones
- Intraoperative to assist anatomical definition especially when the critical view of safety is not achieved

[Image of Critical view of safety in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, showing the cystic artery, cystic duct, common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right hepatic artery and left hepatic artery]

➡ Dissection of the hepatocystic triangle (Calot's triangle)

- Hepatocystic triangle (Calot's triangle) is bounded by gallbladder wall, cystic duct and common hepatic duct
- Consists of the cystic artery (although the right hepatic artery may occasionally loop onto the infundibulum as an anatomical variant)
- Thorough dissection of the hepatocystic triangle (Calot's triangle) is required to obtain the critical view of safety which is to clearly identify the cystic artery and duct prior to division and removing the gallbladder
  ➡ Critical view of safety
- Technique to provide a conclusive identification of cystic duct and artery since misidentification of cystic duct is the commonest cause of biliary injury
- Critical view of safety is a "window" where only 2 structures including cystic artery and duct enter the gallbladder
- Achieved by exposing the base of liver bed and dissecting Calot's triangle free of all tissues except for cystic artery and duct
- 2 Structures emanating from the gallbladder (cystic artery and duct) should be definitely identified prior to clipping or dividing any tubular structures in a laparoscopic cholecystectomy
- Difficulty with obtaining the critical view should lead the surgeon to consider performing intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) or converting laparoscopic into open procedure

VII. **Treatment of gallstones in CBD (Choledocholithiasis)**

1. Overview
   ➡ Management depends on the clinical suspicion of CBD stones

- Clinical suspicion of CBD stone is **high** → ERCP followed by interval cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC)
  - USG evidence of CBD stones or dilated biliary tract
  - Clinical ascending cholangitis
- Clinical suspicion of CBD stone is **moderate** → MRCP or EUS to exclude CBD stones before proceeding to cholecystectomy
  - Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) is preferred over ERCP
- Clinical suspicion of CBD stone is **low** → Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) during the procedure
  - Proceed to laparoscopic ECBD if stones are seen
  - If laparoscopic ECBD failed → Proceed to open ECBD, intraoperative or post-operative ERCP
    515

2. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
   ➡Endoscopic sphincterotomy

- Most commonly used therapy to treat choledocholithiasis
- Cut the biliary sphincter to eliminate the principal anatomic barrier impeding stone passage and facilitate stone extraction
- Involves use of electrocautery to create an incision through the musculature of the biliary portion of sphincter of Oddi
- Complications
  - Short-term = Acute pancreatitis/ Perforation of duodenum or bile duct/ Bleeding / Infection
    - **Intraperitoneal perforation**: Perforate the duodenum
      - ➤ Presence of free gas under diaphragm in CXR
      - ➤ Requires operative treatment since it will not seal off by itself
    - **Retroperitoneal perforation**: Perforate the bile duct when cutting open the ampulla since it is located in the retroperitoneal portion of duodenum
      - ➤ Absence of free gas under diaphragm in CXR
      - ➤ Retroperitoneal gas may be present
      - ➤ Conservative treatment since it will seal off by itself
  - Long-term = Acute cholangitis/ Stone recurrence/Papillary stenosis
    ➡Papillary balloon dilation (Balloon sphincteroplasty)
- Dilation of ampulla with a balloon with an attempt to preserve the biliary sphincter due to concerns regarding long-term complications related to endoscopic sphincterotomy
- Preserved sphincter function with lower risk of bleeding
- Safety has been questioned and until more data is available, endoscopic sphincterotomy remains to be the method of choice
  ➡Method of stone retrieval
- Balloon catheter
  - Indicated when the duct is **NOT** dilated, if there is a single free-floating stone, multiple small stones or when a large stone is crushed
- Baskets
  - Indicated when the duct is dilated or when multiple large stones are present
    - Reason not using balloon in dilated duct or when stone is impacted is that the balloon may simply squeeze between the stone and the wall
  - Risk of basket extraction is impaction of basket within the bile duct - Results from imbedding of the basket's wires within the stone surface and thus the basket may not be removable from the stone which anchors the basket within the bile duct - Once basket is impacted it may not be possible to regain access to bile duct to perform additional therapeutic maneuver
    ➡ Mechanical lithotripsy
- Indicated in patients where standard methods of stone extraction fail
- Mechanical lithotripters are devices that are designed to break stones that have been captured within a basket

3. Cholecystectomy
   Overview

- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is appropriate treatment for vast majority of patients (95%) with symptomatic gallstones with excellent recovery and long-term results
  - Advantages = Less pain/ Shorter hospital stay/ Faster recovery/ Better cosmesis/ Early return of GI function
  - Disadvantages = Higher risk of major bile duct injury\*/ Conversion to open
- Conversion of laparoscopic into open procedure in face of a difficult laparoscopic procedure should never be viewed as surgical failure or complication but rather as a way to avoid potential injury to patients
- Partial cholecystectomy is advocated when ductal and vascular structures in the triangle of Calot cannot be safely identified in the setting of severe acute inflammation
  Indications
- Symptomatic gallstones with or without complication
- Asymptomatic gallstones in patients at increased risk of gallbladder cancer
  - Porcelain gallbladder which is characterized by calcification of gallbladder wall and is associated with gallstones and chronic gallbladder inflammation is an absolute indication for cholecystectomy
- Asymptomatic gallstones in patients at increased risk of gallstone complications
  - Patients on long-term TPN
- Acalculous cholecystitis
- Gallbladder polyp > 0.5 cm
  Dissection of the hepatocystic triangle (Calot's triangle)
- Hepatocystic triangle (Calot's triangle) is bounded by gallbladder wall, cystic duct and common hepatic duct
- Consists of the cystic artery (although the right hepatic artery may occasionally loop onto the infundibulum as an anatomical variant)
- Thorough dissection of the hepatocystic triangle (Calot's triangle) is required to obtain the critical view of safety which is to clearly identify the cystic artery and duct prior to division and removing the gallbladder
  Critical view of safety
- Technique to provide a conclusive identification of cystic duct and artery since misidentification of cystic duct is the commonest cause of biliary injury
- Critical view of safety is a "window" where only 2 structures including cystic artery and duct enter the gallbladder
- Achieved by exposing the base of liver bed and dissecting Calot's triangle free of all tissues except for cystic artery and duct
- 2 Structures emanating from the gallbladder (cystic artery and duct) should be definitely identified prior to clipping or dividing any tubular structures in a laparoscopic cholecystectomy
- Difficulty with obtaining the critical view should lead the surgeon to consider performing intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) or converting laparoscopic into open procedure

4. Common bile duct exploration (ECBD)
   [Image of a diagram showing the anatomy of the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts with a T-tube inserted into the common bile duct. The T-tube is a medical device shaped like the letter "T" used to drain bile after surgery on the bile ducts. The diagram highlights the T-tube's placement and its connection to the common bile duct and duodenum. The liver is brown, the gallbladder is green, the bile ducts are tan and the t-tube is red. The image is labeled as "T-tube drainage following CBD exploration."]
   [Image of a flowchart depicting the action after a T-tube cholangiogram. The flowchart branches based on the presence or absence of residual CBD stones. If there are no residual CBD stones, the path leads to "Spigot T-tube," followed by decisions based on fever (+ve or -ve). If fever is present, redo cholangiogram is suggested. If fever is absent, the T-tube should remain spigotted for 4-6 weeks, then the T-tube is removed. If there are residual CBD stones, the path leads to keeping the T-tube for 6-8 weeks, followed by choledochoscopy via the fibrous T-tube tract.]

➡Indications

- Patients with confirmed CBD stones but have failed or contraindicated for ERCP should be have their ductal stones managed during the cholecystectomy

➡Types of ECBD

- Open ECBD
- Laparoscopic ECBD: Exploration via the cystic duct (transcystic) or with formal choledochotomy (incision into CBD itself)

➡T-tube placement

- T tube should be placed with one end left in CBD and the other end taken out through the abdominal wall when there is concern for additional manipulation
- T-tube should be left in place for 4-6 weeks to induce fibrous tract formation
- Functions of T-tube
  - Post-operative biliary decompression
  - Prevent bile leakage from suture line of choledochotomy
  - Provides access to bile duct for postoperative cholangiography to check for any residual stones
  - Provides access for choledochoscopy for possible extraction of residual stones through T-tube tract
    - T-tube is kept for 6-8 weeks to induce fibrous tract formation
    - Choledochoscopy after fibrous T-tube tract and stones are retrieved with balloons or baskets under fluoroscopic guidance
- Complications
  - Bile leak, infection, tube dislodgement or bile duct obstruction

➡Intraoperative measures to clear CBD stones

- Balloon catheter
- Baskets
- Saline irrigation after sphincter of Oddi is relaxed with glucagon
  - Flush the stones into duodenum if they are small in size

518

VIII. Complication

1. Complications of gallstones
   ➡ In the gall bladder

- Calculous cholecystitis\*
- CA Gallbladder\*
- Mucocele of the bladder (Hydrops of gallbladder)
  - Prolonged impaction of a stone in the cystic duct without cholecystitis can lead to a distended gallbladder that is filled with colorless, mucoid fluid known as mucocele with white bile (hydrops of the gallbladder)
  - Due to the absence of bile entry into the gallbladder and the bile gets absorbed but the gallbladder epithelium continues to secrete mucus and gallbladder becomes distended with mucinous material
    - Gallbladder may be palpable but usually it is non-tender
  - Hydrops of gallbladder may result in edema of gallbladder wall, infection, inflammation and perforation
  - Can persists with few consequences but early cholecystectomy is generally indicated to avoid complications
    ➡ In the bile duct
- Choledocholithiasis ± Acute cholangitis\*
- Gallstone pancreatitis
- Obstructive jaundice
  ➡ Perforation to other sites
- Bowel = Gallstone ileus\*
  - Cholecystocholedochal/ Cholecystoduodenal/ Cholecystoenteric fistula
- Liver = Liver abscess
- CBD = Mirizzi syndrome

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Acute cholangitis

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Cholangitis is one of the 2 most common complications of CBD stones with the other being gallstone pancreatitis
   ➡Clinical syndrome characterized by fever, jaundice and abdominal pain
   ➡Result from stasis and infection in biliary tract
   II. Pathogenesis
1. Pathophysiology
   ➡Normal barrier mechanisms - Continuous flushing action of bile - Bacteriostatic activity of bile salts - Biliary mucous and secretory IgA function as anti-adherence factors to prevent bacterial colonization - Sphincter of Oddi acts as an effective mechanical barrier to duodenal reflux and ascending bacterial infection
1. Pathogenesis
   ➡Biliary obstruction and stasis - Predisposes to bacterial infection of biliary tree - Ascending infection from duodenum - Hematogenous spread from portal veins
   ➡Disrupted normal barrier mechanism - Normal barrier is disrupted after endoscopic sphincterotomy, biliary stent insertion and choledochal surgery - Incomplete biliary drainage or biliary stent blockage predisposes to acute cholangitis - Presence of foreign body serves as a nidus for bacterial colonization
   ➡Combination of biliary obstruction and significant bacterial contamination is required for the development of acute cholangitis - Biliary bacterial contamination alone does not lead to clinical cholangitis - Obstruction without bacteria = Obstructive jaundice - Obstruction with bacterial overgrowth = Acute cholangitis (infection of bile duct)
1. Bacteriology
   ➡Gram +ve organisms - Enterococcus sp.
   ➡Gram -ve organisms - Escherichia coli - Klebsiella pneumoniae - Enterobacter sp. - Bacteroides fragilis

520

III. Etiology

1. Causes of acute cholangitis
   ➡Choledocholithiasis (most common)
   ➡Benign or malignant strictures (MBO) of bile ducts or at biliary-enteric anastomosis
   ➡Indwelling stents (stent occlusion) or instrumentation of ducts
   ➡ Tumours
   ➡Parasitic infection

IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Charcot's triad (present in 2/3 of patients)

- Fever
- Abdominal pain
- Jaundice
  ➡Reynolds pentad (present in < 10% of patients)
- Fever
- Abdominal pain
- Jaundice
- Hypotension
  - Occurs in suppurative cholangitis
  - Septic shock subsequently leading to multiorgan failure
- Altered mental status (Confusion)
  - Occurs in suppurative cholangitis

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Differential diagnosis of fever and abdominal pain

- Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis
- Acute cholecystitis
- Acute pancreatitis
- Acute appendicitis
- Liver abscess
- Biliary leaks

[Image Description: The image is a PDF page with text in a two-column layout. The left column contains content related to medical information.The page is numbered "521" at the bottom right corner.]

V. Diagnosis

1. Diagnostic criteria
   ➡Diagnosis should be suspected if the patient

- Has ONE of the following (AND)
  - Fever or shaking chills
  - Laboratory evidence of an inflammatory response (Abnormal WBC/Increased CRP/ Other changes suggestive of inflammation)
- Has ONE of the following - Jaundice - Abnormal liver chemistries (Increased AST/ALT/ALP/GGT)
  ➡Diagnosis is considered definite if, in addition to meeting the criteria for a suspected diagnosis
- Has BOTH of the following
  - Biliary dilation on imaging
  - Evidence of an etiology on imaging such as stone, stricture or stent

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials - Leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance
   ➡Clotting profile
   ➡Inflammatory markers - ↑ ESR and CRP
   ⇨ LFT - ↑ ALP and GGT (Cholestatic pattern) - ↑ Conjugated bilirubin
   ⇨ RFT
   ➡ Urinalysis - Bile (Conjugated bilirubin)
   ➡ Blood/Bile culture\* - With antibiotics susceptibility test - Positive bile cultures are common in the presence of bile duct stones as well as with other causes of obstruction
3. Radiological tests
   ➡Transabdominal ultrasound (USG)

- Evaluate for CBD stones and dilatation
- May be negative when only small stones are present in bile ducts or with acute obstruction when bile duct has yet to be dilated
  ➡ Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
- Both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in patients - Confirm diagnosis and show the level and cause of obstruction - Provides biliary drainage with drainage catheters or stents - Allow removal of stones or indwelling foreign bodies - Allow culture of bile
  ➡Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
- Indicated in normal transabdominal USG but high clinical suspicion for acute cholangitis
- Evaluate for bile duct stones or alternative diagnosis that has may have been missed on transabdominal USG
  522

VI. **Treatment**

1. General principles
   ➡Continuous monitoring of vitals to look for signs of failure of conservative treatment

- ↑ Temperature/ Pulse
- ↓BP/ Consciousness level/ Urine output
- Increased abdominal tenderness and guarding
  ➡Management of sepsis
- Recognize signs of shock including hypotension, oliguria, changes in mental status, cold and clammy skin and metabolic acidosis
- Supportive treatment such as fluid resuscitation to prevent multiorgan failure
  ➡Biliary decompression and drainage
- 15% of patients will **NOT** respond to antibiotics and emergency biliary decompression
  - Endoscopic = ERCP
  - Radiologic (Percutaneous) = PTBD/ Percutaneous cholecystostomy
  - Surgical = ECBD/ Bypass/ Resection
- QMH _practice_ = ERCP → PTBD → ECBD
- Patients who failed ERCP and PTBD will require operative intervention via ECBD with T-tube placement to decompress the biliary tree
  ➡Definitive treatment should be deferred until cholangitis has been treated and the proper diagnosis is established
- Patients with indwelling stents and cholangitis usually require repeated imaging and stent removal and replacement
- Patients with benign and malignant strictures should have definitive operative therapy deferred at a later date

2. Medical treatment
   ➡ Analgesics
   ➡IV fluid resuscitation
   ➡IV Antibiotics

- Empirical antibiotics should cover for gram -ve aerobes and anaerobes
  - Ampicillin-sulbactam/ Piperacillin-tazobactam/ Ticarcillin-clavulanate (OR)
  - Metronidazole + 3rd generation cephalosporin (e.g. Ceftriaxone) (OR)
  - Metronidazole + Fluoroquinolones (e.g. Ciprofloxacin/Levofloxacin)

[Image: The number 523 is at the bottom right of the page.]

3. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
   ➡Endoscopic sphincterotomy

- Most commonly used therapy to treat choledocholithiasis
- Cut the biliary sphincter to eliminate the principal anatomic barrier impeding stone passage and facilitate stone extraction
- Involves use of electrocautery to create an incision through the musculature of the biliary portion of sphincter of Oddi
- Complications - Short-term = Acute pancreatitis/ Perforation of duodenum or bile duct/ Bleeding / Infection - Intraperitoneal perforation: Perforate the duodenum - Presence of free gas under diaphragm in CXR - Requires operative treatment since it will not seal off by itself - Retroperitoneal perforation: Perforate the bile duct when cutting open the ampulla since it is located in the retroperitoneal portion of duodenum - Absence of free gas under diaphragm in CXR - Retroperitoneal gas may be present - Conservative treatment since it will seal off by itself - Long-term = Acute cholangitis/ Stone recurrence/Papillary stenosis
  ➡Papillary balloon dilation (Balloon sphincteroplasty)
- Dilation of ampulla with a balloon with an attempt to preserve the biliary sphincter due to concerns regarding long-term complications related to endoscopic sphincterotomy
- Preserved sphincter function with lower risk of bleeding
- Safety has been questioned and until more data is available, endoscopic sphincterotomy remains to be the method of choice
  ➡Method of stone retrieval
- Balloon catheter
  - Indicated when the duct is **NOT** dilated, if there is a single free-floating stone, multiple small stones or when a large stone is crushed
- Baskets - Indicated when the duct is dilated or when multiple large stones are present - Reason not using balloon in dilated duct or when stone is impacted is that the balloon may simply squeeze between the stone and the wall - Risk of basket extraction is impaction of basket within the bile duct - Results from imbedding of the basket's wires within the stone surface and thus the basket may not be removable from the stone which anchors the basket within the bile duct - Once basket is impacted it may not be possible to regain access to bile duct to perform additional therapeutic maneuver
  ➡ ERCP with endoprosthesis (endoscopic stenting)/ Nasobiliary catheter
- Endoprosthesis (endoscopic stenting)
  - Placement of stent within bile duct without sphincterotomy permits adequate drainage in patients with coagulopathy
- Nasobiliary catheter
  - Placement of nasobiliary catheter is another option in patients with coagulopathy that prevent sphincterotomy
  - Permits active decompression of CBD by aspiration and provides a route for irrigation of biliary system

524

4. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD)
   ➡ Indicated when ERCP is unsuccessful, unavailable or contraindicated
   - PTBD is more invasive as compared with ERCP
     ➡ Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) permits therapeutic interventions including drainage of infected bile, extraction of biliary duct stones, dilation of benign strictures or placement of a stent across malignant strictures
     ➡ Procedures
   - Percutaneous access to biliary tree is usually via the left or right intrahepatic ducts and can also be achieved through puncture of gallbladder
     - Left hepatic duct is preferred because the subcostal route used for access is less painful than the intercostal route for right duct and accessing the left duct is less likely to transgress the pleural space
   - Peripheral bile duct is punctured with needle under USG or fluoroscopic guidance and position is confirmed with injection of small volume of contrast
   - Adequate drainage is usually confirmed by a steady decline in serum bilirubin concentration

5. Surgical drainage
   ➡ Surgical drainage for acute cholangitis is reserved for patients in whom other methods of biliary drainage cannot be performed or have failed
   ➡ Treatment according to underlying causes
   - Choledocholithiasis
     - Laparoscopic/ Open ECBD with removal of stones and placement of T-tube (OR)
     - Cholecystectomy in patients who are hemodynamically stable
   - Malignant biliary obstruction (MBO)
     - Resection (Whipple operation)
     - Bypass (Hepaticojejunostomy/ Choledochojejunostomy)

525

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC)

I. Overview

1.  General features
    ➡ Characterized by recurrent bouts of cholangitis caused by stone formation resulting in stricturing
    of biliary tree and biliary obstruction

- Abnormal bile ducts characterized by intrahepatic and extrahepatic ductal dilatation with
  focal areas of stricturing in intrahepatic biliary tree
- Small intrahepatic ducts are more affected than large ducts
  ➡ Differences with gallstones related disease
- Stones are formed de novo within intrahepatic bile ducts in contrast with the more
  common pattern of stone formation within gallbladder
- Stones are composed of brown pigment or calcium bilirubinate in contrast with
  cholesterol stones
- Pigment stones are formed when bacterial glucuronidase break down bilirubin
  glucuronide in bile ducts into unconjugated bilirubin
- Calcium bilirubinate stones are formed when unconjugated bilirubin complexes
  with calcium

II. Epidemiology

1.  General epidemiology
    ➡ Found exclusively in people who live in Southeast Asia

- Nomenclature for RPC includes Hong Kong disease, biliary obstruction syndrome of the
  Chinese and Oriental cholangitis
  ➡ Occurs in equal frequency in males and females
  ➡ Occurs with a peak prevalence in 30 - 40s

III. Etiology

1.  Bacterial infection
    ➡ Gram -ve bacilli

- Escherichia coli
- Klebsiella sp.
- Proteus sp.
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  ➡ Anaerobes

2.  Parasitic infection
    ➡ 3 Major liver trematodes or flukes that infect humans

- Clonorchis sinensis
- Opisthorchis viverrini
- Fasciola hepatica
  ➡ Roundworms
- Ascaris lumbricoides

526

IV. **Pathogenesis**

1. Components for pathogenesis of RPC
   ➡ Stasis + Stricturing + Recurrent infection

- Stone formation lead to a cycle of persistent obstruction predisposing to stasis and recurrent infection with additional stone formation
- Stricture formation is the result of repeated episodes of inflammation and healing

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Charcot's triad

- Fever
  - With or without chills
- Abdominal pain
  - RUQ or epigastric pain
- Jaundice

VI. **Diagnosis**

1. Radiological tests
   ➡ USG abdomen

- Initial imaging modality to look for stones and ductal dilatation
- Liver abscess may be present
  ➡ CT abdomen
- Demonstrate whether disease is localized (usually to the left lobe) and whether atrophy has developed
  ➡ Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
- Non-invasiveness and permits detailed visualization of extent of biliary involvement which may not be possible by ERCP when there is extensively occluded segments
- Does **NOT** permit therapeutic interventions
  ➡ Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
- Prophylactic antibiotics is required due to risk of inciting cholangitis or sepsis following manipulation of bile ducts

527

VII. **Treatment**

1. General approach
   ➡Biliary decompression
   ➡Management of sepsis with adequate fluid resuscitation
   ➡Antibiotic prophylaxis
2. Surgical treatment
   ➡Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
   _ Initial biliary decompression is achieved by ERCP with sphincterotomy, stricture dilatation and placement of biliary endoprosthesis (stent) often required
   _ Endoscopic intervention is challenging due to multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic stones as well as stricturing
   _ Patients in whom adequate drainage cannot be achieved during ERCP will require percutaneous or surgical drainage
   ➡Hepatobiliary resection with biliary-enteric anastomosis
   _ Resection of the hepatobiliary segments with the aim to resect areas of recurrent infection, biliary stasis and hepatic atrophy \* Hepaticojejunostomy is frequently required where as standard biliary drainage procedures such as choledochoduodenostomy or choledochojejunostomy are contraindicated since residual strictured biliary segments may not be drained adequately

VIII. **Complication**

1. Hepatobiliary complications
   ➡Secondary biliary cirrhosis
   ➡Cholangiocarcinoma\*
   ➡Portal vein thrombosis
   ➡Liver failure
2. Specific complications of RPC
   ➡Biliary sepsis
   ➡Pancreatitis
   _ Result of passage of biliary stones
   ➡Rupture
   _ Rupture of obstructed pus-filled bile ducts into peritoneum
   ➡Abscess formation
   _ Liver abscess or abscess at distant sites including lungs and brain
   ➡Fistulization
   _ Formation of choledocho-duodenal fistula into gastrointestinal tract or abdominal wall

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

# Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Chronic progressive disorder of unknown etiology that is characterized by inflammation, fibrosis
   and stricturing of bile ducts in **intrahepatic** or **extrahepatic** biliary tree

- Ascending cholangitis in which large ducts are affected more than small intrahepatic duct
- Leads to complications of cholestasis and liver failure ultimately
  ➡ The term "primary" is used to distinguish PSC from other conditions that may lead to a similar
  clinical and cholangiographic syndrome

2. Associated medical conditions
   ➡Inflammatory bowel disease

- **STRONG** association between primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis
  - Majority of patients with PSC have underlying UC
  - Only 5% of patients with UC have underlying PSC and hence it is not recommended to screen patients with IBD

II. Etiology

1. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Causes of secondary sclerosing cholangitis

- Chronic bacterial cholangitis
- Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis
- Choledocholithiasis
- Cholangiocarcinoma
- Recurrent pancreatitis
- Surgical biliary trauma
  ➡Autoimmune pancreatitis/ IgG4-associated cholangitis
  ➡Autoimmune hepatitis-PSC overlap syndrome

III. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms (Asymptomatic at diagnosis = 50% and detected as part of the evaluation of
   abnormal liver tests in patients with IBD)
   ➡ Pruritus

- Common symptoms resulting from cholestasis that can lead to severe excoriations
  ➡ Fatigue
- Common symptoms in patients who are symptomatic
  ➡RUQ discomfort
  ➡ Constitutional symptoms
- Fever and chills
- Night sweats
  [Image Description: The image is a digital representation of the number "529" in a simple, sans-serif font. The number is positioned near the bottom right corner of the image. The background is plain white, providing a clean and clear contrast that highlights the number. The digits are uniform in size and spacing, making them easily readable.]

IV. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Jaundice
  ➡Abdominal examination
- Excoriations
- Hepatomegaly
- Splenomegaly

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡LFT (Cholestatic pattern)

- ↔/↑ AST and ALT
  - Serum aminotransferases are typically less than 300 IU/L
- ↑ ALP and GGT
  - ALP is the predominantly elevated
- ↔/ ↑ Bilirubin
  - Bilirubin may fluctuate substantially possibly indicating transient blockage of strictured bile ducts by biliary sludge or small stones
- ↔ / ↓ Albuminemia - Serum albumin is normal in patients with early stage disease but those with active IBD may have hypoalbuminemia
  ➡Anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA)
- AMA is typically absent in PSC and is required to help exclude primary biliary cholangitis
  ➡Serum IgG4 level
- Serum IgG4 is a characteristic marker of autoimmune pancreatitis but is also elevated in patients with PSC
- IgG4-associated disease have a more rapidly progressive course and appear to be less likely to respond to corticosteroids
  ➡Autoantibodies
- ↑ Serum IgM levels (40 – 50%)
- Hypergammaglobulinemia (30%)
- Presence of P-ANCA (30 – 80%)

530

3. Radiological tests
   ➡ USG abdomen - Bile duct abnormalities - Bile duct wall thickening - Focal bile duct dilations - Gallbladder abnormalities - Gallbladder wall thickening and enlargement - Presence of gallstones
   ➡ Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) - Indicated in patients who are unable to undergo MRCP such as those with implanted metal devices or in patients with early PSC changes that may be missed by MRCP
   ➡ Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) - Typically the 1st imaging modality due to non-invasiveness and comparable diagnostic accuracy to ERCP - Characteristic multifocal strictures that alternate with dilation of intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts resulting in "beaded" appearance of bile duct
   ➡ Liver biopsy - Percutaneous liver biopsy may support diagnosis of PSC but is rarely diagnostic and is not routinely recommended - Reserved for patients with suspected small duct PSC or if an overlap syndrome with autoimmune hepatitis are suspected

V. Treatment

1. Medical treatment
   ➡ Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) - **NOT** generally recommended in PSC due to uncertain benefits
   ➡ Immunosuppressants - **NONE** of the following agents are proven to alter the natural history of the disorder - Example: Glucocorticoid/ Cyclosporine/ Methotrexate/ Azathioprine/ Tacrolimus
2. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Endoscopic therapy - Patients with dominant stricture or cholangitis should undergo endoscopic therapy to dilate or stent the stricture to relief jaundice and pruritus
   ➡ Liver transplantation - Treatment of choice for patients with advanced liver disease due to PSC

531

VI. Complication

1. Usual complications for cirrhosis
   ➡ Liver cirrhosis

- Non-specific symptoms including anorexia, weight loss, weakness and fatigue
- Signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation - Abdominal distension from ascites - Confusion from hepatic encephalopathy - Hematemesis from esophageal variceal bleeding
  ➡ Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
- Patients with PBC and cirrhosis are at increased risk of HCC

2. Specific complications
   ➡ Steatorrhea and vitamin deficiency (malabsorption of dietary fat)

- Result of decreased biliary secretion of bile acids
- Leads to decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K - Vitamin A and D deficiency are more common requiring supplementation - Measurement of serum vitamin A and calcidiol is required
  ➡ Hepatic osteodystrophy
- Metabolic bone disease includes osteopenia and osteoporosis or rarely osteomalacia
- Characteristics bone disorders in primary biliary cirrhosis which reflects the inhibitory effect of a retained toxin on the osteoblast which prevent it from functioning normally
  ➡ Biliary strictures
- Up to 60% of patients may develop a dominant stricture in intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary tree
  ➡ Choledocholithiasis and cholelithiasis
- Due to cholesterol or pigment stones
  ➡ Cholangitis
- Develop spontaneously in patients with bile duct stones or obstructing strictures or in patients after undergoing endoscopic or surgical manipulation
  ➡ Cholangiocarcinoma
- High incidence of cholangiocarcinoma necessitates screening including USG or MRCP with a measurement of serum CA19-9
  ➡ Gallbladder cancer

**Primary biliary cholangitis (cirrhosis) (PBC)**

I. Overview

1.  General features
    ➡ Primary biliary cholangitis (formerly called primary biliary cirrhosis) is characterized by a T-lymphocyte-mediated attack on small intralobular bile ducts
    - Continuous assault on bile duct epithelial cells leads to their gradual destruction with eventual disappearance
    - Sustained loss of intrahepatic bile ducts leads to signs and symptoms of cholestasis and eventually results in liver cirrhosis and liver failure
2.  Associated medical conditions
    ➡ Thyroid disorders
    - Hashimoto's thyroiditis (10–15%)
      ➡ Rheumatological disorders
    - Sjogren's syndrome (40–65%)
    - Systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma) (5–10%)
    - Rheumatoid arthritis (5–10%)

II. Epidemiology

1.  General epidemiology
    ➡ Extreme female predominance (90–95%)
    ➡ Age of diagnosis = 30–65 (middle-aged)

III. Clinical manifestations

1.  Signs and symptoms (Asymptomatic at diagnosis = 50–60%)
    ➡ Pruritus
    - Pruritus and fatigue are the most commonly seen manifestation
    - Itchiness is worse at night and often precedes the development of jaundice
      ➡ Fatigue
    - Pruritus and fatigue are the most commonly seen manifestation
      ➡ Steatorrhea
    - ↓ Bile acid production
      ➡ RUQ discomfort

IV. Diagnosis

1. Diagnostic criteria
   ➡Diagnosis of PBC is established if there is no extrahepatic biliary obstruction, no comorbidity
   affecting the liver and ≥ 2 of the following are present

- ALP ≥ 1.5x upper limit of normal
- Presence of AMA at a titer of 1:40 or higher
- Histological evidence of PBC
  - Non-suppurative destructive cholangitis
  - Destruction of interlobular bile ducts

2. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Jaundice
  - Typically a late manifestation of disease
- Hyperpigmentation
  - Result of melanin deposition instead of jaundice
- Xanthoma and xanthelasma
  - Result of hyperlipidemia
    ➡Abdominal examination
- Hepatomegaly
  - Becomes more common as PBC progresses
- Splenomegaly
  - Becomes more common as PBC progresses
  - Incidence appears to be decreasing probably because PBC is diagnosed in earlier
    stages than in the past

534

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Pancytopenia
  - Patients with PBC may have iron deficiency anemia due to GI blood loss related to portal hypertension
  - Patients with liver cirrhosis may develop leukopenia and thrombocytopenia
    ➡ Lipid profile
- Serum lipids may be strikingly elevated in PBC
- Patients with early PBC often have mild elevations in LDL and VLDL and striking elevations in HDL
  - Increase in HDL explains why patients with PBC despite with striking hypercholesterolemia do not appear to be at increased risk of death from atherosclerosis
    ➡ LFT
- →/↑ AST and ALT
  - Serum aminotransferases may be normal or slightly elevated
- ↑ ALP and GGT
  - ALP is almost always elevated often to striking levels and is of hepatic origin
- → /↑ Bilirubin
  - Normal in the early course of disease but becomes elevated as the disease progresses
  - Conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin are both increased
  - Elevated serum bilirubin is a poor prognostic sign
- Hypoalbuminemia
  - In patients who have developed liver cirrhosis
    ➡Anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA)
- Serological hallmark of PBC and 95% of patients are **+ve** for AMA
- AMA M2 is particularly diagnostic
  ➡ Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)
- Occurs in 70% of patients
- Two immunofluorescence patterns are considered PBC-specific including the multiple nuclear dots pattern and rim-like or membranous pattern
- Clinical significance of ANA in PBC
  - Presence of ANA can cause confusion with autoimmune hepatitis or overlap syndrome (PBC plus autoimmune hepatitis)
  - Presence of ANA is associated with more rapid progression of disease and a poorer prognosis
    ➡ Liver biopsy
- Often **NOT** required to establish the diagnosis of PBC but can provide useful information with regard to staging and prognosis
- Indicated in patients if the diagnosis is in doubt, patient has evidence of autoimmune hepatitis or if patient is not responding optimally with ursodeoxycholic acid
- Histological findings in PBC is staged on a scale of 0-4
  - Stage 0: Normal liver
  - Stage 1: Inflammation and/or abnormal connective tissue confined to portal areas
  - Stage 2: Inflammation and/or fibrosis confined to portal and periportal areas
  - Stage 3: Bridging fibrosis
  - Stage 4: Cirrhosis

535

4. Radiological tests
   ➡ USG abdomen - Imaging to exclude extrahepatic biliary obstruction or space-occupying lesion in the liver
   ➡ Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) - Imaging to exclude extrahepatic biliary obstruction

V. Treatment

1. Dietary modification
   ➡ Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) - Symptomatic steatorrhea due to bile acid insufficiency can be partially corrected by restricting dietary fat - Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are added or used for cooking if caloric supplementation is required to maintain to body weight - MCT does not require bile acids for absorption to enterocytes and hence can be digested and absorbed into circulation despite low bile acid concentration - MCT is absorbed by diffusion and do not require micellar formation
   ➡ Vitamin A and D supplement - Vitamin A - Oral supplement to compensate for deficiency - Vitamin D - Prescribed to treat the hepatic osteodystrophy
2. Medical treatment
   ➡ Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) - Dosage = 13-15 mg/kg/day - 1st line therapy in treatment of PBC which affects biliary composition and flow by an unknown mechanism - Only treatment aimed at modifying the natural history of the disease and should be continued indefinitely once started - Clinical significance - Decreases pruritus and improves LFT (bilirubin/ ALP/ GGT) - Increases survival, delays progression to end-stage liver disease and delay liver transplantation - Adverse effects - GI upset is the most common including abdominal pain and diarrhea
   ➡ Obeticholic acid - Indicated in patients with an inadequate response to UDCA defined as ALP level > 2x upper limit of normal after 1 year of UDCA
3. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Liver transplantation - Indicated in patients with serum bilirubin > 6 mg/dL, decompensated liver cirrhosis or anticipated death within a year due to treatment-resistant ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, recurrent variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy or HCC

536

4. Management of complications
   ➡ Pruritus

- Cholestyramine
  - Pharmacological category = Resins
  - ↑ Excretion of bile acids in jejunum and ileum by chelating bile salts
  - Adverse effects include dyspepsia, bloating, diarrhea and constipation
- Rifampicin
  - Enzyme-inducing antibiotics
  - Improves pruritus in cholestasis but potentially hepatotoxic
- Naloxone/ Naltrexone/ Nalmefene - Opioid antagonist - Naloxone is given IV whereas naltrexone and nalmefene are given orally
  ➡Hepatic osteodystrophy (Osteopenia/ Osteoporosis/ Osteomalacia)
- Calcium and vitamin D supplementation
- Bisphosphonates
  - Example: Alendronate

VI. Complications

1. Usual complications for cirrhosis
   ➡Liver cirrhosis

- Non-specific symptoms including anorexia, weight loss, weakness and fatigue
- Signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation - Abdominal distension from ascites - Confusion from hepatic encephalopathy - Hematemesis from esophageal variceal bleeding
  ➡Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
- Patients with PBC and cirrhosis are at increased risk of HCC

2. Specific complications for PBC
   ➡ Pruritus
   ➡Hyperlipidemia

- Increased cholesterol level in PBC do not increase atherosclerotic risk
  - Majority are elevation of HDL and lipoprotein-X which are anti-atherogenic
- Treatment is not always needed and is indicated only if familial or other known risk factors are present
  ➡Steatorrhea (malabsorption of dietary fat) and vitamin deficiency
- Lipid malabsorption
  - Result of decreased biliary secretion of bile acids
- Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K deficiency - Vitamin A and D deficiency are more common requiring supplementation - Measurement of serum vitamin A and calcidiol is required
  ➡Hepatic osteodystrophy (Osteopenia/ Osteoporosis/ Osteomalacia)
- Metabolic bone disease includes osteopenia and osteoporosis or rarely osteomalacia
- Characteristics bone disorders in primary biliary cirrhosis which reflects the inhibitory effect of a retained toxin on the osteoblast which prevent it from functioning normally
  537

VII. **Prognosis**

1. Prognostic factors
   ➡Factors associated with a poorer prognosis

- Unresponsive to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)
- Presence of symptoms at the time of diagnosis
- Elevated ALP and bilirubin levels
- Advanced histological stage
- Presence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)

VIII. **Case study**
Case 1

A 50-year-old female secretary was admitted for consideration of liver transplantation. She was first found to
have abnormal liver enzymes 10 years ago and 2 years later developed pruritus. She was referred to a specialist
clinic where a liver biopsy was performed. She was told she had a relatively rare kind of liver cirrhosis,
involving the bile ducts and was started on daily oral medication, which was followed by some improvement of
her liver function and pruritus.

5 years ago, she started noticing progressive abdominal swelling, which was only partially controlled diuretics.
Her abdominal swelling became more severe over the last 2 years and required repeated hospital admission for
paracentesis and increasing doses of diuretics.

6 months ago, she became drowsy after celebrating her daughter's marriage. She was admitted to hospital and
diagnosed to have "liver coma". Subsequently she was discharged home on a low protein diet as well as
laxatives. At an outpatient follow-up 2 months ago, the doctor told her that her liver function had deteriorated
over the years and she would greatly benefit from a liver transplantation. After discussing this option with her
family, the current admission was arranged to assess her for possible liver transplantation.

Physical examination revealed a moderately jaundiced lay, with liver palm and spider angioma. The liver was
palpable 6 cm below the right costal margin, with upper border at the 5th ICS. The liver span is 16 cm at the
right MCL and was firm, non-tender. It had a smooth surface and edge. The spleen was palpable 5 cm along its
longest axis and there was a moderate amount of ascites.

Q1: What is the basis for diagnosing primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)?

➡Diagnosis of PBC is suspected when

- LFT shows a cholestatic pattern (↑ ALP and GGT)
- USG shows no evidence of biliary disease or a SOL
  ➡Anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA)
- Over 90% of patients are positive for AMA
- AMA M2 is particularly diagnostic
  ➡ Liver biopsy
- Destruction of bile ducts by inflammatory cells
- Stage 0: Normal liver
- Stage 1: Inflammation and/or abnormal connective tissue confined to portal areas
- Stage 2: Inflammation and/or fibrosis confined to portal and periportal areas
- Stage 3: Bridging fibrosis
- Stage 4: Cirrhosis

Q2: What are the possible complications of PBC?
➡ Usual complications for cirrhosis

- Portal HT
- Ascites
- Hepatic encephalopathy
- Variceal bleeding
  ➡ Specific complications for PBC
- Pruritus
- Steatorrhea (↓ Bile production)
- Hepatic osteodystrophy
- ↓ Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, K
  Q3: Is there any specific drug treatment for PBC and how effective is it?
  ➡ Ursodeoxycholic acid
- Affects biliary composition and flow by unknown mechanism
- Results - Decreases pruritus - Improves liver function - Improves survival and delay liver transplantation
  Q4: How would you diagnose hepatic encephalopathy?
  ⬆⬆ Arterial ammonia
  ➡ Clinically presentation
- Drowsy to comatose
- Flapping tremor
- Fetor hepaticus
  Q5: What are the precipitating factors responsible for hepatic encephalopathy?
  ➡ Hepatic encephalopathy can occur spontaneously but may be provoked by following
- ⬆ Protein intake
- Alcoholism
- GI bleeding
  - ⬆ Protein content of blood in the gut
  - ⬇ Blood supply to an already cirrhotic liver
- Constipation
- Infection
  - Especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
- Shunting procedures
  - Including transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
- Over-diuresis
  - Dehydration and electrolyte disturbance
- Inappropriate paracentesis
  - Without adequate albumin infusion
- Drugs - Hypnotics
  539

Q6: How would you manage hepatic encephalopathy?
➡Medications

- (IV) Dextrose drip
  - Provide adequate calorie intake to prevent protein breakdown
- (Oral) Lactulose - As an enema with the aim of inducing bowel movements 2 - 4 times per day
  ➡Remarks
- No protein diet
- Any treatable precipitating factor should be identified and treated

Q7: What are the mechanisms of action and side effects of lactulose?
➡Mechanism

- Non-absorbable disaccharide
- Acts as an osmotic diarrheal agent
- Acted upon by lactobacilli in colon to form H2 and CO2
- Acidic pH buffers NH3 from gut-derived bacteria and in blood to form NH4+
  ➡Side effects
- Flatulence
- Dehydration (From excessive diarrhea)
- Aversion to sweet taste

Q8: What issues need consideration when contemplating liver transplantation?
➡Prioritization of patients for liver transplantation is usually based on Model for End-stage Liver
Disease (MELD)

- Takes into account patient's bilirubin and creatinine levels as well as INR
- For patients with non-biliary and non-alcoholic liver diseases an extra mark is added to score
  ➡ Age limit
- Patient should be younger than accepted age of transplantation
- Age limit that varies in different countries (usually 60 – 65 years old)
  ➡Clinical features
- Development of hepatic encephalopathy
- Uncontrollable ascites
- Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
- Variceal bleeding

Q9: In what way is the MELD score superior to the Childs-Pugh score?
➡MELD is superior because

- It has a continuous scale for all 3 parameters in the formula whereas the Childs-Pugh score is discontinuous
- It eliminates subjective elements (presence and degree of encephalopathy or ascites) and parameters that are often variable in different laboratories
  - Serum albumin
  - Prothrombin time

# Biliary cysts (Choledochal cyst)

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Biliary cysts are cystic dilatation that may occur in single or multiple throughout the biliary tree
   ➡Originally termed "_choledochal cyst_" due to their involvement of extrahepatic bile duct in 1959

- Expanded to include intrahepatic cysts in 1977
- Further refined to incorporate the presence of an abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ) in 2003
  ➡Associated with increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma (CC) especially patients with Type I and IV biliary cysts and those with APBJ

2. Classification of biliary cysts

[Image Description: Five images arranged horizontally, each depicting a different type of biliary cyst. The first image, labeled "Type I", shows a cystic dilation in the extrahepatic bile duct. The second image, "Type II", shows a diverticulum extending from the extrahepatic bile duct. The third image, "Type III", shows cystic dilation in the intraduodenal portion of the distal CBD. The fourth image, "Type IVa", shows multiple cysts in both intrahepatic and extrahepatic locations. The fifth image, "Type IVb", shows multiple cysts that are not in intrahepatic locations. The sixth image, "Type V", shows saccular dilations within the intrahepatic ducts. Each image shows the liver, gall bladder, bile ducts, and duodenum.]

541

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡Female predominance (M:F = 1:3-4)
   ➡Biliary cysts and abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ) are especially common in Asians
   ➡Majority of biliary cysts will present before the age of 10 years old

- Although frequently diagnosed in infancy or childhood, as many as one half of patients have reached adulthood when diagnosed

III. Etiology

1. Causes of biliary cysts
   ➡Biliary cysts can be congenital or acquired

- Congenital cysts may result from unequal proliferation of embryologic biliary epithelial cells before bile duct cannulation is complete
- Acquired cysts can occur rarely after cholecystectomy
  ➡Abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ) appears to appear in 70-90% of patients
- Pancreatic duct joining the CBD > 1 cm proximal to the ampulla of Vater
- Some biliary cysts may be the result of an APBJ which allows reflux of pancreatic juice into biliary tree with resultant damage to biliary epithelium and cyst formation

IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms (Classic triad = Jaundice + Abdominal pain + Abdominal mass)
   ➡ Jaundice
   ➡Abdominal pain
   ➡Abdominal mass
   ➡ Pruritus
   ➡ Fever
   ➡Nausea and vomiting
   ➡ Weight loss

V. **Diagnosis**

1. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials
   _ Leukocytosis if complicated by acute cholangitis
   ⇨LFT
   _ Serum liver tests are often normal in patients with biliary cysts
   _ Hyperbilirubinemia and cholestatic pattern may be noted
   ➡Serum amylase level
   _ Serum amylase level if complicated by acute pancreatitis

2. Radiological tests
   ➡USG abdomen
   _ Limitations include results being affected by patient's body habitus, the presence of bowel gas and limited visualization due to overlying structures
   _ Frequently misses Type III choledochal cysts
   ➡ Endoscopic USG
   _ Demonstrate extrahepatic biliary cysts and provide detailed images of the cyst wall and pancreaticobiliary junction and look for evidence of biliary obstruction
   _ NOT limited by body habitus, bowel gas or overlying structures
   ➡CT abdomen
   _ Detects all types of biliary cysts including determining intrahepatic disease in patients with Type IV and V
   _ Demonstrate continuity of cyst with biliary tree, examine relationship of cyst to surrounding structures and evaluate for presence of malignancy
   _ Biliary cysts should be differentiated from cysts that do NOT communicate with the biliary tree including pancreatic, mesenteric and hepatic cysts
   ⇨ MRCP
   _ Test of choice for diagnosing and evaluating biliary cysts
   _ Confirm that the cysts communicate with the biliary tree
   _ Does NOT expose patients to ionizing radiation and does not have risks of cholangitis and pancreatitis associated with ERCP

[Image: A small number "543" at the bottom right corner of the image.]

VI. **Treatment**

1. General principles
   ➡ Prophylactic cholecystectomy is indicated in patients with APBJ but no biliary cysts because of the increased risk of gallbladder cancer
   ➡ Treatment of choledochal cysts depends on cyst type

- Type I = Complete surgical excision + Roux-en-Y hepatojejunostomy
  Ο Reconstruction required to provide biliary drainage from the liver
  Ο Due to significant risk of malignancy and cyst excision can reduce complications such as recurrent cholangitis, cystolithiasis, choledocholithiasis and pancreatitis
  Ο Most frequent long-term complication of Roux-en-Y hepatojejunostomy is stenosis of biliary-enteric anastomosis leading to jaundice, cirrhosis or cholangitis
- Type II = Simple excision of cysts
  Ο Extensive resection reserved for cysts with complicated presentations including jaundice or malignancy in the cyst
- Type III = Endoscopic sphincterotomy
  • Endoscopic snare resection can be performed for Type IIIA cyst
  • Surgical or endoscopic resection can be performed for Type IIIB cyst
- Type IV = Complete surgical excision+ Roux-en-Y hepatojejunostomy
  Ο Patients with intrahepatic cysts (Type IVA) requires partial hepatectomy for excision of cyst and reconstruction with wide hilar Roux-en-Y hepatojejunostomy
  Ο Reconstruction required to provide biliary drainage from the liver
  • Due to significant risk of malignancy and cyst excision can reduce complications such as recurrent cholangitis, cystolithiasis, choledocholithiasis and pancreatitis
  Ο Most frequent long-term complication of Roux-en-Y hepatojejunostomy is stenosis of biliary-enteric anastomosis leading to jaundice, cirrhosis or cholangitis
- Type V = Supportive + Liver transplantation
  Ο Treatment is largely supportive and is aimed at dealing with problems such as recurrent cholangitis and sepsis
  Ο Caroli disease can be treated with hemihepatectomy when it is confined to one side of the lobe
  Ο Patients with bilateral disease may eventually need a liver transplantation

VII. **Complication**

1. Complications of biliary cysts
   ➡ Cholangiocarcinoma\* (CC)
   ➡ Acute cholangitis
   ➡ Acute and chronic pancreatitis
   ➡ Stone formation
   • Cystolithiasis (stone and sludge formation in cyst)
   • Hepatolithiasis
   • Cholelithiasis
   • Choledocholithiasis
   ➡ Intraperitoneal cyst rupture
   ➡ Secondary biliary cirrhosis (due to prolonged biliary obstruction and recurrent cholangitis)
   ➡ Bleeding (due to erosion of the cyst into adjacent vessels or due to portal hypertension)
   ➡ Gastric outlet or duodenal obstruction (due to obstruction of duodenal lumen)

Cholangiocarcinoma

I. Overview

1. General features
   [Illustration of the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. The liver is a large, reddish-brown organ. The gallbladder is a small, green sac attached to the liver. The common hepatic duct and the common bile duct are illustrated as greenish tubes connecting the liver and gallbladder to the duodenum. The ampulla of Vater, which is the opening where the bile duct enters the duodenum, is labeled. The intrahepatic region is highlighted in red, the perihilar region is highlighted in yellow, and the extrahepatic and distal extrahepatic regions are highlighted in blue.]

➡ Cholangiocarcinoma refers to bile duct cancer arise from epithelial cells of intrahepatic (10%),
perihilar (50%) and distal extrahepatic bile ducts (40%)

- Exclusive of gallbladder and ampulla of Vater
- Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma originates from
  - Small intrahepatic ducts (peripheral cholangiocarcinoma)
  - Large intrahepatic ducts proximal to bifurcation of left and right intrahepatic ducts
- Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
  - Divided into perihilar and distal segment with transition occurring at the point
    where CBD lies posterior to the duodenum distal to insertion of cystic duct into
    CBD

➡Metastatic

- Common mode of spread includes lymphatic spread
- Metastatic sties depend on type of cholangiocarcinoma
  - Intrahepatic: Peritoneum/ Lung/ Pleura
  - Perihilar: Liver/ Peritoneum/ Lung/ Brain/ Bone
  - Distal extrahepatic: Liver/ Peritoneum/ Lung

[Diagram showing Bismuth-Corlette classification of perihilar tumors. Six diagrams are arranged in two rows of three. Each diagram shows the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts, with variations in the extent and location of tumors (shaded white) affecting the bile ducts near the confluence.

- The first diagram shows Type I tumor; the tumor is located below the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts, specifically affecting the common bile duct.
- The second diagram shows Type II tumor; the tumor reaches the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts.
- The third diagram shows Type IIIa tumor; the tumor occludes the common hepatic and right hepatic ducts.
- The fourth diagram shows Type IIIb tumor; the tumor occludes the common hepatic and left hepatic ducts.
- The fifth diagram shows Type IV tumor; the tumor involves the confluence and both the right and left hepatic ducts.
- The sixth diagram also shows Type IV tumor; the tumors are multicentric.]

➡Bismuth-Corlette classification for perihilar tumour

- Type I: Tumour below the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts
- Type II: Tumour reaching the confluence
- Type IIIa: Tumour occluding common hepatic and right hepatic ducts
- Type IIIb: Tumour occluding common hepatic and left hepatic ducts
- Type IV: Tumour that involve the confluence and both the right and left hepatic duct/
  Tumour that are multicentric
- Bile duct tumours that involve common hepatic duct bifurcation are referred as Klatskin
  tumour regardless of whether they arise from intrahepatic or extrahepatic portion of
  biliary tree

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ Increasing incidence with age

- Male predominance
- Typical age of onset = 50 – 70 years
  - Earlier age of onset in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and
    choledochal cysts

546

### III. Etiology

1. Risk factors
   ➡Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)

- Strong association with cholangiocarcinoma especially perihilar disease
- Inflammatory disorder of biliary tree that leads to fibrosis and stricturing of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts
- Primary sclerosing cholangitis is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis

➡Cholelithiasis / Hepatolithiasis

- Cholelithiasis refers to gallstones
- Hepatolithiasis refers to chronic intrahepatic stone disease which leads to biliary stasis and recurrent pyogenic cholangitis

➡Fibrocystic liver disease (Choledochal cyst/ Caroli's disease/ Congenital hepatic fibrosis)

- Choledochal cysts are congenital cystic dilatation of bile ducts
- Caroli's disease is a variant of choledochal cyst that is characterized by multiple cystic dilations of intrahepatic biliary ducts
- Fibrocystic liver disease leads to cholangiocarcinoma by biliary stasis, chronic inflammation from reflux of pancreatic juice, abnormalities in bile salt transporter proteins resulting in unstable bile content or deconjugation of carcinogens previously conjugated in the liver

➡Chronic liver disease

- Viral hepatitis (HBV/ HCV)
- Liver cirrhosis
- Alcoholic liver disease

➡Parasitic infection

- Infection of liver flukes by consumption of undercooked fish which leads adult worms inhabiting and laying eggs in biliary system
  - Clonorchis sinensis
  - Opisthorchis viverrini
- Induction of chronic inflammatory state in proximal biliary tree leading to malignant transformation of the lining epithelium

➡Genetic disorders

- Lynch syndrome (Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer)
  - Autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutation in one of the several DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes
- Multiple biliary papillomatosis
  - Multiple adenomatous polyps of variable distribution and extent in intrahepatic bile ducts

➡ Others

- Obesity
- Diabetes mellitus
- Metabolic syndrome
- Thorotrast (thorium dioxide) exposure

IV. **Pathogenesis**

1. Histological features
   ➡ Majority of cholangiocarcinoma (> 90%) are adenocarcinoma and the remaining cases are
   squamous cell carcinoma
   ➡ Cholangiocarcinoma is characterized by slow growth, high rate of local invasion, mucin
   production and tendency to invade perineural sheath and spread along nerves
   ➡Adenocarcinoma is further divided into 3 types

- **Sclerosing:** Characterized by intense desmoplastic reaction with extensive fibrosis
- **Nodular:** Characterized by constricting annular lesion of bile duct
- **Papillary:** Characterized by bulky masses in CBD and cause biliary obstruction
  ➡Immunohistochemical stain is useful in differential diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma with other
  malignancy
- Cytokeratin-7 (CK7) positivity is consistent with biliary tract origin

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Jaundice

- **ONLY** in extrahepatic (perihilar/ distal) cholangiocarcinoma especially Klatskin tumour
  in which blockage of the bifurcation of left and right hepatic duct will cause jaundice in
  early stage
- Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma will **NOT** cause jaundice since bilirubin can be
  reabsorbed into blood and re-excreted through unaffected parts of liver
  ➡**Dark** urine and **pale** stools
- Extrahepatic cholestasis
  ➡ Pruritus
  ➡ RUQ pain
  ⇨ Fever
  ➡ Weight loss

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Choledocholithiasis
   ➡Viral hepatitis
   ➡Hepatocellular carcinoma
   ➡Malignant obstruction of biliary tract

- Pancreatic cancer
- Cancer of the ampulla of Vater
  ➡Intrahepatic cholestasis
- Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
- Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)

548

VI. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Jaundice
  ➡Abdominal examination
- Hepatomegaly
- Right upper quadrant tenderness
- Palpable gallbladder
  - Courvoisier's law: In painless jaundice if the gallbladder is palpable, it is unlikely to be due to gallstones and points towards biliary or pancreatic malignancy (lower end of CBD/ head of pancreas/ ampulla of Vater)

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials
   ➡Electrolyte profile

- Hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia
  - Hypercalcemia of malignancy associated with low PTH and vitamin D levels
    ➡ LFT
- ↑ AST and ALT
  - Transaminase level may initially be normal but will be elevated when chronic biliary obstruction leads to liver dysfunction
- ↑ ALP and GGT
  - Elevation of GGT can confirm excess ALP is of hepatobiliary origin
- ↑ Bilirubin
  - Elevated in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
  - Normal or slightly elevated in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
- ↑ PT/INR
  ➡Serum AFP
- Differentiate between intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and HCC
- Rare combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma tumour may have high levels of AFP
  ➡ Serum IgG4
- Evaluate for the possibility of IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis
  ➡Serum tumour markers
- ↑ CA 19-9
  - Established serum marker for diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma
  - Monitor effect of treatment and detect disease recurrence
  - Also elevated in cholestatic diseases such has cholangitis and gallstones or other cancer including gastric, pancreatic cancer and HCC
- ↑ CEA
  - May be elevated in cholangiocarcinoma but neither sensitive nor specific
  - Primarily a tumour marker for CRC but can be used in CC workup
  - Also elevated in GI diseases such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, diverticulitis and other cancer including lung, breast, gastric and colorectal cancer

549

3. Radiological tests
   ➡Ultrasound (USG) abdomen

- Initial imaging test obtained
- Confirm biliary ductal dilatation and exclude gallstones
- Localize site of obstruction
  - Perihilar lesion = Intrahepatic duct dilatation with normal extrahepatic duct
  - Distal extrahepatic lesion = Intrahepatic and extrahepatic duct dilatation
- Evaluate for vascular involvement with Duplex ultrasound
  - Encasement, compression or thrombosis of portal vein
  - Encasement or occlusion of hepatic artery
  - Invasion into portal vein or hepatic artery is important finding as it may indicates surgical unresectability
- Malignant obstruction is suggested by ductal dilatation (> 6 mm in adults) in the absence of stones
- Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma usually presents as a malignant-appearing mass lesion in a non-cirrhotic liver

➡Endoscopic ultrasound ± FNAC or brush cytology

- Indicated in patients with suspected distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
- Enable biopsy with FNA or brush cytology
- Assess local extent of primary tumour and status of regional LNs

➡Cholangiography (Non-invasive = MRCP; Invasive = ERCP/ PTC)

- Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
  - Indicated in patients with suspected perihilar or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
  - Differentiate between cholangiocarcinoma and HCC for intrahepatic lesions
  - Assessment for extra-regional LN involvement, invasion of critical adjacent structures and evidence of distant metastasis for tumour staging
  - Higher sensitivity than CT scan to detect extra-regional nodal disease such as metastasis to periaortic, pericaval or celiac artery LN and peritoneum
  - Superior to ERCP for assessing tumour anatomy and resectability
  - Does NOT require contrast injection into ductal system unlike in ERCP and PTC
- Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
  - Indicated in patients with suspected distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
  - Direct visualization of the area of abnormality
  - Superior to MRCP by enabling biopsy with FNA or brush cytology and therapeutic intervention using stent placement
  - Involves injection of contrast into bile duct and hence risk for ascending cholangitis in cases of impaired biliary drainage
- Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) - Largely replaced by MRCP and MDCT - Permit direct visualization of the area of abnormality, enable biopsy with FNA or brush cytology and therapeutic intervention using stent placement - Involves injection of contrast into bile duct and hence risk for ascending cholangitis in cases of impaired biliary drainage
  550

Contrast-enhanced multidetector-row helical triphasic CT scan

- Indicated in patients with suspected **perihilar** or **intrahepatic** cholangiocarcinoma
- Detect intrahepatic tumour, clarify level of biliary obstruction and presence of liver atrophy
- Assessment for extra-regional LN involvement, invasion of critical adjacent structures and evidence of distant metastasis for tumour staging
- CT-guided biopsy can be obtained if a mass lesion is seen with a risk of seeding the biopsy tract with malignant cells
- Lower sensitivity than MRI scan to detect extra-regional nodal disease such as metastasis to periaortic, pericaval or celiac artery LN and peritoneum

PET-CT scan

- PET scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) contrast
- Evaluate for occult distant metastasis that MRCP and MDCT are unable to detect

VII. Treatment

1. General approach
   Palliation for obstructive jaundice

- Surgical bypass
- Endoscopic or percutaneous transhepatic biliary stenting
  - Self-expanding metallic stent is usually used
  - Use of unilateral or bilateral stents are controversial for hilar obstruction
  - Endoscopic method is preferred due to less inconvenience without external drainage, lower risk of bile leaks and bleeding
  - Percutaneous method has a higher success rate of palliation of jaundice and lower risk of early cholangitis but external drainage is inconvenient
- Palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy
- Photodynamic therapy
  - Involves injection of IV porphyrin photosensitizer followed by the endoscopic application of light of a specific wavelength to the tumour bed

2. Medical treatment
   Chemotherapy

- Adjuvant chemotherapy has survival advantage for patients with resected cholangiocarcinoma
- Options for chemotherapy
  - Gemcitabine
  - Capecitabine
  - Leucovorin-modulated fluorouracil (FU)

551

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Indicators of unresectability

- Bilateral or multifocal intrahepatic disease
- Hepatic artery and portal vein invasion
- Extrahepatic adjacent organ invasion
- Distant metastasis
  ➡ Surgical approach according to location of tumour

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Cholecystitis

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Definition = Inflammation of gallbladder
   ➡**Acute** cholecystitis
   - Calculous cholecystitis (90-95%)
     - Obstruction of the cystic duct by an impacted gallstones
   - Acalculous cholecystitis
   - Tumour obstructing the cystic duct (<1%)
     ➡ **Chronic** cholecystitis
   - Associated with presence of gallstones
   - Chronic inflammatory cell infiltration of gallbladder seen on histopathology
   - Result of mechanical irritation or recurrent attacks of acute cholecystitis leading to fibrosis and thickening of gallbladder

2. Acalculous cholecystitis
   ➡ General features
   - **NOT** associated with presence of gallstone
   - Classically occurs in patients with other acute systemic diseases or critically-ill patients
     - Patients on TPN, extensive burns, sepsis, major operations, multiple trauma or prolonged illness with multi-organ dysfunction are at risk
   - Cause is unknown but gallbladder distension with bile stasis and ischemia has been implicated as causative factors
   - Clinical presentation is similar to acute calculous cholecystitis with fever, RUQ pain and leukocytosis
   - Same imaging modalities as acute calculous cholecystitis including USG and HIDA scan
   - Requires urgent intervention including systemic antibiotics with percutaneous USG/CT-guide cholecystostomy as the treatment of choice as they are usually unfit for surgery
     - Percutaneous cholecystostomy can be both diagnostic and therapeutic since infected gallbladder can be decompressed and the inciting stones can be extracted via the tube
     - Definitive treatment is interval cholecystectomy

553

II. Pathogenesis

1. Pathogenesis of cholecystitis
   ➡Cystic duct obstruction

- Obstruction of the cystic duct is the initiating event that leads to gallbladder distension, inflammation and edema of gallbladder wall
- Acute cholecystitis is an inflammatory process initially mediated by chemical irritant such as lysolecithin which is a mucosal toxin
  - Lysolecithin is a normal constituent in bile
  - Inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin released in response to gallbladder inflammation will further propagate the inflammation
    ➡Infection of biliary system
- Secondary bacterial contamination occurs in 15-30% of patients
- Infected bile by E. coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Enterococcus sp.

2. Histological appearance
   ➡Histological changes in acute cholecystitis

- Edematous due to inflammation
- Distended gallbladder with colorless mucoid fluid
  - Prolonged impaction of stone in cystic duct dilates gallbladder
  - Formation of mucocele with white bile (hydrops) due to absence of bile entry into gallbladder and absorption of all bilirubin within gallbladder

[Image Description: The image shows the number 554 in the bottom right corner of the page.]

III. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms

- Fever
- Anorexia
- Nausea and vomiting
- Abdominal pain
  - **Site**: RUQ or epigastrium
  - **Onset**: Sudden onset
  - **Character**: Steady
  - **Radiation**: Right shoulder (interscapular area) (**Boas sign**) or back
  - **Associated symptoms**: Fever, anorexia, nausea and vomiting
  - **Time course**: Prolonged for > 4 - 6 hours
  - **Exacerbating factors**: Movement
  - **Reliving factors**: Rest
    - Reluctant to move since the inflammatory process affects the parietal peritoneum
  - **Severity**: Severe

2. Differential diagnosis

- Biliary colic
  - Biliary colic is usually caused by gallbladder contraction in response to a fatty meal which presses a stone against gallbladder outlet or cystic duct opening
  - Results in increase in intra-gallbladder pressure and pain
  - **Differentiation from acute cholecystitis**
    - Biliary colic typically last for ≥ 30 mins, plateau within an hour and then subside and resolves completely < 6 hours as the gallbladder relaxes to permit stones to fall back from cystic duct
      - Pain in acute cholecystitis does **NOT** subside in contrast to biliary colic and may persist for several days
      - Pain in acute cholecystitis is usually more severe than uncomplicated biliary colic
    - Biliary colic pain is entirely visceral in origin without true gallbladder wall inflammation so peritoneal signs are absent
      - Peritoneal signs may be present in acute cholecystitis since the inflammatory process affects the parietal peritoneum
    - Biliary colic patients are usually afebrile without other associated symptoms such as fever and malaise and with normal laboratory studies
      - Patients with acute cholecystitis usually is febrile and complains of anorexia, nausea and vomiting
- Other differential diagnosis
  - Peptic ulcer disease (PUD)
  - Acute pancreatitis
  - Acute appendicitis
  - Acute hepatitis
  - Irritable bowel syndrome
  - Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction
  - Pneumonia
  - Pleuritis
  - Myocardial infarction (MI)

555

IV. Diagnosis

1. Diagnostic criteria (Tokyo criteria 2013)
   ➡Diagnosis for acute cholecystitis can be made by a combination of local and systemic signs of
   inflammation correlated with imaging findings
   ➡Diagnostic components

- A: Local signs of inflammation
  - Murphy's sign
  - RUQ mass/ pain/ tenderness
- B: Systemic signs of inflammation
  - Fever
  - Leukocytosis
  - Elevated CRP level
- C: Imaging findings
  - Imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis
    ➡Interpretation
- Suspected diagnosis = One item in A + One item in B
- Definite diagnosis = One time in A + One item in B + One time in C

2. History taking
   ➡ Diet history

- History of fatty food ingestion one hour or more before initial onset of pain

3. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Ill-appearance lying still on bed
- Cholecystitis is associated with true local parietal peritoneal inflammation that is
  aggravated by movements
- Jaundice
  - Severe jaundice is suggestive of cholangitis, CBD obstruction or obstruction of
    the bile ducts by severe pericholecystic inflammation or Mirizzi syndrome
    (common hepatic duct obstruction caused by an extrinsic compression from an
    impacted stone in the cystic duct or Hartmann's pouch of the gallbladder)
- Vital signs
  - Fever
  - Tachycardia
    ➡Abdominal examination
- Localized RUQ tenderness
- Guarding
- Rigidity
- Murphy's sign\*
  - Patient is asked to inspire deeply while the examiner palpates the area of the
    gallbladder fossa just beneath the liver edge
  - Deep inspiration causes the gallbladder to descend toward and press against the
    examining fingers
  - Leads to increased discomfort and the patient catching his or her breath in acute
    cholecystitis
    [Image of a page number in the bottom right corner of the page; the number is 556.]

4. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials - Leukocytosis - ↑ Number of band forms (left-shift) - High WBC count is suggestive of a complicated form of cholecystitis such as gangrenous cholecystitis, perforation or associated cholangitis
   ➡ LFT - Liver chemistry is usually **NORMAL** but a mild elevation of bilirubin, ALP, transaminases and amylase may be present - ↑ Bilirubin and ALP - NOT common since the biliary obstruction is limited to gallbladder - Presence of elevation should raise concern about complicating conditions such as cholangitis and choledocholithiasis

5. Radiological tests
   ➡ Abdominal USG - Presence of gallstones - Mobile and echogenic with acoustic shadowing - Demonstration of gallbladder abnormalities - Distended gallbladder - Gallbladder wall thickening > 3 mm (Normal: < 3 mm) - Double wall sign indicating edema - Pericholecystic fluid collections - +ve Sonographic Murphy's sign - Elicited during abdominal palpation with ultrasound transducer
   ➡ Radionuclide cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan) - Indicated if diagnosis remains unclear following abdominal USG or in atypical case - Biliary radionuclide scan using 99m Tc-hepatic 2,6-dimethyliminodiacetic acid (HIDA) enables visualization of biliary system - Radionuclide is concentrated and secreted by the liver allowing visualization of bile ducts and the gallbladder normally within 30 mins - Test depends on hepatic excretion of bile and therefore may not be useful in jaundiced patients - Failure of gallbladder to fill during cholescintigraphy after 4 hours indicates cystic duct obstruction usually from edema associated with acute cholecystitis or obstructing gallstones - Highly sensitive and specific but its expense and total study duration limit it from being the first imaging choice - Normal HIDA scan can exclude acute cholecystitis
   ➡ Magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRCP) - Evaluate intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts - Superior to USG in detecting stones in the cystic ducts
   ➡ CT abdomen - Usually unnecessary in diagnosis of acute cholecystitis but frequently performed to evaluate patients with acute abdominal pain - Demonstrate gallbladder wall edema associated with acute cholecystitis - Detects complications such as emphysematous cholecystitis or gallbladder perforation

557

V. Treatment

1. General principles
   ➡ Nil by mouth (NPO)
   ➡ Continuous monitoring of vitals
   ➡ Blood test including cross-match
2. Medical treatment
   ➡ IV fluids
   ➡ Analgesics

- Pain control with NSAIDs
  ➡ IV Antibiotics
- Acute cholecystitis is primarily an inflammatory process but secondary infection of gallbladder can occur as a result of cystic duct obstruction and bile stasis
- Treatment of pericholecystic abscess, emphysematous cholecystitis and biliary sepsis
- Empirical antibiotics should cover for gram -ve aerobes and anaerobes - Ampicillin-sulbactam/ Piperacillin-tazobactam/ Ticarcillin-clavulanate (OR) - Metronidazole + 3rd generation cephalosporin (e.g. Ceftriaxone) (OR) - Metronidazole + Fluoroquinolones (e.g. Ciprofloxacin/ Levofloxacin)
  558

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡Laparoscopic cholecystectomy

- Indication
  - Patient with emergent indications including progressive symptoms and signs or suspected gangrenous gallbladder or gallbladder perforation
- Severity grading for acute cholecystitis (Tokyo guidelines 2013)
  - Mild = Early LC
  - Moderate = Either early (OR) antibiotics followed by delayed LC
  - Severe = Antibiotics + Gallbladder drainage by percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by delayed LC

| Open                                             | Laparoscopic                                           | Early (within 48 – 72 hrs)                                                                                              | Delayed (Interval surgery in 6 – 10 weeks)                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pros** Serious complications ➡ Conversion rate | ➡↓ Pain ➡↓ Hospital stay ➡↑ Recovery ➡Better cosmetics | ➡↓ Pre-op morbidity and mortality ➡↓ Hospital stay ➡Avoid urgent operation ➡Avoid recurrent symptoms ➡Avoid readmission | ➡↓ Septic complications ➡↓ Serious complications ➡Easier dissection ➡Avoid misdiagnosis |

- Comparison between early VS delayed LC
  - Early cholecystectomy should **always** be recommended unless contraindicated
  - Early LC is associated with shorter hospital stays, earlier return to work, quicker recovery times and less wound infection
    - No significant differences in early VS delayed procedures with regards to mortality, conversion rate, bile duct injury and perioperative complications
  - Early LC is also easier to perform as local inflammation increases after 72 hours from initial onset of symptoms, making dissection less precise, increasing severity of surgical complications and making open conversion more likely
- Guidelines on timing of surgery
  - 2013 Tokyo Guidelines recommend surgery be performed within 72 hours of symptoms onset although not always practical
  - 2018 Tokyo Guidelines concluded that in patients for whom > 72 hours has passed since symptom onset, there are still benefits to perform cholecystectomy early and recommended early LC in low-risk patients with acute calculous cholecystitis regardless of how much time has passed since symptom onset
  - 2016 World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) recommend early LC as long as it is completed within 10 days of symptom onset
    - Symptoms > 10 days should not undergo early cholecystectomy unless disease progress and delayed surgery should be performed since it is a safer option to allow inflammation to subside

Overview of gallbladder drainage

- Indication
  - Severe acute cholecystitis (Grade III)
  - Late presentation > 72 hours after onset of symptoms
  - Failure of medical (antibiotic) therapy
  - Contraindicated to GA
- Percutaneous cholecystostomy\*
  - Decompresses and drains the distended, inflamed, hydropic or purulent gallbladder
  - Indicated in management of acute cholecystitis in frail patients who are not fit for general anesthesia
  - Placed surgically or percutaneously to drain the gallbladder
  - Catheter is inserted over a guidewire that has been passed through the abdominal wall, the liver and into the gallbladder
    - By passing the catheter through the live, the risk of bile leak around the catheter is minimized
- Endoscopic ultrasound-guided gallbladder drainage (EUS-GBD)
  - Transmural drainage utilizes EUS guidance to access the inflamed gallbladder with a needle puncture followed by dilation and stent placement over a guidewire
- Endoscopic transpapillary drainage by ERCP (ETGBD) - Transpapillary drainage utilizes ERCP to place a drainage catheter into gallbladder via the cystic duct - The other end of the catheter is either brought out through the nose (Nasobiliary drain (NB tube)) or left to drain internally into the duodenum - NB tube is pink in color with sideholes and is relatively contraindicated in confused patients
  [Image Description: The image shows a simple black-and-white icon resembling an arrow pointing to the right, followed by the words "Overview of gallbladder drainage." Below that is a bulleted list detailing different aspects and procedures related to gallbladder drainage. The list is structured with sub-bullets to provide more specific information about each point. The content covers indications for drainage, percutaneous cholecystostomy, and endoscopic methods like EUS-GBD and ERCP.]

VI. **Complication**

1. Complications
   ➡ **Gangrenous** cholecystitis - **MOST** common complication of cholecystitis - Presence of a sepsis-like picture suggests the diagnosis
   ➡ **Emphysematous** cholecystitis - Caused by secondary infection of the gallbladder wall with gas-forming organisms such as Clostridium perfringens - Abdominal crepitus adjacent to gallbladder may be detected - Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia may be present due to hemolysis induced by Clostridial infection
   ➡ **Gallbladder perforation** - Occurs after development of gangrene (perforation in ischemic areas) - Perforation is usually contained in the subhepatic space by the omentum and adjacent organs but free perforation, intrahepatic perforation and perforation into adjacent organs (duodenum and colon) can occur - Can be localized resulting in pericholecystic or intrahepatic abscess - Can be diffuse resulting in generalized peritonitis
   ➡ **Cholecystoenteric fistula** → **Gallstone ileus** - Occurs after perforation of gallbladder directly into duodenum and jejunum - Fistula formation is more often due to long-standing pressure necrosis from stones than to acute cholecystitis - Passage of gallstone through a cholecystoenteric fistula may lead to development of mechanical bowel obstruction usually in terminal ileum
   [Image Description: The image is a PDF page with text content describing complications related to gallbladder issues. It includes details about gangrenous cholecystitis, emphysematous cholecystitis, gallbladder perforation, and cholecystoenteric fistula leading to gallstone ileus.]

# HBP Diseases

## Gallbladder cancer

I. Overview

1. General features
   - Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is an uncommon but highly fatal malignancy
     - 25% at diagnosis are localized to gallbladder wall
     - 35% have regional nodal involvement or extension into adjacent liver
     - 40% have distant metastasis
   - Spread directly to adjacent structures such as liver, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, colon, omentum and abdominal wall
   - Spreads through lymphatics or venous drainage
     - Lymphatic flow drains first to the cystic duct node (Calot's), then pericholedochal and hilar nodes and finally the peripancreatic, duodenal, periportal, celiac and superior mesenteric artery nodes
       - Gallbladder wall differs from intestine histologically in that it lacks a submucosa and muscularis propria and lymphatics is present in subserosal layer only
       - Cancer invading but not growing though the muscularis layer have minimal risk of nodal disease
     - Venous drainage into adjacent liver usually segment IV and V where tumour invasion is common
   - Site of distant metastasis includes lung, pleura and peritoneum

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   - Female predominance (M:F = 1:2 – 3)

563

III. Etiology

1. Causes of gallbladder cancer
   ➡Gallstones\* (Cholelithiasis)

- 95% of patients with gallbladder carcinoma have gallstones which is one of the **strongest** risk factor for development of GBC
- Larger stones and symptomatic gallstones have a higher risk of developing cancer
  ➡ Gallbladder polyps
- Associated with an increased risk of cancer in polyps > 1 cm
  - Risk of malignancy in polyps < 1 cm is < 5%
  - Risk of malignancy in polyps 1.5 cm or higher is 46% and 70% respectively
  - Larger polyps are more likely to contain foci of invasive disease
- Malignant polyps tend to be sessile in nature and echogenic on USG
- Prophylactic cholecystectomy should be considered in polyps > 1 cm in size or meeting morphological criteria
- Different types of gallbladder polyps - _Benign_ lesions: - _Non-neoplastic:_ Cholesterolosis (Cholesterol polyp) (**60%**)/ Adenomyomatosis (Adenomyoma) (**25%**)/ Inflammatory polyp (**10%**) - _Neoplastic:_ Adenoma (**4%**)/ Leiomyoma/ Fibroma/ Lipoma - _Malignant_ lesions: Adenocarcinoma (**80%**)/ Squamous cell carcinoma/ Mucinous cystadenoma/ Adenoacanthoma - Histological subtypes of adenocarcinoma include papillary, nodular and tubular with papillary types associated with an overall favourable outcome
  ➡Porcelain gallbladder
- Uncommon manifestation of chronic cholecystitis that is characterized by intramural calcification of gallbladder wall
- Porcelain gallbladder which is characterized by calcification of gallbladder wall and is associated with gallstones and chronic gallbladder inflammation
- **ALL** porcelain gallbladder should be removed even if patients are asymptomatic - Absolute indication for cholecystectomy
  ➡Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
  ➡ Mirizzi syndrome
  ➡Choledochal cysts
  ➡Abnormal pancreaticobiliary tract
- Rare anatomical variation in which pancreatic duct drains into CBD resulting in a long common channel which predispose to reflux of pancreatic juice into biliary tree
- Represents failure of the embryological ducts to migrate fully into the duodenum
- Appears to increase risk of biliary and pancreatic malignancy with gallbladder cancer being the most common and therefore prophylactic cholecystectomy is recommended

564

IV. Pathogenesis

1. Anatomy of gallbladder
   [Diagram of the gallbladder and surrounding structures. The gallbladder is pear-shaped and located on the underside of the liver. Labels identify the fundus, body, neck, infundibulum (Hartmann's pouch), cystic duct, common hepatic duct, hepatic ducts (right and left), gland orifices, (common) bile duct, pancreatic duct, descending (2nd) part of duodenum, hepatopancreatic ampulla (of Vater), and major duodenal papilla (of Vater).]

➡Gallbladder is divided into distinct segment

- Fundus is the expanded end of gallbladder that projects away from the margin of liver and is anatomically associated with anterior abdominal wall and hepatic flexure
- Body is attached to liver (Segment IV and V) by loose connective tissue superiorly and the free margin abuts the duodenum and transverse colon inferiorly
- Neck extends from body to the cystic duct

➡Lymphovascular drainage

- Gallbladder is supplied by the cystic artery which is a branch of right hepatic artery
- Venous drainage parallels the course of arteries draining into cystic vein which drains into the gallbladder fossa directly into right haptic vein
- Sympathetic nerve supplying gallbladder derives from 9th thoracic segment and from the celiac plexus

➡Function of gallbladder

- Primary function is storage of bile which is produced by the liver and aids in the digestion of fat
- Released into duodenum in response to cholecystokinin (CCK) which is the major hormone for gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion

565

2. TNM staging for gallbladder cancer (2017)

**Primary tumour (T)**
TX ➡ Primary tumour cannot be assessed
T0 ➡ No evidence of primary tumour
Tis ➡ Carcinoma in-situ
T1 ➡ Tumour invades the lamina propria or muscular layer
T1a ➡ Tumour invades the lamina propria
T1b ➡ Tumour invades the muscular layer
T2 ➡ Tumour invades the perimuscular connective tissue on the peritoneal side without
involvement of the serosa (visceral peritoneum) (OR)
➡ Tumour invades the perimuscular connective tissues on the hepatic side without extension
into the liver
T2a ➡ Tumour invades the perimuscular connective tissue on the peritoneal side without
involvement of the serosa (visceral peritoneum)
T2b ➡ Tumour invades the perimuscular connective tissues on the hepatic side without extension
into the liver
T3 ➡ Tumour perforates the serosa (visceral peritoneum) and/or directly invades the liver and/or
one other adjacent organ or structure such as stomach, duodenum, colon, pancreas,
omentum or extrahepatic bile ducts
T4 ➡ Tumour invades the main portal vein or hepatic artery or invades two or more extrahepatic
organs or structures

**Regional lymph node (N)**
NX ➡ Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
N0 ➡ No regional lymph node metastasis
N1 ➡ Metastasis to 1-3 regional lymph nodes
N2 ➡ Metastasis to ≥ 4 regional lymph nodes

**Distant metastasis (M)**
M0 ➡ No distant metastasis
M1 ➡ Distant metastasis

**Staging system (Gastric and omental GIST)**
| Stage | | T | N | M |
| :---- | :-: | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0 | | Tis | N0 | M0 |
| I | | T1 | N0 | M0 |
| II | A | T2a | N0 | M0 |
| | B | T2b | N0 | M0 |
| III | A | T3 | N0 | M0 |
| | B | T1-3 | N1 | M0 |
| IV | A | T4 | N0-1 | M0 |
| | B | Any T | N2 | M0 |
| | | Any T | Any N | M1 |

[Image Description: a table showing the staging system for gastric and omental GIST cancers with TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) classifications and stages 0, I, II, III, and IV. The columns are labeled Stage, T, N, and M. T column indicates Tumor size and spread, N indicates regional lymph node involvement, and M indicates distant metastasis. The table provides detailed TNM classifications for each stage of the cancer, detailing tumor invasion and presence of metastasis.]

566

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Overview
   ➡ Patients with early invasive GBC are most often asymptomatic
   ➡ Patients who are symptomatic have non-specific symptoms that mimic and indistinguishable
   from cholelithiasis or cholecystitis
2. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Obstructive jaundice - One of the causes of malignant biliary obstruction (MBO) - Obstructive jaundice results either from direct invasion of biliary tree or from metastatic
   disease to the region of hepatoduodenal ligament
   ➡ RUQ pain
   ➡ Abdominal mass
   ➡ Constitutional symptoms - Anorexia and weight loss - Nausea and vomiting
   ➡ Metastatic symptoms - Ascites - Dyspnea/ Cough/ Hemoptysis

567

# Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡Courvoisier's law
   - Definition = "In painless jaundice if the gallbladder is palpable, it is unlikely to be due to gallstones" + Points towards malignant biliary obstruction
     - Gallstones develop over a chronic period of time causing chronic cholecystitis will lead to a gallbladder that is fibrosed and contracted and cannot be distended
     - Malignant biliary obstruction develops over an acute period of time and leads to dilatation of gallbladder from back pressure
     - Note that gallstones can sometimes be painless as well so this is not the reason why it is unlikely in painless jaundice
   - Exception
     - Double gallstones with one at CBD and another at cystic duct
       - Gallstones at CBD leads to obstructive jaundice
       - Gallstones at cystic duct leads to gallbladder dilatation due to formation of mucocele in a fibrotic gallbladder
     - Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC)
       - Essential pathology is in bile duct instead of the gallbladder
       - Obstruction of CBD without chronic cholecystitis and thus the gallbladder is not fibrosed and can be distended

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials
   - Leukocytosis for associated biliary sepsis
   - Thrombocytopenia when planning for invasive procedures such as ERCP
     ➡Clotting profile
   - Coagulopathy due to Vitamin K deficiency leading to from decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins due to obstructive jaundice
     ➡ LFT
   - ↑ Bilirubin level
   - ↑ ALP and GGT level (Cholestatic pattern)
     ➡Tumour markers
   - CEA and CA 19-9 are often elevated but are not diagnostically useful since they lack sensitivity and specificity
   - Serial assay after resection might aid in diagnosis of persistent or recurrent disease

568

3. Radiological tests
   ➡ USG abdomen

- Thickened irregular gallbladder wall > 3 mm
- Mass protruding into the gallbladder or a fixed mass in the gallbladder
- Dilated biliary tree
- Direct tumour infiltration into the liver
- Loss of interface between gallbladder and liver
- Presence of lymphadenopathy
  ➡ Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
- More accurate for imaging the gallbladder than transabdominal US
  ➡ CT thorax and abdomen with contrast
- Identify gallbladder mass, local invasion into adjacent organs, involvement of extraregional lymph nodes or peritoneal implants
- Contrast scan with arterial phase images to determine the anatomic course of hepatic artery relative to tumour which is necessary to determine resectability
- CT thorax detects distant metastasis to the lung and pleura
- Findings on CT consistent with gallbladder cancer - Focal or diffuse thickening of gallbladder wall - Polypoid mass protruding into the lumen or completely filling it - Nodal involvement - Direct liver infiltration - Presence of distant metastasis
  ➡ MRI abdomen
- Differentiate benign from malignant gallbladder lesions in equivocal cases
- Visualization of invasion into hepatoduodenal ligament, portal vein encasement and LN involvement
  ➡ ERCP/ MRCP
- Delineate the extent of biliary tree involvement
- Helpful in the presence of coexisting jaundice and in planning surgical procedures as they may indicate tumour growth in intrahepatic biliary ducts or in CBD
  ➡ PET scan
- Clinical utility of PET scan in gallbladder cancer is unclear and available data are insufficient to make conclusive recommendations
- Main utility of PET is in identifying otherwise radiographically occult advanced disease in order to avoid unnecessary surgery
  ➡ Staging laparoscopy
- Gallbladder cancer frequently involves regional LNs or extends directly to adjacent structures which may preclude curative resection but may **NOT** detectable by preoperative imaging such as CT or MRI scan
  - Mainly to confirm the absence of liver or peritoneal metastatic disease
- Diagnostic staging laparoscopic identifies metastatic disease or other findings that contraindicate tumour resection
  [Image of the number 569 at the bottom right of the page]

VII. Treatment

1. General principles
   ➡ Surgical approaches depending on staging

- Early stage disease (T1 - T2)
  - T1a = Simple cholecystectomy
  - T1b = Extended cholecystectomy
  - T2 = Extended cholecystectomy
- Locally advanced or node-positive disease (T3 – 4; Node-positive) - T3 = Extended cholecystectomy + En bloc removal of involved adjacent organ - T4 = Generally locally unresectable due to vascular invasion of hepatic artery or main portal vein or involvement of multiple adjacent extrahepatic organs
  ➡ Palliation treatment for obstructive jaundice or duodenal obstruction
- ERCP with endoprosthesis (endoscopic stenting)
- Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD)
- Palliative bypass

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Open VS laparoscopic

- Open approach for cholecystectomy is generally recommended since port site recurrences and late peritoneal metastasis associated with bile spillage are reported
- Open gallbladder surgery is usually performed with a right subcostal incision
- Additional exposure can be obtained with extension to the upper midline or the left subcostal region as a chevron incision
  ➡ ABSOLUTE contraindications for radical resection for gallbladder cancer (Resectability)
- Liver metastasis
- Peritoneal metastasis
- Malignant ascites
- Encasement or occlusion of major vessels by tumour (hepatic artery/ portal vein)
- Involvement of paraaortic, pericaval, SMA or celiac artery lymph nodes
  - Such involvement is considered distant rather than locoregional metastatic disease and therefore incurable
- Extensive involvement of the hepatoduodenal ligament by tumour either directly or through lymph node involvement
  ➡ Resection technique
- Surgical treatment of gallbladder cancer involves removal of gallbladder with a margin of liver + Regional LN dissection ± Extrahepatic bile duct resection
- Intraoperative frozen section of cystic duct is performed
  - _Positive_ = Regional LN dissection + Extrahepatic bile duct resection with reconstruction by Roux-en-Y hepatojejunostomy
  - _Negative_ = Regional LN dissection only

[Image Description: The image shows the number 570 at the bottom right corner of the page.]

➡Simple cholecystectomy

- Very early stage tumours including Tis and T1a can be cured with simple cholecystectomy alone
  ➡ Extended cholecystectomy
- Involves en bloc removal of gallbladder with a rim of liver at ≥ 2 cm adjacent to the gallbladder bed or a formal central liver resection (Segment IVb and V)
- Patients with tumours of the fundus or body of gallbladder, tumour is generally far enough from the inflow structures to liver to allow a negative margin resection with an ≥ 2 cm non-anatomical wedge resection of the gallbladder fossa or anatomic resection of segment IVb and B
- Minimal liver parenchymal resection necessary for clear margin is appropriate in most cases but more aggressive surgery may be necessary which includes resection of other segments of liver beyond that including in extended cholecystectomy if there is evidence of tumour infiltration
  ➡Bile duct resection
- Only performed when gross tumour extends into CBD or when a negative cystic duct margin cannot be obtained by intraoperative frozen section
- Routine bile duct resection with an attempt to achieve a more complete lymphadenectomy is NOT associated with survival benefit and has potential serious complications such as bile leak and anastomotic stricture with hepaticojejunostomy reconstruction
  ➡Lymph node dissection
- Proper LN dissection involves removing all LNs in the porta hepatis and along the hepatoduodenal ligaments (including those of the cystic duct, CBD, hepatic artery and portal vein), paraduodenal, peripancreatic and celiac LNs
- At least 6 lymph nodes should be removed for proper staging

VIII. **Prognosis**

1. **Prognosis of gallbladder cancer**
   ➡Majority of patients with gallbladder cancer have unresectable disease at the time of diagnosis
   ➡5-year survival for all patients with gallbladder cancer is < 5% with a medical survival of 6 months
   571

# HBP Diseases

## Mirizzi syndrome

I. Overview

1. General features
   - Mirizzi syndrome is defined as common hepatic duct obstruction caused by extrinsic compression from an impacted stone in the cystic duct or Hartmann's pouch of gallbladder
   - Presents with fever, jaundice and RUQ pain
   - Up to 1/3 of patients have acute cholecystitis on presentation and in rare cases acute pancreatitis
   - Association with gallbladder cancer
     - Recurrent inflammation and biliary stasis may predispose to both conditions
2. Classification of Mirizzi syndrome
   - Mirizzi syndrome is classified based on the presence and extent of cholecystobiliary fistula
     - Type I (11%): External compression of common hepatic duct due to a stone impacted at the neck or infundibulum of gallbladder or at cystic duct
       - NO fistula is present
     - Type II (41%): Fistula involves less than 1/3 of circumference of CBD
     - Type III (44%): Involvement between 1/3 and 2/3 of the circumference of CBD
     - Type IV (4%): Destruction of the entire wall of the CBD (Involvement > 2/3 of the circumference of CBD)

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology - Occurs in 0.05 – 4% of patients undergoing surgery for cholelithiasis - Approximately 50 – 77% of patients with Mirizzi syndrome are females which may in part be due to higher incidence of gallstones in women
   [Image Description: The page contains the words "HBP Diseases" at the top, followed by "Mirizzi syndrome" as a subtitle. The content is structured in a hierarchical format with main sections labeled "I. Overview" and "II. Epidemiology," each having numbered subsections. The text describes the characteristics, classification, and epidemiology of Mirizzi syndrome, including details about the obstruction, symptoms, fistula types, and patient demographics. Bullet points and indentation are used to organize information within each section.]

572

III. **Pathogenesis**

1. Anatomy of gallbladder

[Diagram of the gallbladder and related anatomy. The gallbladder is shown in green and is divided into the fundus, body, neck, and infundibulum (Hartmann's pouch). The cystic duct extends from the neck of the gallbladder. The hepatic ducts, labeled "Right" and "Left," merge to form the common hepatic duct. The common bile duct and pancreatic duct are also shown, merging into the hepatopancreatic ampulla of Vater, which drains into the major duodenal papilla of Vater. Gland orifices are visible near the junction of the hepatic ducts.]

➡ Gallbladder consists of neck, infundibulum, body and fundus

- Body extends from fundus into the tapered portion in the neck
- Neck usually forms a gentle curve and the convexity of which forms the infundibulum or Hartmann's pouch

2. Pathophysiology
   ➡ Large gallstones can become impacted in the cystic duct or in Hartmann's pouch
   ➡ Leads to common hepatic duct obstruction by mechanical obstruction of hepatic duct due to

- Proximity of cystic duct and CBD
- Secondary inflammation with frequent episodes of cholangitis
  ➡ Chronic inflammation may result in bile duct wall necrosis and erosion of anterior or lateral wall of CBD by impacted stones leading to cholecystobiliary (cholecystohepatic or cholecystocholedochal fistula)

IV. Etiology

1. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Choledocholithiasis
   ➡ Acute cholecystitis
   ➡ Liver abscess
   ➡ Infected choledochal cysts
   ➡ Biliary leaks
   ➡ Acute pancreatitis
   ➡ Acute appendicitis
   ➡ Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC)

573

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ⇨ Fever
   ➡Jaundice
   ➡ RUQ pain

VI. **Diagnosis**

1. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials
   • Leukocytosis in patients with concurrent acute cholecystitis, cholangitis or pancreatitis
   ➡ LFT \* ↑ ALP and bilirubin

2. Radiological tests
   ➡USG abdomen
   - USG usually reveals the presence of gallstones and a contracted gallbladder
   - Features suggestive of Mirizzi syndrome include
     _ Dilatation of biliary system above the level of gallbladder neck
     _ Presence of stone impacted in the gallbladder neck \* Abrupt change to a normal width of CBD below the level of stones
     ➡CT abdomen
   - Determine whether malignancy is present by demonstrating enlarged porta hepatis LNs or hepatic infiltration of metastasis
     ➡ MRCP
   - High sensitivity for Mirizzi syndrome
   - Determine extent of pericholecystic inflammation and aid in differentiation of Mirizzi syndrome from other gallbladder pathologies such as gallbladder cancer
   - T2-weighed MRCP images can differentiate between a neoplastic and inflammatory mass which may not be possible on abdominal USG or CT scan
     ➡ ERCP
   - Both diagnostic and therapeutic
   - Confirm the diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome and determine if cholecystobiliary fistula is present
   - Findings on cholangiography
     - Stone in the neck of gallbladder or cystic duct
     - Eccentric or excavating defect on lateral wall of CBD at the level of cystic duct or gallbladder neck
     - Cholecystobiliary fistula can be demonstrated by passage of contrast material from proximal dilated biliary channels into the gallbladder
   - Interventions performed \* Sphincterotomy and biliary stenting with endoprosthesis placement to allow temporary decompression of biliary tree
     [Image of a page with clinical and diagnosis information. Under Clinical manifestation there are Signs and symptoms listed like Fever, Jaundice, and RUQ pain. Under Diagnosis there are Biochemical tests with CBC with differentials and LFT, and Radiological tests with USG abdomen, CT abdomen, MRCP, and ERCP. Each test has findings and details listed]

VII. Treatment

1. General principles
   ➡ Surgery is the mainstay of therapy permitting removal of causal factors including the inflamed
   gallbladder and the impacted stones
   ➡ Laparoscopic management of Mirizzi syndrome can be difficult due to dense adhesions and
   edematous inflammatory tissue cause distortion of normal anatomy and increase the risk of
   biliary injury
   ➡Treatment approach is based on the presence and type of cholecystobiliary fistula

- Type I: Partial or total cholecystectomy (laparoscopic or open)
  - ECBD is typically **NOT** required
- Type II: Cholecystectomy plus closure of fistula either by suture repair with absorbable
  material (OR) T-tube placement (OR) Choledochoplasty with remnant gallbladder
- Type III: Cholecystectomy (OR) Bilioenteric anastomosis - Bilioenteric anastomosis includes choledochoduodenostomy,
  Choledochojejunostomy or cholecystoduodenostomy - Suture of the fistula is **NOT** required
- Type IV: Bilioenteric anastomosis - Typically choledochojejunostomy since the entire wall of CBD has been
  destroyed
  ➡ ECBD should be performed in all patients with cholecystobiliary fistula to rule out concomitant
  choledocholithiasis (CBD stones) unless it has been performed endoscopically

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Acute pancreatitis

I. Overview

1. General features
   - Inflammatory conditions of pancreas characterized by abdominal pain and elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes in blood

2. Classification of acute pancreatitis by severity
   - Mild
     - Absence of organ failure and local or systemic complications
   - Moderately severe
     - Transient organ failure resolving within 48 hours
     - Local or systemic complications without persistent organ failure > 48 hours
   - Severe
     - Persistent organ failure involving one or multiple organs

3. Scoring system for severity
   - **Background** = Since the associated mortality of fulminant acute pancreatitis approaches 40% and randomized studies have shown that early aggressive supportive care improves outcomes, attempts have been made to identify clinical parameters that predict patients at higher risk of developing severe outcomes
   - Ranson's criteria (11 criteria) (Mnemonic = GALAW-CHOBBS)
     - Most commonly utilized predictor of mortality associated with acute pancreatitis
     - Stratify severity and determine whether ICU care is needed
       - Score < 3: Mortality = 0 - 3% (Mild acute pancreatitis)
       - Score ≥ 3: Mortality = 11 - 15%
       - Score ≥ 6: Mortality = 40%
     - Limitation of this assessment tool is that a score cannot be calculated until 48 hours after admission

[Table summarizing clinical and laboratory parameters used to assess the severity of acute pancreatitis at admission (0 hours) and after 48 hours. The table has two columns: "0 hours (admission)" and "48 hours". The first column lists parameters such as Glucose level (> 11.1 mmol/L), Age (> 55), LDH (> 350 U/L), AST (> 250 U/L), and WBC count (> 16 x 109/L). The second column lists corresponding values for 48 hours: Ca2+ level (< 2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL)), Hematocrit (Fall by ≥ 10%), Oxygen (PaO2) (< 8 kPa (60 mmHg)), Base deficits (> 4 MEq/L), BUN (↑ by ≥ 1.8 mmol/L (5 mg/dL) despite fluids), and Sequestration of fluid (> 6000 mL).]

576

➡ APACHE II score (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Examination II Score) (14 criteria)

- Can be calculated at admission and updated daily to allow continual reassessment
- APACHE II score is somewhat cumbersome and difficult to calculate that limits its everyday use
- 14 Parameters for scoring
  - Age
  - Rectal temperature
  - Mean arterial pressure (MAP)
  - Heart rate (HR)
  - Respiratory rate (RR)
  - Glasgow coma scale
  - A-a gradient or PaO2
  - pH or HCO3
  - Hematocrit
  - WBC
  - Serum Na+ level
  - Serum K+ level
  - Creatinine
  - Chronic diagnosis
- Interpretation
  - Score < 8: Mortality = < 4%
  - Score ≥ 8: Mortality = 11 – 18% (Severe acute pancreatitis)

[Image Description: This is a page showing the parameters of APACHE II score, including the 14 parameters for scoring such as age, rectal temperature, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, Glasgow coma scale, A-a gradient or PaO2, pH or HCO3, Hematocrit, WBC, Serum Na+ level, Serum K+ level, Creatinine, and Chronic diagnosis. It also gives the interpretation of the score, with mortality rates for scores less than 8 and greater than or equal to 8.]

577

II. Etiology

1. Causes of acute pancreatitis
   ➡Gallstones\*

- Reflux of bile into pancreatic duct due to transient obstruction of ampulla during passage of gallstones
  ➡Alcoholism\*
- Increases synthesis of digestive and lysosomal enzymes by pancreatic acinar cells that are thought to be responsible for acute pancreatitis
  ➡Hypercalcemia
- Arises from hyperparathyroidism
- Formation and deposition of calcified stones intraductally in pancreatic duct
- Ca2+ activation of trypsinogen within pancreatic parenchyma
  ➡Hypertriglyceridemia
- High serum triglyceride concentration can precipitate attacks of acute pancreatitis
- Lipase is thought to liberate toxic fatty acids into the pancreatic microcirculation leading to microcirculatory impairment and ischemia
  ➡Post-ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography)
- Diagnosis of post-ERCP pancreatitis is generally made if hyperamylasemia is accompanied by persistent upper abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting
  ➡Drug-induced
- Steroids
- Diuretics (Furosemide/ Thiazide diuretics)
- Azathioprine
- Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors
- Sulphonamides (Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)
- Valproic acid
- Infections - Bacteria = Mycoplasma/ Legionella/ Leptospira - Virus = Mumps/Coxsackievirus B/HBV/EBV/CMV/VZV/HSV/HIV - Fungi = Aspergillus - Parasites = Ascaris/ Clonorchis sinensis/ Toxoplasmosis/ Cryptosporidium
  ➡ Tumours
- Pancreatic tumours
- Periampullary tumours
  ➡Autoimmune diseases
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
- Sjogren's syndrome
- Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
  578

III. **Pathogenesis**

1. Anatomy of pancreas

[Anatomical Illustration of the pancreas and surrounding structures. The image depicts the pancreas in the center, with labels pointing to its different parts: Head, Neck, Body, and Tail. The pancreas is surrounded by other organs and vessels, including the stomach, spleen, duodenum, inferior vena cava, hepatic portal vein, hepatic artery proper, common hepatic artery, celiac trunk, splenic artery, superior mesenteric artery and vein, inferior mesenteric vein, right kidney, left kidney, transverse colon, and jejunum. Several other structures are identified such as the portal triad, suprarenal gland, right free margin of lesser omentum, the attachment of transverse mesocolon, right and left colic flexures, middle colic artery and vein, uncinate process of pancreas, duodenojejunal flexure, and the root of mesentery.]

➡Characteristics of pancreas

- Retroperitoneal organ lying obliquely with the tail higher than the head
- 4 sections from right to left: Head/Uncinate → Neck → Body → Tail - Head of pancreas is cradled by the C-loop of duodenum - Neck of pancreas lies anterior to the mesenteric vessels and portal vein - Body of pancreas begins at the left border of SMV - Tail of pancreas sits close to the splenic hilum anterior to left adrenal gland
  ➡Vasculature of pancreas
- **Arterial** supply: Celiac trunk/ Superior mesenteric artery (SMA)
  - Head of pancreas
    - Superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (from GDA)
    - Inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (from SMA)
  - Tail of pancreas
    - Splenic artery branches
- **Venous** drainage
  - Superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal veins (into SMV)
  - Splenic veins (into portal vein)

579

2. Pathophysiology
   ➡Initial insult = Unregulated premature activation of pancreatic enzymes such as trypsin within
   pancreatic acinar cells

- Autodigestion of pancreatic tissues leading to peripancreatic and pancreatic necrosis
- Autodigestion extends beyond the pancreas into the retroperitoneum digesting
  peripancreatic tissues causing fat necrosis and erosion of blood vessels with hemorrhage
- Entry of enzymes into the bloodstream may cause respiratory and renal injury and other
  systemic effects
  ➡Systemic events
- NFKB-dependent inflammatory pathway regulates the synthesis of multiple cytokines and
  chemokines leading to recruitment of various inflammatory cells that magnify and
  propagate systemic inflammation
- Inflammatory cells lead to further acinar cell injury once recruited to pancreas and cause
  elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-a, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6 and other
  chemokines and anti-inflammatory factors

IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Fever
   ➡Abdominal pain

- Site: Epigastric pain but can be in RUQ or rarely LUQ
- Onset: Rapid onset (gallstones)/ Less abrupt (alcoholism)
- Character: Severe
- Radiation: Radiates to the back
- Associated symptoms: Nausea and vomiting
- Time course: Persists for several hours to days
- Relieving factors: Sitting up or leaning forward

2. Other symptoms of severe acute pancreatitis
   ➡ Dyspnea

- Diaphragmatic inflammation secondary to pancreatitis
- Pleural effusions
- Adult respiratory distress syndrome

3. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Peptic ulcer disease
   ➡ Choledocholithiasis/ Cholangitis/ Cholecystitis
   ➡ Hepatitis
   ➡Mesenteric ischemia
   ➡Intestinal obstruction
   ➡Myocardial infarction\*
   580

V. # Diagnosis

1. Diagnostic criteria
   ➡ Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis required 2/3 of the following

- Acute onset of persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back (Clinical)
- Elevation of serum amylase or lipase to ≥ 3x upper limit of normal (Biochemical)
- Characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging including transabdominal USG, contrast-enhanced CT and MRI (Radiological)

2. Physical examination
   ➡ General examination

- Xanthoma and xanthelasma
  - Hypertriglyceridemia pancreatitis
- Jaundice
  - Obstructive jaundice due to choledocholithiasis or edema of head of pancreas
- Vital signs
  - Fever
  - Tachypnea
  - Hypoxemia
  - Hypotension
    ➡ Abdominal examination
- Inspection
  - Abdominal distension
  - Pancreatic panniculitis: Tender red nodules frequently occur in distal extremities
  - Cullen's sign: Ecchymotic discoloration in periumbilical region indicating retroperitoneal bleeding in pancreatic necrosis
  - Grey Turner sign: Ecchymotic discoloration along the flank indicating retroperitoneal bleeding in pancreatic necrosis
- Palpation
  - Epigastric tenderness
  - Hepatosplenomegaly (alcoholic pancreatitis)
- Auscultation
  - Hypoactive bowel sounds (inflammation)

[Image of a page number at the bottom right corner of the page, which reads "581".]

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Leukocytosis
- ↑ Hematocrit
  - Haemoconcentration due to extravasation of intravascular fluid into 3rd spaces (sequestration of edematous fluid in retroperitoneum)
    ➡Serum inflammatory markers
- ↑ CRP levels
  ➡LFT
- ↑ Conjugated bilirubin
- ↑ AST, ALT and ALP in gallstone pancreatitis although normal values do not rule out biliary etiologies
  ⇨ RFT
- ↑ Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
  - Severe fluid loss may lead to prerenal azotemia with elevated creatinine and BUN
    ➡Serum BG level
- Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia
- Serum Ca2+ level
- Hypocalcemia as a result of complexing with fatty acids (saponification or fat necrosis) produced by activated lipases as well as hypoalbuminemia
  ➡ Serum and urine amylase level
- Serum amylase ≥ 3x upper limit of normal to diagnose acute pancreatitis
  - Rises within 6 - 12 hours and peaks at 24 hours after onset
  - Returns to normal within 3-5 days
  - Persistent elevation should raise clinical suspicion of complications such as pseudocyst formation
  - NO correlation between amylase level and severity
- Urine amylase level can be obtained for equivocal amylase result or delayed presentation
  - Rises within 24-48 hours and persists for up to 1 week even after serum amylase level have normalized
- Limitations (ABSENCE of elevation of serum amylase to 3x upper limit of normal)
  - Alcoholic pancreatitis due to inability of parenchyma to produce amylase
  - Hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis due to interference with the amylase detection assay
- FP results (other conditions with elevated serum amylase)
  - Intestinal diseases (Perforated bowel/ Intestinal obstruction/Bowel ischemia)/ Pancreatic disease (Pseudocyst/ Post-ERCP)/ Acute cholecystitis/ Alcoholism
- FN results
  - Delayed presentation (urinary amylase is required)
    ➡Serum lipase level
- Serum lipase ≥ 3x upper limit of normal to diagnose acute pancreatitis
- Clinical course
  - Rises within 4 - 8 hours and peaks at 24 hours after onset
  - Persists up to 2 weeks and returns to normal within 8 - 14 days
- Advantages
  - More sensitive marker in patients with alcoholic pancreatitis
  - Rises earlier and last longer than serum amylase and thus useful in patients with delayed presentation who present > 24 hours after onset of pain
- Other conditions with elevated serum amylase
  - Post-ERCP/Pancreatic tumours/ Acute cholecystitis

[Image Description: The image shows the bottom-right corner of the page, containing only the number 582.]

➡Cardiac markers ± ECG

- Troponin (TnI, TnT) to **exclude myocardial infarction (MI)** as a differential diagnosis of epigastric pain

4. Radiological tests
   ➡ USG abdomen

- Pancreas appears diffusely enlarged and hypoechoic on ultrasound
- Presence of gallstones in gallbladder or bile duct
- Peripancreatic fluid collection appears as anechoic collection
- Limitations
  - Distal (lower end) of CBD may be obscured by bowel gas
  - Cannot clearly delineate extra-pancreatic spread of pancreatic inflammation or identify necrosis within the pancreas
    ➡Abdominal X-ray
- Sentinel loop
  - Localized ileus of a segment of small intestine
- Colon cutoff sign
  - Reflects a paucity of air in the colon distal to splenic flexure
  - Due to functional spasm of descending colon secondary to pancreatic inflammation
- Ground-glass appearance
  - Indicates presence of acute peripancreatic fluid collection
    ➡CT abdomen with **contrast**
- Gold standard for the disease with Sn = 90% and Sp = 100%
- Contrast is **essential** to look to detect presence of pancreatic necrosis
  - Focal or diffuse enlargement of pancreas with heterogeneous contrast enhancement
  - Lack of enhancement with contrast in pancreatic necrosis
- Look for signs of biliary obstruction such as presence of stones and look for complications of pancreatitis
  - Note that CT changes may **NOT** occur within the first 24 hours of presentation
- Balthazar CT severity index (CTSI)
  - Prognostic scale based on CT findings including peripancreatic fluid collection and fat inflammation and extent of pancreatic necrosis
  - Score = Grade of pancreatitis (0–4) + Percentage of necrosis (0–6)
  - Score of 7–10 associated with morbidity of 92% and mortality of 17%

| Grade of pancreatitis                            | Points | Percentage of necrosis | Points |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :----: | :--------------------: | :----: |
| Normal pancreas                                  |   0    |           0%           |   0    |
| Focal or diffuse enlargement                     |   1    |         < 30%          |   2    |
| Pancreatic or peripancreatic inflammation        |   2    |         30–50%         |   4    |
| Single peripancreatic fluid collection           |   3    |         > 50%          |   6    |
| Multiple fluid collection or retroperitoneal air |   4    |                        |        |

➡MRI with or without contrast

- Higher sensitivity for diagnosis of early acute pancreatitis
- Better characterization of pancreatic and bile duct and complications of acute pancreatitis
- Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is comparable to ERCP for the detection of choledocholithiasis

583

VI. Treatment

1. General management
   ➡IV fluid resuscitation

- Establish 2 large bore (16 Gauge) peripheral IV cannula
- Lactated Ringer's solution may be superior to NS in reducing SIRS
- Aim to produce urine output of 0.5 mL/kg/hr in the absence of renal failure - 0.5 mL/kg/hr is the minimum indicating adequate renal perfusion and function - 1.0 mL/kg/hr indicates optimal renal perfusion and function with good hydration
  ➡O2 supplementation
- Pulse oximetry and ABG monitoring are usually necessary to assess oxygenation and acid-base status
  ➡Correction of electrolyte and glucose abnormalities
  ➡Foley catheter with Q1H monitoring
  ➡NPO only if necessary
- Nil by mouth (NPO) till nausea and vomiting settle
- Nasogastric suction if ileus or protracted vomiting
- Nasogastric decompression to decrease neurohormonal stimulation of pancreatic secretion
  ➡ Nutritional support
- Enteral route is preferred to parenteral route
  - NO longer acceptable to "rest the pancreas" by avoiding enteral nutrition
  - Early enteral feeding is associated with lower rates of infection, surgical intervention and length of stay
  - Delay in enteral feeding may contribute to the development of intestinal ileus and feeding intolerance
  - Nasogastric or nasojejunal feeding are both safe and effective
    - Enteral feeding can be introduced through a NG tube and increased in stepwise fashion over 2 - 3 days and NJ tube can be attempted if there is evidence of feeding intolerance
- Parenteral nutrition
  - Should only be considered only in enteral route is not available, not tolerated or caloric requirements cannot be met with the enteral route
- Recommended nutrient requirement in severe acute pancreatitis
  - Energy = 25-35 kcal/kg/day
  - Protein = 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day
  - Carbohydrates = 3-6 g/kg/day
  - Lipids = 2 g/kg/day

584

2. Medical treatment
   ➡Analgesics for pain control

- Mild pain can be managed with NSAIDs and more severe pain is managed with opioid analgesics
- Morphine should be **AVOIDED** due to its potential to cause sphincter of Oddi spasm
  ➡Antibiotics
- Prophylactic antibiotics are generally **NOT** recommended but may be considered in patients with pancreatic necrosis of > 30% involvement by CT
  - Imipenem\* or meropenem should be given to target against enteric organisms
  - Antibiotics that are known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis should be used including carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and metronidazole
- Indications
  - Biliary sepsis
  - Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
  - Increased CRP with other evidence supporting possibility of infection

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)

- Indications for ERCP
  - Patients with jaundice, acute cholangitis or evidence of persistent CBD stones leading to biliary pancreatitis
    - Arrange within 24 – 72 hours after admission for endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction
  - Patients with no identifiable cause to rule out CBD stones, strictures or neoplasms
  - Patients with suspected pancreatic ductal disruption such as in traumatic pancreatitis
- Contraindicated in gastric or bowel obstruction, altered anatomy in post-surgical state (e.g. gastrectomy)
  ➡Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD)
- Decompress and drain the biliary system in biliary (gallstones) pancreatitis
- Indicated in patients who are unable to perform ERCP
  ➡Exploration of common bile duct (ECBD)
- Open surgical drainage which is rarely perform nowadays

585

VII. **Complication**

1. Local complications
   ➡ Peripancreatic fluid collection (APFC)
   - Early complication developing < 4 weeks after onset of pancreatitis
   - Do not have a well-defined wall and usually remains asymptomatic and resolve spontaneously without the need for drainage
     ➡ Pancreatic pseudocyst
   - Late complication developing > 4 weeks after onset of pancreatitis
   - Encapsulated collection of fluid with a well-defined inflammatory wall (without epithelial cells) usually outside the pancreas with minimal or no necrosis
   - Occurs commonly after acute pancreatitis and pancreatic trauma
     ➡ Pancreatic necrosis (Necrotizing pancreatitis)
   - Necrotizing pancreatitis refers to inflammation associated with pancreatic parenchymal necrosis or peripancreatic necrosis
   - Infected pancreatic necrosis occurs in 5 – 10% of cases
     - Both ANC and WON can both be infected
     - CT scan cannot determine whether pancreatic necrosis is infected but gas in the areas of necrosis is suggestive
     - FNA is the gold standard for diagnosing infected pancreatic necrosis but is rarely necessary since treatment is based on clinical status and blood culture
   - Acute necrotic collection (ANC)
     - Early complication developing < 4 weeks after onset of pancreatitis
     - Collection containing variable amounts of both fluid and necrosis associated with necrotizing pancreatitis with no defined wall
     - Necrosis can involve the pancreatic parenchyma or the peripancreatic tissues
   - Walled-off necrosis (WON)
     - Late complication developing > 4 weeks after onset of pancreatitis
     - Mature and encapsulated collection of pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis that has developed a well-defined inflammatory wall

[Image Description: The number 586 is at the bottom right of the page]

2. Peripancreatic vascular complication
   ➡Splanchnic venous thrombosis

- Splenic, portal or superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis due to close proximity to acute inflammatory process
- Can result in hepatic decompensation or compromise of bowel perfusion
- Treatment should be focus on the underlying pancreatitis as effective treatment may result in spontaneous resolution of thrombosis
  ➡Pseudoaneurysm
- Visceral pseudoaneurysm is a rare but serious complication
- Most common in patients with necrotising pancreatitis
- Commonly involved the gastroduodenal (GDA), left gastric and splenic arteries
- Rupture is a life-threatening emergency
- 3 Clinical features suggest the possibility of pseudoaneurysm
  - Unexplained GI bleeding
  - Drop in haemoglobin (Hb) or hematocrit
  - Sudden expansion of a pancreatic fluid collection
- Angiography is the first step in management and can be both diagnostic and therapeutic

3. Systemic complications
   ➡System-based complications

- **Respi:** Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- **CVS:** Coronary artery disease/ High-output heart failure
- **GI:** Paralytic ileus/ Abdominal compartment syndrome
- **Renal:** Acute kidney injury
- **Hematology:** Retroperitoneal bleeding
- **Endocrine:** Insulin deficiency leading to hyperglycemia

4. Organ failure
   ➡Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)

- Pancreatic inflammation results in activation of a cytokine cascade that manifests clinically as SIRS
- Organ failure may present as shock, acute respiratory failure and renal failure

587

VIII. Management of complications

1. Peripancreatic fluid collection (APFC)
   ➡Resolve spontaneously within 7 - 10 days without the need for drainage
2. Pancreatic pseudocyst and walled-off necrosis (WON)
   ➡Conservative treatment

- Radiological monitoring since mostly resolves by itself
- Consider internal drainage (endoscopic) if cyst > cm by 6 weeks
- Consider external drainage if cyst develop complications including bleeding, rupture,
  obstruction or infection
  ➡ Drainage
- Indications of drainage
  - Symptomatic patients
  - Rapidly enlarging pseudocysts
  - Systemic illness as a result of infected pseudocyst that does not improve with
    medical management
- Endoscopic treatment
  - Criteria for endoscopic drainage
    - Fluid collection has to be mature (i.e. well-defined wall with mostly liquid
      in content)
    - Wall of fluid collection is adherent to stomach or duodenum
    - Fluid collection has to be 6 cm in size
  - Transmural drainage
    - Access the cyst via creation of tract through the gastric (cystgastrostomy)
      or duodenal wall (cystduodenostomy) with subsequent balloon dilation and
      placement of stents
    - Indicated in draining walled-off necrosis (WON) to allow evacuation of
      solid debris
  - Transpapillary drainage
    - Place a pancreatic stent with or without pancreatic sphincterotomy to drain
      cysts that communicates with the pancreatic duct
- Percutaneous treatment
  - Percutaneous catheter drainage is largely replaced by endoscopic approach due to
    higher morbidity, longer hospital stays and long duration of indwelling drains
- Surgical treatment
  - Surgical debridement to excise all dead and devitalized pancreatic and
    peripancreatic tissue while preserving viable functioning pancreas
  - Indicated in infected pancreatic necrosis or symptomatic sterile necrosis

588

3. Infected necrosis (Acute necrotic collection (ANC) OR Walled-off necrosis (WON))
   ➡ Overview
   _ Antibiotics
   _ Empirical antibiotics that are known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis are used
   _ Choices of antibiotic therapy
   _ Carbapenem monotherapy (OR)
   _ Ceftazidime/ Cefepime/ Fluoroquinolone + Metronidazole
   _ Percutaneous catheter drainage or endoscopic drainage is used as first step to stabilize patients overall clinical status
   _ Drainage in this way "buys time" and allows the lesion becomes more walled off and safer to treat
   _ Primary percutaneous catheter drainage may be the only intervention required in 1/3 – 1/2 of patients
   _ Resection of necrosis by minimally-invasive or endoscopic means is performed as a second procedure 3 – 4 weeks later if necessary ("step-up approach")
   ➡ Necrosectomy (debridement of pancreatic necrosis)
   _ Surgical debridement is indicated in patients who fail to improve
   _ Either open or minimally-invasive approach
   _ Open = Laparotomy/ Retroperitoneal approach
   * **Minimally-invasive** = Endoscopic or percutaneous radiologic (*recent trend*)
   * Should be delayed to at least 3 – 4 weeks after onset of attack
   _ Allow sequestration and demarcation of the necrosis
   _ Reduce risk of bleeding, disseminated infection and collateral damage to adjacent organs by an intervention \* Continued conservative treatment allows a minimally invasive debridement to be performed at a later date to clear necrotic debris

4. Pseudoaneurysm
   ➡ Angiography is the definitive diagnostic test and has been used increasingly to manage pseudoaneurysms by embolization with radiological coils
   ➡ Pseudoaneurysms are an **ABSOLUTE** contraindication to endoscopic drainage unless arterial embolization is performed first \* Severe and fatal hemorrhage can occurring following endoscopic drainage in patients with an unsuspected pseudoaneurysm

[A white page with the number 589 in the bottom right corner.]

IX. Prevention

1. Management of underlying predisposing conditions
   ➡Treatment of underlying risk factors

- Hypertriglyceridemia
- Hypercalcemia
  ➡Gallstone pancreatitis
- Endos Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
  - ERCP should be performed early in the course within 24 hours of admission for
    patients with gallstone pancreatitis and cholangitis
  - Other indications include patient with CBD obstruction with visible stone on
    imaging, dilated CBD or increasing liver tests without cholangitis
  - ERCP is **NOT** indicated in the absence of CBD obstruction
  - LFT, MRCP or endoscopic USG should be performed to confirm stones in CBD if
    in doubt before proceeding to ERCP
- Cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography (IOC)
  - Should be performed after recovery in all patients with gallstone pancreatitis
  - Intraoperative cholangiography is needed to rule out persistent choledocholithiasis
  - Patients with mild pancreatitis cholecystectomy can be performed safely within a
    week recovery and in the same index hospitalization
  - Patients with severe necrotizing pancreatitis should have cholecystectomy delayed
    until active inflammation subsides and fluid collections resolve or stabilize
    (interval cholecystectomy)
  - If clinical suspicion of CBD stone is **high** → ERCP
  - If clinical suspicion of CBD stone is **moderate** → MRCP or EUS to exclude CBD
    stones before proceeding to cholecystectomy
  - If clinical suspicion of CBD stone is **low** → Cholecystectomy with intraoperative
    cholangiogram during the procedure
    [Image Description: The page number 590 is visible in the bottom right corner.]

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Differential diagnosis is broad as signs and symptoms for pancreatic cancer are very non-specific
   and therefore should be based upon whether the mass is cystic or solid on imaging

| Imaging | Category                       | Differential diagnosis                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cystic  | Inflammatory fluid collections | ➡ Acute peripancreatic fluid collections (APFC) ➡ Pancreatic pseudocysts ➡ Pancreatic necrosis - Acute necrotic collections (ANC) - Walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WON) |
|         | Non-neoplastic                 | ➡ True cyst ➡ Retention cyst ➡ Mucinous non-neoplastic cysts ➡ Lymphoepithelial cysts                                                                                    |
|         | Neoplastic                     | ➡ Serous cystic tumours ➡ Mucinous cystic neoplasms ➡ Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)                                                                     |
| Solid   | Non-neoplastic                 | ➡ Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm ➡ Focal chronic pancreatitis ➡ Autoimmune pancreatitis                                                                                  |

III. Clinical manifestation

1. Symptoms
   ➡Abdominal pain

- Site: Epigastric pain
- Onset: Insidious in onset
  - Acute onset can rarely develop as a result of acute pancreatitis due to tumour occlusion of the main pancreatic duct
- Character: Typical gnawing visceral quality
- Radiation: To the sides and to the back
  - Severe back pain should raise suspicion for a tumour arising in the body or tail of pancreas
- Associated symptoms: Jaundice/ Weight loss
- Time course: Present for 1-2 months at time of presentation
- Exacerbating factors: Eating/ Lying supine/ Nighttime
- Relieving factors: Curled or fetal position
  ➡ Obstructive jaundice
- Common in pancreatic head tumours and occurs in the later course for tumours in pancreatic body or tail
- Occurs due to obstruction of CBD by a mass of pancreatic head causing hyperbilirubinemia or secondary to a liver metastasis
  ➡ Dark urine
- Inefficient hepatic clearance of the reabsorbed urobilinogen through bile
- ↑ Urinary excretion of urobilinogen
  ➡Pale stools
- ↓ Deconjugation of conjugated bilirubin by bacterial enzymes (β-glucuronidase) into urobilinogens in the colon \* Urobilinogen is colorless but turns orange-yellow when oxidized to urobilin
  ➡ Pruritus
  ➡Steatorrhea
- Common only in pancreatic head tumours
- Loss of ability of pancreas to secrete fat-digesting enzymes
- Blockage of main pancreatic duct
  ➡ Anorexia and weight loss
  ➡Nausea and vomiting
- Constitutional symptoms or a result of gastric outlet obstruction of CA head of pancreas
  ➡Fatigue and weakness

2. Signs and symptoms of metastasis
   ➡ Ascites
   ➡Abdominal mass
   ➡Dyspnea and cough
   ➡ Bone pain
   ➡Left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (Virchow's node)
   ➡Palpable periumbilical mass (Sister Mary Joseph's node)

593

3. Paraneoplastic syndrome
   ➡New-onset DM\*
   ➡Migratory superficial thrombophlebitis (Trousseau's syndrome)

- Unexplained superficial thrombophlebitis which may be migratory is present and reflects hypercoagulable state that frequently accompanies pancreatic cancer
- Due to tumour-elaborated procoagulants and platelet aggregating factors
- ↑ Risk of arterial and venous thromboembolic events
  ➡Pancreatic panniculitis
- Erythematous subcutaneous areas of nodular fat necrosis typically located on legs (pancreatic panniculitis)
  - Particularly in patients with the acinar cell variant of pancreatic cancer
  - Initiated by autodigestion of subcutaneous fat secondary to systemic spillage of excess digestive pancreatic enzymes

[Image Description: The image is of a table describing staging systems and primary tumors in the context of cancer pathology. The table is divided into several sections. The first section describes the primary tumor (T) categories, ranging from TX to T4, with descriptions of each category, such as primary tumor cannot be assessed for TX, and descriptions of tumor size for the other T categories. The second section describes the regional lymph node (N) categories, ranging from NX to N2, with descriptions of each category, such as regional lymph node cannot be assessed for NX and descriptions of metastasis status for the other N categories. The third section describes the distant metastasis (M) categories, with M0 indicating no distant metastasis and M1 indicating distant metastasis. The final section of the table outlines the staging system, linking specific combinations of T, N, and M categories to overall stages of cancer (0, I, II, III, IV). Each stage corresponds to a combination of T, N, and M categories, defining the extent of cancer spread. The table uses arrows to indicate what each level refers to in more detail.]

V. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Jaundice
- Cachexia
- Lymphadenopathy
  ➡Abdominal examination
- Scratch marks
- Sister Mary Joseph's nodules
- Hepatomegaly
- Epigastric mass
- Ascites
- Courvoisier's law
  - Painless jaundice with palpable gallbladder points towards malignant biliary obstruction (MBO)

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Anemia
  ➡Clotting profile
- Coagulopathy due to vitamin K deficiency with long-standing biliary obstruction
  ➡ LFT - ↑ ALP level - Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia - Assess nutritional status with albumin
  ➡ RFT - Hyponatremia and hypokalemia secondary to vomiting
  ➡Serum BG level - Assess for presence of DM - DM is hypothesized to be a cause as well as consequence of pancreatic cancer - New onset of DM in older adult should prompt consideration for screening for early diagnosis of a potential pancreatic cancer
  ➡Serum amylase and lipase - Evaluation of acute pancreatitis in patients with epigastric pain
  ➡CA 19-9 level - **NOT** sensitive and **NOT** specific to allow early diagnosis of CA pancreas - Elevated in 75% of patients with CA pancreas - Used as prognostic markers and as indicator of disease activity in patients with initially elevated levels - Serial monitoring of CA 19-9 is useful to follow patients after potentially curative surgery or receiving chemotherapy to predict recurrence and long-term prognosis - Requires the presence of the Lewis blood group antigen to be expressed - Other causes of elevated CA 19-9 level - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) - Biliary cancer (gallbladder, cholangiocarcinoma, ampullary cancer) - Gastric cancer - Colorectal cancer (CRC) - Ovarian tumour

596

3. Radiological tests
   ➡Ultrasound (USG)

- Transabdominal ultrasound is the initial imaging modality for patients with suspected pancreatic cancer
  - High sensitivity for detecting biliary tract dilation, establishing the level of obstruction and to detect pancreatic mass except for small tumours < 3 cm
- Endoscopic ultrasound may be used to guide biopsy of pancreatic mass if histological confirmation is required
  - Able to make up smaller pancreatic tumours
- Typical findings on USG - Focal hypoechoic hypovascular solid mass with irregular margins - Dilatation of common bile duct
  ➡Triphasic CT scan of abdomen (CT scan of pancreatic protocol)\*
- Current diagnostic and staging test of choice is a multidetector, dynamic, thin-sliced (≤ 3 mm), contrast-enhanced CT scan
- Assess local and regional disease extent which determines resectability as well as evaluate for possible distant metastasis
  - Triphasic refers to arterial, venous (pancreatic) and portal venous phase
    - Arterial phase: Enhancement of celiac axis, SMA and peripancreatic arteries
    - Venous (pancreatic) phase: Attenuation difference between tumour and normal pancreas which increase lesion conspicuity
    - Portal venous phase: Enhancement of SMV, splenic and portal veins
- Assessment of distant metastasis
  - Distant metastasis in liver, peritoneum, omentum or any extra-abdominal sites also leads to unresectability
- Typical findings of CT scan
  - Ill-defined hypoattenuating mass within the pancreas\*
  - Dilatation of pancreatic ducts and common bile ducts\* ("Double-duct sign")
  - Pancreatic duct cutoff
  - Parenchymal atrophy
  - Contour abnormalities

597

➡Endoscopic USG + FNAC/ Biopsy

- Detects small pancreatic mass that could be missed by CT scan and is commonly used when there is high suspicion of CA pancreas but no mass is identified by CT scan
- EUS-guided FNAC or biopsy is preferred over USG or CT-guided percutaneous biopsy for diagnosis
  - Less risk of tumour seedling
- **NOT** required when suspicion of CA pancreas is high
  - Once pancreatic cancer is suspected on initial imaging studies a staging evaluation to establish disease extent and resectability is the next step rather than biopsy
  - Patients who are fit for surgery with a potentially resectable CA pancreas after staging evaluation can proceed directly to surgery without preoperative biopsy
  - Resection provides therapeutic benefits and substantially delaying surgery can set back commencement of effective treatment
- Indicated if there is local evidence of unresectability on staging studies, if patient is unfit for surgery, if neoadjuvant treatment is being contemplated and require definitive diagnosis or an alternative diagnosis has to be excluded
- Preoperative biopsy is also recommended if a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis or autoimmune pancreatitis is suspected on history and imaging since they can closely mimic pancreatic cancer - Diffuse pancreatic ductal changes in chronic pancreatitis - Multifocal biliary strictures in autoimmune pancreatitis
  ➡Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
- Indicated if biliary decompression is required
  - **NOT** all patients with biliary obstruction from pancreatic cancer require decompression and stenting if pancreatic cancer is potentially resectable
  - Invasive procedure, expensive together with possible complications such as pancreatitis, bleeding and cholangitis makes ERCP evolve into a mainly therapeutic modality for patient who present with cholestasis due to tumour obstruction and require placement of biliary stent
- Highly sensitive tool for visualization of biliary tree and pancreatic ducts and provides opportunity to collect tissue samples by brush cytology or forceps biopsy
  ➡Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
- Superior in delineating the anatomy of biliary tree especially if the system is not obstructed and there are no therapeutic indications for ERCP
  ➡Diagnostic laparoscopy
- General exploration of peritoneal surfaces is carried out
- Preliminary laparoscopy is used in an attempt to avoid future laparotomy
- As the quality of CT has improved the value of diagnostic laparoscopy has decreased
- Indicated when there is a high suspicion of metastatic disease - Tumours located in body or tail - Large tumours > 4 cm - High CA 19-9 level - Equivocal findings of metastasis or ascites on CT scan
  ➡Imaging modalities to detect metastasis
- CXR/CT thorax: Lung metastasis
- USG/CT abdomen: Liver metastasis
- Bone scan: Bone metastasis
- Staging laparoscopy: Peritoneal metastasis

# VI. Treatment

1. General approach
   ➡Surgical treatment is the only potentially curative treatment
   - Only 15 – 20% of patients are surgical candidates for pancreatectomy because of late presentation of the disease
     ➡Palliative treatment (3 main indications of palliation)
   - Pain from celiac plexus infiltration
     - Narcotics such as morphine
     - Endoscopic USG/ CT-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (celiac plexus block)
   - Obstructive jaundice due to biliary obstruction
     - ERCP with endoprosthesis (endoscopic stenting)
     - Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD)
     - Hepaticojejunostomy/ Choledochojejunostomy (single bypass)
       - Choledochoduodenostomy is **NOT** advised because of the proximity of the duodenum to tumour
   - Duodenal obstruction/ Gastric outlet obstruction
     - Endoscopic duodenal wall stenting
     - Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement for decompression
     - - Gastrojejunostomy (double-bypass)

2. Medical treatment
   ➡Chemotherapy and radiotherapy
   - Treatment options
     - Gemcitabine (common)/ Erlotinib/ Capecitabine/ 5-FU
       - Gemcitabine results in symptomatic improvement, improved pain control and performance status and weight gain in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer
   - Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy
     - Downstage patients with borderline resectable disease
   - Adjuvant chemotherapy
     - Evidence suggests adjuvant therapy increases survival
     - There is a clear benefit to adjuvant therapy in CA pancreas but the choice between chemoradiation and chemotherapy is less clear

[Image Description: This image is a PDF page containing information about PET-CT and MRI scans, as well as treatment options for a medical condition. The section on PET-CT scans discusses data insufficiency and distinguishing chronic pancreatitis. The section on MRI scans states that there is no significant diagnostic advantage over triple-phase MDCT.The "Treatment" section is divided into "General approach" and "Medical treatment". The "General approach" section covers surgical and palliative treatments, including specific procedures and medications. The "Medical treatment" section focuses on chemotherapy and radiotherapy, including different treatment options and their effects. The page concludes with additional information on neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy.]

➡PET-CT scan - Data remains insufficient to conclude that PET or PET-CT scan provides useful information above that provided by contrast-enhanced CT - Distinguish chronic pancreatitis from CA pancreas
➡X MRI scan - No evidence that MRI offers a significant diagnostic advantage over triple-phase MDCT - MRI currently provides essentially the same information as CT scan

3. Surgical treatment
   [Diagram illustrating two surgical procedures: on the left, an "End-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy," and on the right, an "End-to-end pancreaticojejunostomy." Both diagrams depict the liver, pancreas, and small intestine. The pancreas is connected to the jejunum in different ways in each diagram. The caption below the diagrams reads "Whipple's operation (pylorus-preserving)"]

➡Assessment of resectability

- Locally resectable disease
  - Absence of distant metastasis
  - No radiographic evidence of SMV and portal vein abutment, distortion, tumour thrombus or venous encasement
  - Clear fat planes around celiac artery, hepatic artery or SMA
- Borderline resectable disease
  - Tumour abutment < 180° of celiac artery, hepatic artery or SMA
  - Tumour abutment < 180° of portal vein or SMV with or without impingement and narrowing of the lumen
  - Tumour encasement ≥ 180° of portal vein or SMV but without encasement of nearby arteries
  - Short segment venous occlusion resulting from either tumour thrombus or encasement but with adequate vessels above and below site of malignancy to allow for safe resection and reconstruction
- Unresectable disease
  - Presence of distant metastasis
  - Tumour encasement ≥ 180° of celiac artery, hepatic artery or SMA
  - Major venous thrombosis of portal vein or SMV
    - Invasion of the portal vein or SMV not in itself a contraindication to resection as long as the veins are patent

➡Preoperative consideration

- Staging laparoscopy
  - Current imaging technique is accurate at predicting unresectable disease but fall short in predicting resectable disease due to limited sensitivity for small-volume metastatic diseases
  - Imaging modalities such as USG, CT and MRI can miss occult metastasis on the surface of liver and peritoneum
  - Performed in patients with high likelihood of occult metastatic disease such as tumour in body or tail, large primary tumours or high initial CA19-9 level
  - In case peritoneal deposits is found during staging laparoscopy the surgery should be aborted
    600

➡Preoperative biliary drainage

- Achieved either by ERCP with endoprosthesis (endoscopic stenting) or PTBD
- Target level: Serum bilirubin < 50 µmol/L
- Theoretically: Do NOT need to drain if no sepsis + early surgery can be offered within 1 - 2 weeks
  - Preoperative biliary drainage increases risk of serious complications even in expert hands but surgical-related complications are comparable even without drainage
- Practically (QMH): Drain ALL patients since QMH cannot offer early surgery
  - Whipple operation has to wait for 6-8 weeks and the chance of biliary sepsis will be very high without drainage while waiting for this period
- Advantages
  - Minimize the risk of developing cholangitis
  - Relieves jaundice and pruritus while preventing complications due to cholestasis
  - Allow time for neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced CA head of pancreas
- Disadvantages
  - Increase the number of interventions and associated costs
  - Increase risk of procedure-related complications including cholangitis, pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation or blocked stent
    ➡Whipple's operation (Pancreaticoduodenectomy)
- Conventional operation for cancer of the CA head of pancreas or uncinate process
- Performed through a midline incision from xiphoid to umbilicus or through a bilateral subcostal incision
- Whipple's operation involves removal of
  - Pancreatic head, duodenum, first 15 cm of jejunum, common bile duct, gallbladder and cystic duct, partial gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy
- Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD)
  - Modified versions of Whipple's operation
  - Preservation of gastric antrum, pylorus and proximal 3-6 cm of duodenum
  - Duodenum is the anastomosed to jejunum to restore GI continuity
  - Lower risk of morbidity with the following advantages
    - ↓Post-gastrectomy dumping
    - ↓ Marginal ulceration
    - ↓Bile reflux gastritis
    - Improves post-operative nutrition
- Gastrointestinal reconstruction (3 anastomosis required)
  - Pancreaticojejunostomy + Choledochojejunostomy/Hepaticojejunostomy + Gastrojejunostomy/ Duodenojejunostomy
  - Free end of jejunum is attached first to pancreas, next to bile duct and last to the stomach or duodenal remnant
  - Provides a drainage route for the remaining pancreas, bile duct and stomach

➡ Distal pancreatectomy ± splenectomy

- Procedure of choice for lesions of the body or tail is distal pancreatectomy
- Carcinoma of the body or tail of pancreas do not cause obstruction to the CBD and thus early diagnosis is rare with majority of confirmed case being locally advanced or metastatic at the time of presentation
- In rare patient who appears to have potentially resectable disease by CT scan, laparoscopic exploration should be performed first to rule out occult metastasis missed by CT scan before resection is attempted

VII. Prognosis

1. Complications
   ➡ Acute cholangitis
   ➡ Acute pancreatitis

2. Prognosis of pancreatic cancer
   ➡ Highly lethal malignancy

- 8% of CA pancreas are diagnosed when cancer is still localized to primary site
- 27% of CA pancreas are diagnosed when cancer has spread to regional LNs or beyond the primary site
- 53% of CA pancreas are diagnosed when cancer has already metastasis (majority)
  ➡ Poor prognosis in general even after a complete resection
- 5-year survival rate after pancreaticoduodenectomy for node -ve = 25 – 30%
- 5-year survival rate after pancreaticoduodenectomy for node +ve = 10%
  ➡ Median survival for unresectable locally advanced disease = 12 months
  ➡ Median survival for metastatic disease to liver = 6 months

# Gastrointestinal Disease

# Intestinal obstruction (IO)

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Intestinal obstruction is a common surgical emergency
   ➡ Small bowel obstruction is more common and is involved in 80% of case of mechanical IO
2. Classification of IO
   ➡ Anatomical classification

- Small bowel obstruction
- Large bowel obstruction
  ➡ Mechanical classification
- Refers to peristalsis that works against a mechanical obstruction
- Intra-luminal/ Intra-mural/Extra-mural
  ➡ Functional classification
- Refers to absence or inadequate peristalsis without mechanical obstruction
- Paralytic ileus
  - Failure of transmission of peristaltic waves secondary to neuromuscular failure in myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus and submucous (Meissner's) plexus
- Pseudo-obstruction
  - Obstruction in absence of mechanical cause or intra-abdominal disease
  - Associated with syndrome with underlying neuropathy or myopathy and a range of other factors

3. Types of obstruction
   ➡Closed-loop obstruction

- Segment of intestine is obstructed in two locations creating a segment with no proximal or distal outlet
- Presents with minimal abdominal distension since only a short segment of intestine is distended but can rapidly lead to complications such as ischemia, necrosis and perforation

[Image Description: This is an illustration of a single page of text, it begins with "Gastrointestinal Disease" and "Intestinal obstruction (IO)" at the top in bold, and the rest of the page contains various points describing the disease, its classifications and types of obstruction. The document also has a page number at the bottom right of the page, which reads '603'.]

II. Etiology

1. Overview of causes
   ➡ **MOST** common causes of small bowel obstruction is adhesions, malignancy and hernias
   ➡ **MOST** common causes of large bowel obstruction is malignancy and volvulus

[Image of a table describing the mechanical causes of bowel obstruction, broken down by intraluminal and intramural causes. For intraluminal causes, the table lists feces (with a sub-bullet of fecal impaction due to chronic constipation), gallstones (with sub-bullets detailing erosion into the small bowel, obstruction location, and pneumobilia presentation), and foreign bodies (with sub-bullets of food post-gastrectomy, trichobezoar, and phytobezoar). For intramural causes, the table lists infection (acute appendicitis and diverticulitis, intraabdominal abscess), malignancy (lymphoma, GIST, adenocarcinoma, metastatic disease), strictures (inflammatory, ischemic, radiation, and anastomotic), hematoma (traumatic intramural), intussusception (with notes on location and common causes in children and adults), and volvulus (sigmoid/cecal and twisting).]

604

Extra-mural
➡Bands and adhesions (40%)

- Causes of adhesions include prior surgery, infection such as tuberculous peritonitis and inflammation such as Crohn's disease and diverticulitis
- Any source of peritoneal irritation results in local fibrin production and produces adhesions between apposed surfaces
  ➡Hernia (10%)
- Abdominal wall and inguinal hernias are most commonly represented
- Incarcerate hernia are the leading cause of complications (e.g. ischemia, necrosis and perforation) related to bowel obstruction

Functional causes
Paralytic ileus
➡Post-operative ileus

- A degree of paralytic ileus is common after any abdominal procedure with a variable duration of 24-72 hours
  ➡Intraabdominal infection
- Intraabdominal sepsis can give rise to localized or generalized sepsis
- **Examples**: Intraabdominal abscess/ Peritonitis/ Pancreatitis
  ➡Reflex ileus
- Fracture of spine or ribs
- Retroperitoneal hemorrhage
  ➡Metabolic
- Hypokalemia
- Hypothyroidism
  ➡ Drug-induced
- Opiates
- Anti-cholinergics
  Pseudo-obstruction
  ➡ Small intestinal pseudo-obstruction
- Idiopathic
- Familial visceral myopathy
  ➡Large intestinal pseudo-obstruction
- Toxin megacolon
  - Characterized by total or segmental colonic dilatation with systemic toxicity
  - Occurs as a complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), infectious colitis, ischemic colitis, volvulus, diverticulitis and obstructive CA colon
  - Bloody diarrhea is the most common clinical presentation
  - Commonly associated with Clostridium difficile and patients usually has a history of antibiotic use
- Ogilvie's syndrome (Intestinal pseudo-obstruction) - Characterized by acute dilatation of colon in the absence of an anatomic lesion that obstruct the flow of intestinal content - Occurs in hospitalized patients in association with a severe illness or after surgery and in conjunction with a metabolic imbalance or administration of medications - Abdominal distension is the most common clinical presentation

2. Risk factors
   ➡Medical history

- Hernia
- Abdominal infection or inflammation
- Abdominal malignancy
- Previous intestinal obstruction
  ➡Surgical history
- Abdominal or pelvic surgery
  ➡ Drug history
- Previous abdominal irradiation
- Medications
  - Opiates
  - Anti-cholinergics (Anti-histamines/ Anti-spasmodic/ Anti-depressants/ Anti-psychotics)

III. Pathophysiology

1. Obstructive physiology
   ➡Dilatation proximal to obstruction

- Accumulation of gas
  - Swallowed air and significant overgrowth of both aerobic and anaerobic organism resulting in gas production
- Accumulation of fluid - Accumulation of saliva, bile, pancreatic secretions and gastric secretions
  ➡ Compression distal to obstruction
- Bowel below obstruction exhibits normal peristalsis and absorption
- Eventually becomes empty and collapses
  ➡Dehydration and electrolyte loss
- Decreased oral intake
- Loss due to vomiting
  - Loss of fluid containing Na+, K+, Cl-, H+ and metabolic alkalosis
- Defective intestinal absorption
- Fluid sequestration in bowel lumen
- Transudation of fluid into extracellular space and peritoneal cavity

2. Pathogenesis of strangulation
   ➡Impaired venous and lymphatic return

- Venous and lymphatic congestion resulting in edematous tissues
  ➡ Compromised blood supply
- Leads to bowel ischemia, necrosis and subsequently perforation

IV. **Clinical manifestations**

1. Signs and symptoms
   (Cardinal features of IO = Abdominal pain + Distension + Vomiting + Absolute constipation)
   ➡Abdominal pain

- Sudden onset
- Colicky in nature and replaced by constant diffuse pain - Paroxysmal of pain coinciding with increased peristaltic activity - Progression from cramping to more focal and constant pain may indicate peritoneal
  irritation related to complications such as bowel ischemia and necrosis
- Located in periumbilical region (small bowel) or infraumbilical (large bowel)
  ➡Distension
- The more _distal_ the obstruction, the _greater_ the distension
  ➡ Vomiting
- The more _distal_ the obstruction, the _longer_ it take for the onset of nausea and vomiting
- Character of vomitus changes from digested food to feculent material as obstruction
  progresses due to enteric bacterial overgrowth
  ➡Absolute constipation
- Inability to pass feces and flatus
  - Feature of complete intestinal obstruction

| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small bowel obstruction | High Predominant | Minimal and central            | Early, profuse, rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance | ➡Little evidence of dilated small bowel loops            |
|                         | Low              |                                | Delayed and late electrolyte imbalance                      | ➡Multiple dilated small bowel loops                      |
| Large bowel obstruction | Less severe      | Pronounce and lower in abdomen |                                                             | ➡ Dilated colon proximal to obstruction                  |

608

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡️ CBC with differentials
   - Anemia
   - Leukocytosis with left shift in abdominal infection or complications
   - Platelet count as baseline for surgical planning
     ➡️ LFT
   - Rule out other cause of abdominal pain
     ➡️ RFT
   - Assess hydration and severity of hypovolemia
   - Evaluate creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels
   - Hyponatremia due to vomiting
     - Loss of Na⁺ and water from gastric secretions in severe vomiting
   - Hypokalemia due to vomiting - K+ in gastric secretions is in fact quite low (10 mmol/L) and thus hypokalemia is primarily due to increased urinary loss - Metabolic alkalosis increases plasma HCO3 concentration which rises above the resorptive threshold and the increased NaHCO3 are delivered to distal K+ secretory site which increases urinary K+ secretion (urinary potassium wasting) - Metabolic alkalosis also shifts K+ into cells in exchange for H+ into bloodstream - Hypovolemia-associated activation of RAAS leads to Nat and water reabsorption and concomitantly urinary K+ secretion
     ➡️ Serum amylase
   - Pancreatitis as cause of paralytic ileus
     ➡️ Serum lactate
   - Sensitive markers for bowel ischemia
     ➡️ Arterial blood gas (ABG)
   - Metabolic acidosis
     - Lactic acidosis from bowel ischemia
     - Hypovolemia causing hypoperfusion of other organs
   - Metabolic alkalosis - Vomiting of gastric acid leading to loss of H+ ions
     ➡️ Blood culture
   - Indicated in patients presenting with systemic signs including fever, tachycardia, hypotension and altered mental status

4. Radiological tests
   ➡CXR (Erect)
   _ Look for free gas under diaphragm
   ➡Abdominal X-ray (AXR) (Erect and supine)
   _ Supine AXR (more useful)
   _ Look for presence of rectal gas and locate site of obstruction more clearly
   _ Air-fluid interface is parallel to X-ray plate and the entire width of air and fluid-filled loops of bowel will be visible and thus allows estimation of the amount of distension
   _ Erect AXR
   _ Look for air-fluid level and free gas under diaphragm
   _ Air-fluid interface is perpendicular to X-ray plate and air-fluid level is evident
   _ Fluid is collected at the pelvis which obscure views for cecum and rectum
   _ Lateral decubitus AXR
   _ Demonstrate free air or air-fluid levels in patients who cannot be placed into an upright position \* Features of bowels on AXR

➡CT abdomen with or without contrast

- More useful than AXR in identifying the specific site (i.e. transition zone) and severity of obstruction (i.e. partial or complete obstruction)
- Determines etiology by identifying masses, hernia or inflammatory changes
- Determines complications such as ischemia, necrosis and perforation
- CT findings of IO
  - Presence of air-fluid levels
  - Dilated proximal bowels with distal collapsed bowel
- CT findings of etiology of IO
  - "Target sign" which refers to alternating hypodense and hyperdense layers indicative of intussusception
  - "Whirl sign" which refers to rotation of small bowel mesentery indicative of volvulus
  - "Apple-core" lesions which is indicative of colorectal cancer
- CT findings of complicated IO (ischemia)
  - Pneumatosis intestinalis
  - Bowel wall thickening
  - Reduced or lack of bowel wall enhancement
  - Edematous and thickened mesentery
  - Engorgement of mesenteric vessels
  - Presence of portal venous gas

➡Gastrografin meal and follow-through

- Gastrografin meal and follow-through is indicated in adhesive IO only
- Detect the level of obstruction and whether it is partial or complete
- X-ray is taken every 30 mins until 4 hours (delayed film)
  - 2-hour film is most important
- Water-soluble contrast is both diagnostic and therapeutic
  - Draws fluid into lumen of bowel due to hypertonicity
  - Decreases intestinal wall edema and stimulates intestinal peristalsis

➡ Colonoscopy

- Not usually needed as an initial diagnostic modality but can aid in diagnosis of those with chronic symptoms for whom large bowel obstruction cannot be excluded on AXR
- Diagnostic and therapeutic
  - Insertion of metallic stent for palliation in non-resectable metastatic disease
  - Decompression in sigmoid volvulus and pseudo-obstruction

It consists of bullet points and sub-bullet points describing CT scans, gastrografin meals, follow-through procedures, and colonoscopies. The text details what each procedure reveals, such as specific sites of obstruction, etiology, and complications, along with specific findings related to each diagnostic modality.]
    612

VI. Treatment

1. General approach
   ➡Conservative (non-operative) management

- IV and electrolyte rehydration and nasogastric decompression may be curative
- Exclusion of complicated obstruction is required
- Duration of observation = 48-72 hours in which if no improvement is seen then the patient should be surgically explored
- Frequent monitoring to look for resolution - Clinical: Decreased abdominal distension/ Reduced nasogastric output/ Passage of flatus or stool per rectum - Radiological: Resolution in abdominal X-ray (AXR)
  ➡Surgical management
- Should be delayed until resuscitation is complete provided there is no sign of strangulation or evidence of closed-loop obstruction
- All patients with suspected complicated bowel obstruction based upon clinical or radiological examination should be offered surgical management
  - Includes patients with complete obstruction, close-loop obstruction, bowel ischemia, necrosis or perforation

2. Supportive management
   ➡Nil per os (NPO)

- All patients should made NPO to limit bowel distension
  ➡IV fluid infusion (Drip and suck)
- External loss due to vomiting
- Internal loss due to sequestration of fluid in the bowel as part of the non-functional ECF (third space loss) leading to intravascular volume depletion
- Crystalloids such as normal saline (NS), Ringer's lactate or Hartmann's solution
- K+ replacement may be indicated but should be given cautiously in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) from severe dehydration
  ➡Nasogastric (NG tube) decompression (Drip and suck)
- Achieved by non-vented (Ryle) or vented (Salem Sump) tube
- Placed on free drainage with 4-hourly aspiration
- Functions - Decompression proximal to obstruction - Reduce risk of aspiration during induction of anesthesia and post-extubation
  ➡Pain relief
- Pain management with opioids is reasonable although pain from mechanical bowel obstruction in general is often not amendable to treatment with analgesics
  ➡Antibiotic prophylaxis
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics due to bacterial overgrowth
- Mandatory for all patients undergoing surgery for intestinal obstruction
- Warranted especially in patients with complicated obstruction
  ➡Gastrografin meal and follow-through
- Detect the level of obstruction and whether it is partial or complete
- X-ray is taken every 30 mins until 4 hours (delayed film)
  - 2-hour film is most important
- Water-soluble contrast is both diagnostic and therapeutic - Draws fluid into lumen of bowel due to hypertonicity - Decreases intestinal wall edema and stimulates intestinal peristalsis
  613

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡Indications for urgent surgery

- Strangulated (Complicated) obstruction
- Closed-loop obstruction
- Peritonitis
- Incarcerated or strangulated hernia
  ➡Resection of non-viable intestine

| Circulation            | Viable                                   | Non-viable                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
|                        | ➡Dark color becomes lighter              | ➡ Dark color persists     |
|                        | Visible pulsation in mesenteric arteries | ➡ No detectable pulsation |
| General appearance     | ➡ Shiny                                  | ➡ Dull and lusterless     |
| Intestinal musculature | ⇨ Firm                                   | ➡ No peristalsis          |
|                        | ➡Peristalsis may be observed             |                           |

➡Treatment of adhesions

- Adhesiolysis
  - Lysis of adhesion and release of constricting bands
  - Resection only on causative adhesions and remaining adhesions (if present) should be left in situ unless angulation is present as division of these adhesions will only cause further adhesion formation

➡Treatment of intussusception

- Non-operative reduction with air or barium enema
  - Successful reduction can only be accepted if there is free reflux of air or barium into the small bowel with resolution of symptoms
  - Contraindicated if there are presence of peritonitis or perforation
- Operative reduction
  - Achieved by gently compressing most distal part of intussusception towards its origin
  - Assessment of intestinal viability after reduction and resect if indicated

➡Treatment of volvulus

- Cecal volvulus
  - Volvulus is usually ischemic and requires resection
  - Decompression and reduction of volvulus if viable
  - Caecopexy by fixation of cecum to right iliac fossa
- Sigmoid volvulus
  - Endoscopic decompression by flexible sigmoidoscopy
  - Sigmoid colectomy in indicated in young patients because of high rates of recurrence with endoscopic decompression alone but not in elderly patients

614

➡Treatment of malignancy

- Stenting
  - Bridge to surgery since temporary decompression of colon provides a window of time prior to surgery to correct fluid depletion and electrolytes and bowel preparation
  - Palliative treatment for patients who are not surgical candidates
- Bowel resection

- Bowel bypass
  - Entero-enterostomy, entero-colostomy, colo-colostomy can be used to bypass masses of matted intestine

VII. Complications

1. Strangulation
   ➡General features

- Blood supply is compromised when bowel dilation is excessive
- Bowel becomes ischemic and leads to necrosis or perforation
  ➡Causes of strangulation
- ↑ Intra-luminal pressure
- Direct pressure on bowel wall
- Interrupted mesenteric blood flow
  ➡Features suggestive of strangulation
- Clinical (Signs): Fever/ Tachycardia/ Peritoneal signs
- Clinical (Symptoms): Continuous or worsening abdominal pain
- Biochemical: Leukocytosis/ Metabolic acidosis
- Radiological: Pneumoperitoneum/ Pneumatosis intestinalis/ Portal venous gas
  ➡ Prognosis
- Morbidity and mortality are dependent on duration of ischemia and its extent
- Any length of ischemic bowel can cause significant systemic effects secondary to sepsis and dehydration

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Hernia

I. **Overview**

1. General features
   ➡Hernia is the protrusion of portion of organ or tissue through an abnormal opening in the wall that normally contains it

2. Classification of abdominal wall hernia

[Diagram of a torso showing different types of hernias. The torso is a light tan color. "Epigastric hernia" is written next to a yellow box that is near the top of the abdomen, slightly below the sternum. "Umbilical hernia" is written next to a yellow box that is centered on the belly button. "Incisional hernia" is written next to a blue box on the left side of the abdomen, below the umbilical hernia. "Spigelian hernia" is written next to a pink box on the right side of the abdomen, at the same level as the incisional hernia. "Inguinal hernia" is written next to a pink box in the groin area on the left side of the body. "Femoral hernia" is written next to a yellow box in the groin area on the right side of the body.]

➡Classification according to region of abdominal wall they appear

- Groin hernia = Inguinal/ Femoral
- Ventral hernia = Epigastric/ Umbilical/ Spigelian/Parastomal/Incisional
  - Epigastric hernia are defects in midline between umbilicus and xiphoid process
  - Spigelian hernia passes along semilunar line which is the caudal most extent of posterior rectus sheath
- Pelvic hernia = Obturator/ Sciatic
  - Obturator hernia passes through the obturator foramen
  - Sciatic hernia passes through either the greater sciatic foramen above or below the pyriformis muscle or through the lesser sciatic foramen
- Flank hernia = Lumbar - Lumbar hernia occurs in a region bounded superiorly by 12th rib, inferiorly by crest of iliac bone, medially by erector spinae muscle and laterally by IO muscle
  ➡Classification according to etiology
- Congenital hernia = Defect in abdominal wall is present from birth
- Acquired hernia = Defect develops as a result of weakening or disruption of fibromuscular tissues of abdominal wall
  ➡Special types of hernia
- Pantaloon hernia = Presence of both direct and indirect hernia
- Sliding hernia = Internal organ forming part of the hernia wall usually sigmoid colon
  616

3. Descriptive terminology
   ➡Reducible hernia

- Pressure forces the peritoneum through the defect and into subcutaneous tissue
- Sac of peritoneum allows bowel and omentum to pass through the defect
- Intraperitoneal organs can move freely in and out of the hernia
  ➡Irreducible hernia
- Bowel becomes trapped and unable to return to the main peritoneal cavity if adhesions form or the defect is small
- Higher risk of further complications
  ➡Incarcerated hernia
- Imply a hernia that is irreducible and developing towards strangulation
  ➡Strangulated hernia
- Occurs when tissue is trapped inside a hernia and if hernia contains bowel it may become partially or totally obstructed
- Narrow neck impedes venous return and increases pressure within hernia
- Decreased arterial blood flow and contents become ischemic and infarcted when the pressure rises sufficiently
- Resulting tension and vascular compromise leads to pain and tenderness requiring urgent surgery
- Infarcted hernia
- Contents of hernia have become gangrenous
- Associated with a high mortality

4. Different types of hernia
   ➡Umbilical and periumbilical hernia

- Occurs due to stretching and thinning of the linea alba
- Acquired causes include increased intraabdominal pressure due to obesity, pregnancy, chronic cough and constipation, abdominal distension and ascites
- Small hernia contains extraperitoneal fat or omentum whereas large hernia contains small or large bowel with a high risk of incarceration and strangulation
- Differences between umbilical and paraumbilical hernia

| Location   | Umbilical hernia              | Paraumbilical                |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Appearance | Occurs through umbilical scar | Occurs around umbilical scar |
| Age group  | Round-shaped                  | Crescent-shaped              |
|            | Congenital                    | Adults                       |

- Surgical treatment - Small and asymptomatic hernia do NOT require repair and can be observed - Symptomatic umbilical hernia should be surgically treated
  ➡Incisional hernia
- Hernia that develop at sites where an incision has been made
- Always check for the size of defect
- Risk factors (conditions that impair wound healing)
  - Infection/ Immunosuppression/ Obesity/ Malnutrition/ Smoking/ Excessive wound tension/ Wound dehiscence
- Surgical treatment
  - Indicated when symptomatic, potential for bowel incarceration or strangulation or sufficient size to complicate dressing and activities of daily living
  - Principles of surgery include dissection of hernia sac with closure of defect using mesh repair technique

617

## II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology

   ➡ Incidence
   - Inguinal hernia are more common than femoral hernia (< 10%)
     - Indirect inguinal hernia is the **MOST** common groin hernia in both sexes

   ➡ Age distribution
   - Median age of diagnosis in males = 50 - 69
   - Median age of diagnosis in females = 60 - 79

   ➡ Sex distribution
   - Hernia are more generally more common in males
     - Deep inguinal ring is narrower in women and hence a lower incidence of indirect inguinal hernia
   - Femoral hernia occurs more commonly in females
     - Related to comparatively less muscle bulk compared with men or weakening of musculature from childbirth
     - Inguinal hernia is still more common among females

   ➡ Other features of hernia
   - Right-sided inguinal hernia are more common
     - Related to later descent of the right testicle and later obliteration of processus vaginalis
   - Femoral hernia occurs later in life than inguinal hernia
   - Femoral hernia present with more complications such as incarceration and strangulation than inguinal hernia

## III. Etiology

1. Risk factors

   ➡ Non-modifiable risk factors
   - Male sex
   - Caucasian race
   - Aging
     - Degenerative weakness of muscles and fibrous tissue
   - Pregnancy
     - Hormonal-induced laxity of pelvic ligaments
   - Family history of hernia
   - History of hernia or hernia repair

   ➡ Modifiable risk factors
   - Obesity
   - Chronic cough
   - Chronic constipation
   - Abdominal wall injury or trauma
   - Smoking

POSTERIOR (INTERNAL) VIEW
(Right side)

➡ Structures of inguinal canal

- Inguinal canal is an oblique channel through abdominal wall through which
  - Spermatid cord passes from abdomen into scrotum in males
  - Round ligament of uterus passes from abdomen into labia majora in females
- Deep (_internal_) inguinal ring
  - Defect in the transversalis fascia
  - 2 cm above the midpoint of inguinal ligament (between ASIS and PT)
- Superficial (_external_) inguinal ring
  - Defect in the external oblique aponeurosis
  - Above and medial to pubic tubercle
- Inguinal ligament
  - External oblique rolls inwards and thickens to become inguinal ligament

4. Anatomy of femoral hernia

[Detailed anatomical illustration of the femoral hernia region. The image shows the anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral aspects of the hernia. Structures like the inguinal ligament, iliopectineal ligament, lacunar ligament, external iliac vessels, femoral ring, inferior epigastric vessels, genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve, testicular artery and vein, deep inguinal ring, rectus sheath, and rectus abdominis muscle are labeled. An arrow points to each structure from the corresponding text label. There are two images, one focusing on the upper part of the region, and the other focusing on the lower region of the hernia. In the lower image, the vas deferens is also labeled.]

V. # Pathogenesis

1. Natural causes of hernia
   ➡ Natural weakness

- Lumbar triangles
- Posterior wall of inguinal canal
  ➡ Weakness due to structures entering and leaving abdomen
- Esophagus → Hiatus hernia
- Femoral vessels → Femoral hernia
- Obturator nerve → Obturator hernia
- Sciatic nerve → Sciatic hernia

2. Congenital hernia
   ➡ Congenital hernia is due to failure of processus vaginalis to close (patent processus vaginalis)

- Natural history of a patent processus vaginalis is closure within 2 months in 40% and within 2 years in an additional 20%
- Half of the remaining 40% of patient develop clinical hernia
  ➡ Development of processus vaginalis

## What is it?

This project is meant to be a fun experience on how to build a large LLM in a tiny way. This approach works because we are using a tiny architecture and a small vocabulary.

I encourage you to get in and change the code, and to make it your own.

You can find a video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yYvEaLp4ZM&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy) explaining how this code works.

## Usage

1. Setup env

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Download the TinyShakespeare dataset from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt). and save it into a folder called `data/`.

3. Train the model

```bash
python3 train.py
```

4. Generate text

```bash
python3 generate.py
```

## Contribute

Feel free to open issues if you have any questions or suggestions. Also, feel free to contribute to the project by opening pull requests.

## TODO

- [ ] Add support for GPU training
- [ ] Add support for more datasets
- [ ] Improve the code quality
- [ ] Add more documentation
- [ ] Add more tests

| Males   | ➡Gubernaculum (caudal genital ligament) normally migrates through deep inguinal ring into inguinal canal- Upper portion of gubernaculum degenerates- Lower portion of gubernaculum remains as scrotal ligament securing the testicles to the lower part of scrotum limiting its mobility- Inguinal component of gubernaculum degenerates in males- Deep inguinal ring normally closes once the testicles has descended- Failure of deep ring to close combined with failure of obliteration of processus vaginalis provides the defect through which abdominal tissues can pass                                      |
| Females | ➡Gubernaculum does NOT migrate- Upper portion of gubernaculum forms suspensory ligament of ovary- Runs from mid-portion of fallopian tube and terminating just beyond the superficial inguinal ring- Lower portion of gubernaculum is bent into an angular form- Cephalic to the bend forms round ligament of ovary- Caudal to the bed forms round ligament of uterus- Inguinal component of gubernaculum remains in females as round ligament- Runs through deep inguinal ring through inguinal canal and ends in the fat of labia majora or outside superficial ring without attachment or extension to the labium |

VI. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Groin discomfort

- Heaviness or dull discomfort in the groin
  - Pain with hernia is unusual and when present should raise the possibility of a incarceration or strangulation
- Exacerbated by increased intraabdominal pressure such as straining, prolong standing or heavy lifting - Result of constriction of contents of hernia at the neck of hernia sac
  ➡Groin swelling (bulge)
- 2/3 of hernia are located on the right side
- Cough produces a distinct soft impulse that increases the protrusion
  - Different from the firmer impulse that is felt when the intact abdominal wall is tensed with coughing

2. Signs and symptoms of strangulation
   ➡ Fever

- Generalized peritonitis typically does NOT occur since the ischemic or necrotic tissue is trapped within the hernia sac
  ➡ Groin pain
  ➡ Erythema of groin skin
  ➡Features of intestinal obstruction
- Abdominal pain
- Abdominal distension
- Nausea and vomiting
- Constipation

# VII. Diagnosis

## 1. Physical examination

[Diagram of the groin area, showing the location of the deep inguinal ring, pubic symphysis, inguinal ligament, pubic tubercle, and ASIA. The deep inguinal ring is represented by a small blue circle located to the right and slightly above the ASIA, which is depicted as a red triangle. The pubic symphysis is shown as a large, red rectangle located towards the right side of the image. The inguinal ligament is represented by two thin, slightly curved red lines stretching between the ASIA and the pubic tubercle. The pubic tubercle is depicted as a large red square. ]

➡ 3C + Hand hygiene
➡ Position the patient in standing position with full exposure from upper abdomen to thigh

- Ask the patient to point where the lump has been seen or felt - True size of hernia may not be appreciated in supine position - Hernia usually reduce on lying and reappear on standing
  ➡ Inspection
- Scars from previous surgery
- Lumps and swellings on both sides and presence of scrotal swelling
- Overlying skin changes
  - Presence of edema and erythema may point towards strangulation
- Ask the patient to cough^1 and look for a visible expansile cough impulse
- Ask the patient to look down at the toes to tense abdominal muscle
- Ask the patient to reduce the hernia or reduce the lump by gentle pressure in the direction of inguinal canal - Comment whether the lump is reducible or not
  ➡ Palpation
- ASK for any pain before palpation
- Feel for size, border, surface, consistency, temperature and tenderness
- Try to get above the hernia
  - CANNOT get above a hernia
  - Can get above a hydrocele in the inguinal canal
- Ask the patient to cough^2 and feel for a palpable cough impulse
  - Reduce the hernia before asking the patient to cough
  - Cough impulse is felt due to increased intra-abdominal pressure being transmitted into the hernia
- Look for inguinal lymphadenopathy
  ➡ Lay the patient supine
- Determine the type of hernia in relation to inguinal ligament and pubic tubercle
  - Pubic symphysis is the first bony prominence when move inferior from umbilicus
  - Pubic tubercle is the first bony prominence lateral to pubic symphysis
  - Medial + Above pubic tubercle points towards inguinal hernia
- Perform the occlusion test
  - Place finger over deep inguinal ring and ask the patient to stand up again
    - Deep inguinal ring is 2 cm above the midpoint of inguinal ligament
  - Patient is asked to turn his head away and cough^3
  - Direct hernia if hernia reappears medial to deep inguinal ring
  - Indirect hernia if hernia is controlled with pressure on deep inguinal ring
  - Pantaloon hernia if hernia appears slightly on coughing and appears even more fully after removal of compression
- Removal of finger and observe + Check for the other side
  - Direct hernia if hernia project forward
  - Indirect hernia if hernia slide obliquely

- Completion of examination
  - Genital examination of testes and scrotum (males) and contralateral groin for hernia
    - Check for scrotal extension of indirect inguinal hernia
      - Indirect inguinal hernia may descend through superficial ring immediately above pubic tubercle into the scrotum
    - Check for undescended testes since there is a higher chance of indirect inguinal hernia and underlying testicular malignancy
    - Check for baseline testicular volume since post-operatively can be complicated by testicular atrophy
  - Per rectal (PR) examination
    - Lower 1/2 of anal canal drains to superficial inguinal lymph node
  - Per vagina (PV) examination
    - Lower 1/3 of vagina drains to superficial inguinal lymph node

2. Radiological tests
   - AXR
     - NOT routinely indicated unless intestinal obstruction is suspected in cases of incarceration and strangulation
   - USG groin
     - Imaging modality of choice
     - Non-invasive and inexpensive with high sensitivity and specificity for hernia
     - Useful to identify occult hernia in patients with suggestive symptoms but no detectable hernia on physical examination
   - CT/MRI groin
     - ONLY indicated when physical examination cannot definitely identify the hernia
     - Differentiate inguinal from femoral hernia

VIII. Treatment (Inguinal hernia)

1. Overview
   ➡ Indications of surgical repair

- Complicated hernia
- Symptomatic/ Asymptomatic femoral hernia
- Symptomatic inguinal hernia - Groin pain with exertion - Inability to perform daily activities due to pain or discomfort - Inability to manually reduce the hernia
  ➡ Contraindications of surgical repair
- Pregnancy - Pregnant woman should not have elective surgical repair of inguinal or femoral hernia until at least 4 weeks after delivery - Urgent surgical repair can still be performed if patient presents with evidence of complications
  ➡ Choice of surgical approach

2. Pre-operative preparation
   ➡Confirm presence and location of hernia immediately prior to surgery
   ➡Obtain informed consent

- Benefits and risks of hernia repair versus watchful waiting
- Benefits and risk of open versus laparoscopic approach
- Inform patient the risk of post-operative chronic groin pain or discomfort after hernia repair
  ➡Medical risk assessment
- Directed towards ensuring patient can tolerate anesthesia
  ➡Prophylactic antibiotics
- Prevent surgical site and mesh infection
- Administered within one hour of time of incision to be effective
- Covers usual skin flora in uncomplicated cases and should be even more broad-spectrum in complicated cases
  ➡Anesthetic choice
- Open repair requires LA administered as nerve block of ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves (but GA is also possible)
- TEP requires GA (but spinal or epidural anesthesia is also possible)
- TAPP requires GA

3. Open surgical technique
   ➡Different types of hernia repair

- Herniotomy = Excision of hernia sac after reduction of content
- Herniorrhaphy = Herniotomy + Strengthen posterior wall of inguinal canal without mesh
- Hernioplasty = Herniotomy + Strengthen posterior wall of inguinal canal with mesh

# 4. Laparoscopic surgical technique

➡Laparoscopic technique

- Involves approaching the hernia defect from its posterior aspect
- Involves placing mesh in the preperitoneal space

| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Description   | ➡Performed in the preperitoneal space - Surgeon develops a space between peritoneum and anterior abdominal wall ➡Avoid risk associated with entering the peritoneal cavity          | ➡Performed transabdominally ➡Placement of mesh in preperitoneal position which is covered by peritoneum to keep mesh away from bowel                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Advantages    | ➡Less intraabdominal adhesions formation ➡Bilateral hernia repair - Single balloon dissection develops working space in both groins - Placement of large pieces of mesh is possible | ➡Larger working space - Different hernia defects are well-visualized allowing easier hernia repair ➡Lower risk of conversion to open - Can be attempted in patients with prior lower abdominal surgery - TEP is not possible with prior preperitoneal pelvic dissection - Open surgery is still preferred |
| Disadvantages | ➡Conversion to TAPP or open may be required if failed to develop preperitoneal space                                                                                                | ➡Intraabdominal adhesions formation ➡Injury to adjacent intraabdominal organs                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Early          | ➡Wound or mesh infection - Occurs within first few weeks after surgery or months later - Presents with fever, chills or malaise and physical examination shows pain, erythema, warmth, swelling or a draining fistula - Initially start empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, localized fluid collections can be treated with percutaneous drainage but surgical debridement of infected or necrotic tissues with mesh removal is required if patient presents with systemic signs and symptoms of sepsis ➡Seroma/Hematoma/ Bruising - Collection of fluid or blood in the dead space that remains once a hernia sac is reduced - Vascular injury to epigastric artery or vein, external iliac artery or vein can cause bleeding and hematoma formation - Fluid collection mostly resolves without treatment and should not be aspirated in the absence of features of infection as this poses the risk of introducing infection into a sterile site |
| Late           | ➡Post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia - More common in females - Groin pain should subside within an expected time interval - Chronic pain following hernia repair persists for more than 3 months is likely to be due to neuralgia - Neuralgia results from injury or entrapment of sensory nerves that innervates the groin including ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric and genital branch of genitofemoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve - Minimized by avoiding manipulation of nerves during dissection and repair or by selective neurectomy - Neurectomy is selected for cases involving inadvertent trauma to a nerve or when the location of nerve would make entrapment with sutures during mesh fixation ➡Ischemic orchitis/ Testicular atrophy - Interference with blood supply to testes typically resulting from dissection of indirect hernia from cord structures - Direct injury or extrinsic compression of cord structures              |

[Image Description: The table has two columns and four rows with the title "5. Complications". The first column is labeled "Classification" and the second "Description". The rows correspond to the phases Immediate, Early, and Late. The Immediate phase includes Acute retention of urine and Bladder injury, where the Bladder can be damaged during trocar insertion. The Early phase presents Wound or mesh infection, occurring within weeks after surgery, showing fever, chills, malaise, and pain. It also includes Seroma/Hematoma/Bruising. The Late phase refers to Post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia and Ischemic orchitis/ Testicular atrophy due to interference with blood supply or direct injury.]

6. Post-operative follow-up
   ➡Early mobilization is important
   ➡Keep area clean and wash carefully especially after the clips or sutures have been removed

- Patients are able to bathe immediately
  ➡Patients may need to be off work for 4 – 6 weeks if their job involves heavy lifting
  ➡Should take laxatives if they get constipated post-operatively
  ➡Avoid prolonged coughing

IX. Treatment (Femoral hernia)

1. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Open approach

| Classification | Surgical procedure                |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Open           | Mesh repair ➡ Lockwood's approach |

Infra-inguinal (low) approach
Simplest operation but only suitable when there is no risk of bowel strangulation
➡ Lotheissen's approach
Inguinal approach
➡McEvedy's approach
Supra-inguinal (high) approach
Complex operation and is ideal in emergency situation where risk of bowel strangulation is high
Non-mesh repair ➡McVay repair
Involves incising transversalis fascia in the region of Hesselbach's triangle to enter the preperitoneal space to expose the iliopectineal (Cooper's) ligament|
|**Remarks:** Lichtenstein repair is **NOT** applicable to femoral hernia since it does not cover the femoral ring|

➡Laparoscopic approach

| Approach    | Totally extraperitoneal repair (TEP)   | Transabdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP) |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Description | ➡ Performed in the preperitoneal space |

Surgeon develops a space between peritoneum and anterior abdominal wall
➡Avoid risk associated with entering the peritoneal cavity|➡Performed transabdominally
➡Placement of mesh in preperitoneal position which is covered by peritoneum to keep mesh away from bowel|
|Advantages|➡Less intraabdominal adhesions formation
➡Bilateral hernia repair
Single balloon dissection develops working space in both groins
Placement of large pieces of mesh is possible|➡Larger working space
Different hernia defects are well-visualized allowing easier hernia repair
➡Lower risk of conversion to open
Can be attempted in patients with prior lower abdominal surgery
TEP is not possible with prior preperitoneal pelvic dissection
Open surgery is still preferred|
|Disadvantages|➡Conversion to TAPP or open may be required if failed to develop preperitoneal space|➡Intraabdominal adhesions formation
Injury to adjacent intraabdominal organs|

635

X. **Complication of hernia**

1. Intestinal obstruction
   ➡Loop of bowel is trapped in hernia sac such that bowel lumen but not its blood supply is
   obstructed
   ➡Presents with abdominal pain, distension, nausea and vomiting and constipation

2. Strangulation
   ➡Bowel necrosis as a result of strangulation is the most serious complication
   ➡Incarceration of inguinal hernia

- Males: Compromise blood supply to testes resulting in ischemic necrosis and atrophy as
  well as injury to vas deferens
- Females: Torsion rather than direct compression compromises blood supply to ovaries

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Diverticular disease

I. Overview

1. Definition
   ➡ Diverticulum = Sac-like protrusion (Outpouching) of a hollow viscus
   ➡ Diverticulosis = Presence of diverticulum which can be symptomatic or asymptomatic
   ➡Diverticular disease is defined as clinically significant and symptomatic diverticulosis due to
   _ Diverticulitis = Inflammation of a diverticulum
   _ Acute VS Chronic diverticulitis
   _ Uncomplicated VS Complicated diverticulitis (abscess, fistula, bowel obstruction or perforation)
   _ Diverticular bleeding
   _ Painless hematochezia (usually massive but self-limited in 80% of patients)
   _ Due to segmental weakness of vasa recta associated with a diverticulum (erosion of peridiverticular arterioles)
   _ Typically occurs in the ABSENCE of diverticulitis
   _ Diverticular colitis
   _ Also known as segmental colitis associated with diverticula (SCAD)
   _ Inflammation in the interdiverticular mucosa without involvement of diverticular orifices
   _ Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD)
   _ Persistent abdominal pain attributed to diverticulum in the absence of macroscopically overt colitis or diverticulitis \* Presence of wall thickening in the absence of inflammatory changes on CT

2. Terminology
   ➡ True VS False diverticulum
   _ True diverticulum involves all layers (whole thickness) of intestinal wall
   _ False diverticulum involves only mucosa and submucosa of intestinal wall
   ➡ Other types of diverticulum
   _ Meckel's diverticulum
   _ Incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct leading to the formation of a true diverticulum arising from the antimesenteric surface of mid-to-distal ileum
   _ Zenker's diverticulum
   _ False diverticulum arising from the Killian's triangle which is an area of muscular weakness between transverse fibers of cricopharyngeus and oblique fibers of lower inferior constrictor muscle

3. Hinchey classification
   ➡ Clinical staging of complicated diverticulitis \* Geared towards choosing the proper surgical procedure when diverticulitis is complicated

| Classification | Description                      | Treatment                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stage I        | Pericolic or mesenteric abscess  | Conservative management with antibiotics, bowel rest and monitoring Can be treated as outpatient in stable patients |
| Stage II       | Walled-off pelvic abscess        | IV antibiotics + Bowel rest + Image-guided drainage Possible surgical intervention.                                 |
| Stage III      | Generalized purulent peritonitis | IV antibiotics+ Bowel rest + Surgery                                                                                |
| Stage IV       | Generalized fecal peritonitis    | IV antibiotics+ Bowel rest + Surgery                                                                                |

637

II. **Epidemiology**

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ Mean age of diagnosis of acute diverticulitis = 63 years
   ➡ Regional variation

- Diverticulosis in Westerners is predominantly left-sided (involve sigmoid colon)
- Diverticulosis in Asians is still predominantly left-sided but the proportion of right-sided diverticulosis (involve cecum) is significantly higher
  - OFTEN confused with acute appendicitis

III. **Etiology**

1. Risk factors
   ➡ Obesity - Increases risk of diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding
   ➡ Dietary factors

- Fat and red meat
- Low fiber diet - Dietary fibers may decreased intestinal inflammation and alter the intestinal microbiome
  ➡ Physical activity
- Decrease physical activity
  ➡ Smoking
  ⇨ Drugs
- NSAIDs
- Steroids
- Opiates
  [Image Description: The image is a PDF page containing text about the epidemiology and etiology of a disease, possibly diverticulitis. It includes headers for "Epidemiology" and "Etiology", followed by numbered lists and bullet points detailing aspects like age of diagnosis, regional variations, risk factors such as obesity and dietary factors, and drugs like NSAIDs and steroids. The text is organized with indentation to show relationships between different points.]

638

IV. Pathogenesis

1. Diverticulosis

[Diagram of a Diverticulum shows penetration into muscular wall resulting in weakness leading to out-pouching. Labels include: Vasa recta, Diverticulum, Antimesenteric taenia, Mesenteric taenia, Epiploic appendage, and Antimesenteric Intertaenial area.]

➡Diverticulum develops at well-defined points of weakness

- Corresponds to the site at which vasa recta penetrate the circular muscle layer of colon
  - Vasa recta are arteries coming from arcades in the mesentery
- Typically a false diverticulum in which mucosa and submucosa herniate through muscle layer covered only by serosa
  ➡Development of diverticulum
- Increased intraluminal pressure
  - Predisposes to herniation of mucosa and submucosa
  - Lack of dietary fibers result in smaller stool volume which require higher intraluminal pressure and higher colonic wall tension for propulsion
- Abnormal colonic motility - Exaggerated segmentation contractions separate lumen into chambers
  ➡ Explanation of propensity of sigmoid diverticulum\*
- Laplace's law states that pressure is proportional to wall tension and inversely proportional to bowel radius
- Sigmoid colon is the segment with smallest diameter and thus the site of highest intraluminal pressure during segmentation of the colon
- Structural changes such as thickening of circular muscle layer, shortening of taeniae and luminal narrowing in an attempt to decrease resistance of wall to intraluminal pressure

2. Diverticulitis
   ➡Underlying cause of diverticulitis is microscopic or macroscopic perforation of diverticulum

- Erosion of diverticular wall by increased intraluminal pressure or inspissated food particles leading to inflammation and focal necrosis and subsequently perforation
- Obstruction of diverticulum by fecaliths leading to increased diverticular pressure and subsequently perforation

639

3. Diverticular bleeding

[Image Description: There are two endoscopic images side by side, showing the interior of a colon. Both images display a round, dark hole, which is a diverticulum, in the pink, fleshy wall of the colon. The diverticulum in the left image has a red streak leading to it, indicating a possible site of bleeding. The colon wall is ribbed and folded, giving depth to the image. The right image provides a closer view of a similar diverticulum, with a more pronounced inner depth.]

➡ When diverticulum herniates the penetrating vessel responsible for wall weakness at that point
becomes draped over the dome of diverticulum

- Blood vessel becomes separated from the bowel lumen only by mucosa
- Vasa recta is exposed to injury along its luminal aspect leading to eccentric intimal
  thickening and thinning of the media
- Changes result in segmental weakness of artery and subsequently rupture and bleeding
  ➡ Right colon is usually the source of colonic diverticular bleeding
- Right-sided colon has a thinner wall
- Right-sided diverticula has wider necks and domes which expose a greater length of vasa
  recta to injury

4. Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD)
   ➡ Altered colonic motility may be the underlying basis of symptoms in SUDD
   ➡ Visceral hypersensitivity

- Heightened pain perception related to increased neuropeptides and alterations in enteric
  innervation following an episode of diverticulitis

640

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms (acute diverticulitis)
   ➡ Fever

- Low-grade fever
  ➡Lower abdominal pain
- Usually in the LLQ due to involvement of the sigmoid colon
- May involve RLQ and suprapubic area due to presence of a redundant inflamed sigmoid colon or a right-sided cecal diverticulitis
- Constant in nature and lasts for several days prior to presentation
  ➡Nausea and vomiting
- Result of bowel obstruction or an paralytic ileus due to peritoneal inflammation

2. Signs and symptoms of complications
   ➡ **Abscess**

- Persistent fever (despite antibiotics)
- **NO** improvement in abdominal pain (despite antibiotics)
  ➡ **Fistula**
- Colovesical fistula
  - Pneumaturia
  - Fecaluria
  - Dysuria (Recurrent UTI)
- Colovaginal fistula
  - Vaginal passage of faeces and flatus
    ➡**Obstruction**
- Abdominal pain + Abdominal distension + Vomiting + Constipation
- Bowel sounds
  - Hyperactive with obstruction
  - Absence of sluggish with paralytic ileus
- **Perforation**
- Hemodynamic instability
  - Hypotension
  - Shock
- Peritoneal signs
  - Guarding
  - Rigidity
  - Rebound tenderness
- Bowel sounds
  - Absence of bowel sounds

641

3. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Colorectal cancer (CRC)

- Similar clinical features and bowel wall thickening on abdominal CT scan
- Features suggestive of acute diverticulitis include presence of pericolonic and mesenteric inflammation, involvement of > 10 cm of colon and absence of enlarged pericolonic lymph nodes on abdominal CT scan
- CRC can only be excluded with colonoscopy after resolution of acute inflammation
  ➡Acute appendicitis
- Presents with RLQ pain, anorexia, fever, nausea and vomiting
- Abdominal pain is initially periumbilical and subsequently migrated to the RLQ
  ➡Inflammatory bowel disease
- Diarrhea rather than abdominal pain is the predominant symptoms
  Infectious colitis
- Diarrhea rather than abdominal pain is the predominant symptoms
  Ischemic colitis
- Presents with rapid onset of abdominal pain, hematochezia or bloody diarrhea
- Patients usually has risk factors for ischemic colitis including advanced age, hypertension, DM, dehydration, laxative use or hemodialysis
  ➡ Gynecological disorders
- Tubo-ovarian abscess
- Ovarian torsion
- Ectopic pregnancy
  Urological disorders
- Cystitis
- Nephrolithiasis

VI. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡Abdominal examination

- Tender abdominal mass
  - Result of pericolonic inflammation or peridiverticular abscess
- Peritoneal signs - Rigidity - Localized guarding - Rebound tenderness
  ➡Digital rectal examination (DRE)
- Mass or tenderness
  - Presence of distal sigmoid abscess

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Leukocytosis
  ➡Electrolyte profile
  ➡Serum amylase and lipase
  ⇨LFT
  ⇨ RFT
  ➡ Urinalysis
- Sterile pyuria due to adjacent inflammation
  Urine culture
- Presence of colonic flora indicates colovesical fistula

642

3. Radiological tests
   ➡ CXR and AXR

- Presence of pneumoperitoneum with free air under diaphragm in perforation
- Air-fluid levels with bowel dilation due to obstruction or paralytic ileus
- Soft tissue densities due to presence of an abscess
  ➡ Abdominal USG
- Features of acute diverticulitis
  - Presence of diverticula in surround segments
  - Bowel wall thickening (segmental mural thickening > 4 mm) at the point of maximal tenderness
  - Hypoechoic peridiverticular inflammatory reaction
  - Mural and peridiverticular abscess formation with or without gas bubbles
- Detects presence of complications
  - Abscess = Anechoic mass containing echogenic debris
  - Fistula = Presence of hypoechoic area next to inflamed diverticula with extraluminal air bubbles extending in the bladder, vagina or abdominal wall
  - Perforation = Ascites, diffuse peritoneal thickening and scattered loculated fluid collections in presence of peritonitis
    ➡ CT abdomen + pelvis with contrast
- Features of acute diverticulitis
  - Presence of colonic diverticula
  - Presence of localized bowel wall thickening (> 4 mm)
  - ↑ Soft tissue density within pericolonic fat secondary to pericolonic inflammation (fat stranding)
- Detects presence of complications
  - Abscess = Fluid collections surrounded by areas with inflammatory changes with centre of collection containing air, air-fluid levels or tissue with low attenuation representing necrotic debris
  - Fistula = Extracolonic air collections within organs other than bowel and abdominal wall
  - Obstruction = Presence of dilated loops of bowel with air-fluid levels in proximity of an area with pericolonic inflammation (fat stranding)
  - Perforation = Presence of free air in patients with peritonitis
    ➡ MRI abdomen + pelvis
- Avoid radiation exposure
- Features of acute diverticulitis
  - Presence of colonic diverticula
  - Colonic wall thickening
  - Pericolonic exudates and edema
    ➡ Barium enema
- NOT recommended and relatively contraindicated in the acute setting
- Contrast enema and small bowel studies are extremely useful in defining the course of fistula in complicated diverticulitis

[Image Description: The image is a page from a medical textbook or document, focusing on radiological tests used in diagnosing diverticulitis. It outlines various imaging techniques like CXR, AXR, abdominal USG, CT scans, MRI, and Barium enema. Each technique is described with specific findings indicative of acute diverticulitis or its complications, such as pneumoperitoneum, bowel wall thickening, abscesses, fistulas, and perforations. Special emphasis is given to the utility and limitations of each method.]

➡ Colonoscopy

- **NO** role in establishing the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis as the inflammation is peridiverticular
- Should be avoided in the acute setting due to the risk of perforation during air insufflation or exacerbation of existing inflammation
- Can be used in the setting of diverticular bleeding
  - May be difficult to identify and localize the bleeding site and mucosal lesion cannot be seen given the presence of lots of blood clots and absence of adequate bowel preparation
  - Colonoscopy can occasionally identify a bleeding diverticulum that may then be treated with adrenaline injection or metallic clips for hemostasis
- Patient **MUST** be evaluated for malignancy after resolution of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis since the presentation of colorectal cancer is very similar
  - Standard practice is to perform a colonoscopy **6 weeks** after recovery to definitely rule out underlying colorectal cancer

➡Mesenteric angiogram

- Indicated when colonoscopy cannot accurately localize the diverticular bleeding source
- 3-vessel mesenteric angiogram including celiac artery, SMA and IMA
- Detects diverticular bleeding > 1 mL/min
- Embolization is **NOT** recommended since there is high risk of bowel gangrene

➡ RBC scan

- Indicated when colonoscopy cannot accurately localize the diverticular bleeding source
- Technetium-tagged RBC scan
- Detect slow intermittent bleeding > 0.1 mL/min

644

## VII. Treatment

1. General principles

   ➡ Emergency surgery
   - Frank (free) perforation
   - Failure of medical treatment with IV antibiotics
   - Colonic obstruction
   - Abscess failing non-operative intervention

   ➡Elective surgery (Sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis) (Interval colectomy)
   - Previous complicated diverticulitis
   - Immunocompromised patients
   - Inability to exclude malignancy
   - **X** Recurrent episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis
     - Previously thought that risk of complications increases with recurrent disease but is now proven to be wrong

   ➡Management of diverticular bleeding
   - Fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion
   - Colonoscopy to identify bleeding sites and achieve hemostasis with adrenaline injection or metallic clips
   - Indications for laparotomy and subtotal or total colectomy
     - Hemodynamically unstable despite adequate resuscitation
     - Excessive blood transfusion > 6 units
     - Frequent rebleeding or persistent bleeding

2. Medical treatment

   ➡Outpatient treatment
   - One of the following antibiotic regimen for 7 - 10 days
     - Amoxicillin-clavulanate
     - Metronidazole + Cotrimoxazole
     - Ciprofloxacin
     - Moxifloxacin

   ➡Inpatient treatment
   - Piperacillin tazobactam
   - Metronidazole + Cephalosporin/ Fluoroquinolone

[Image Description: The number 645 is at the bottom right corner of the page, indicating the page number of the document]

3. Surgical treatment
   [Illustration of two human colons. The colon on the left appears to have had a section removed, with the two ends stitched together. A small piece of the colon is also removed separately. The colon on the right also appears to have had a section removed, but the two ends are not stitched together. Instead, the upper end of the colon is stitched off at the end.]

➡ Surgical approach by clinical staging

- Localized contamination (Hinchey I or II)
  - Patients can tolerate a preoperatively bowel preparation
  - Resection of colonic segment with abscess and a primary anastomosis can be performed in these patients
- Diffuse contamination (Hinchey III or IV)
  - Primary anastomosis is contraindicated due to excessive contamination or inflammation of surrounding tissues increasing risk of anastomotic leakage
  - Preferred surgical treatment is a Hartmann's procedure with end colostomy
    ➡ Colonic resection with primary anastomosis (1-stage procedure)
- Indicated in patients with Hinchey I or II diverticulitis
- Colonic segment is resected together with abscess with primary anastomosis
  - Proximal resection margin = Where colon becomes soft, uninflamed and non-edematous (not necessary to resect all diverticulum-bearing colon since diverticula in transverse or descending colon rarely cause further symptoms)
  - Distal resection margin = Upper 1/3 of the rectum (rectum is NEVER involved in diverticulitis since taeniae coli has fused)
    ➡ Colonic resection with end colostomy (Hartmann's procedure) (2-stage procedure)
- **MOST** commonly performed and the preferred approach
- Indicated in patients with Hinchey III or IV diverticulitis
- Stage I: Resection of diseased colonic segment
  - Creating an end colostomy to divert fecal stream
  - Creation of a rectal stump by sewing off the rectum
- Stage II: Reversal of colostomy
  - Intestinal continuity is re-established by a descending colorectostomy
    ➡ Colonic resection with primary anastomosis and protective ostomy (2-stage procedure)
- Indicated in patients with Hinchey III or IV diverticulitis (OR) Hinchey I or II with relative contraindication of primary anastomosis but bowel is not edematous
- May be more appropriate in stable patients and offers the great advantage that the subsequent operation to restore bowel continuity is simpler than is takedown of a Hartmann's pouch
  - Reversal of loop ileostomy is easier than reversal of Hartmann
- Stage I: Resection of diseased colonic segment with primary anastomosis and creation of a protective ostomy
  - Large intestines have a less optimal blood supply due to limited collateralization and hence its primary anastomosis are more prone to leakage
  - Creates a proximal diverting stoma by colostomy or ileostomy to protect the primary anastomosis to reduce septic complication in cases of leakage but NOT reduce anastomotic leakage
- Stage II: Reversal of colostomy
  - Closure of the stoma in the subsequent operation

646

➡Laparoscopic peritoneal lavage

- Reserved for Hinchey II or III patients
- Peritoneal lavage and drainage with drains placed near the affected colon
- Approach to avoid laparotomy and fecal diversion in patients with complicated diverticulitis
- Several studies have shown laparoscopic lavage and drainage without bowel resection may be safe and effective even in the presence of free perforation but this approach remains controversial and require additional prospective trials before recommendations
  VIII. Complication

1. Complication of diverticulitis
   ➡Abscess

- Occurs in 17% of patients with acute diverticulitis
- Should be suspected in patients with no improvement in abdominal pain or a persistent fever despite 3 days of antibiotic treatment
- May develop a pyogenic liver abscess due to spread of infection through the portal circulation
  ➡ Fistula
- Inflammation may result in formation of fistula between colon and adjacent fistula
- Most commonly involve the bladder (colovesical fistula) followed by affecting the vagina (colovaginal fistula) especially in post-hysterectomy patients
- Colocutaneous fistula are uncommon and are usually easy to identify
- Coloenteric fistula are also uncommon and may be entirely asymptomatic or result in corrosive diarrhea
- Management of fistula - Control sepsis by antibiotics and drainage - Fistula is usually managed at the index operation with resection of affected segment of colon involved with diverticulitis usually with a primary anastomosis - Simple repair of the secondarily involved organ such as primary closure of bladder or vagina (may require flap depending on complexity)
  ➡ Obstruction
- Partial colonic obstruction occurs because of relative luminal narrowing due to pericolonic inflammation or compression from a diverticular abscess
- Complete colonic obstruction occurs because recurrent attacks of acute diverticulitis result in progressive fibrosis and scarring leading to formation of intestinal strictures
- Localized irritation can lead to development of paralytic ileus
  ➡ Perforation
- Rupture of a diverticular abscess into peritoneal cavity
- Rupture of an inflamed diverticulum with fecal contamination of the peritoneum
- Leads to generalized purulent or fecal peritonitis

647

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease)

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Focal patchy transmural inflammation involving entire GIT from mouth to perianal area

- MOST commonly affects the terminal ileum (predominant small bowel) ± colon
  ➡ Clinical subtypes of Crohn's disease
- Ileal disease (24.5%)
- Ileocecal disease (43.1%)
- Colonic disease (32.3%)
- Perianal disease
- Others: CD confined to mouth, stomach, duodenum or rectum only
  ➡ Indeterminate colitis
- Accounts for 10 – 15% of patients with IBD
- Fail to classify between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
- Can be due to inadequate tissue biopsy or a truly indeterminate form of disease
- Surgical treatment for these patients is similar to UC

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ Bimodal distribution

- Affects young patients in 20 – 30 years old
- Affects older patients in 50 – 60 years old
  ➡ Female predominance
- In contrast with no gender predominance in ulcerative colitis (UC)
- Male predominance is observed in East Asia

### III. Etiology

1. Risk factors
   - Medical history
     - Infectious gastroenteritis in prior 1 year
   - Surgical history
     - Prior appendicectomy is a risk factor for Crohn's disease
   - Family history
     - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
   - Social history
     - Smoking (**ONLY** in Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis)

### IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   - Abdominal pain
     - Crampy abdominal pain
     - Pathophysiology
       - Transmural inflammation results in fibrotic stricture leading to obstruction
   - Diarrhea
     - Prolonged and fluctuates over a period of time
     - Pathophysiology
       - Excessive fluid secretion and impaired fluid resorption in inflamed bowels
       - Bile salt malabsorption due to inflamed or resected terminal ileum
       - Bacterial overgrowth from small bowel strictures and enterocolonic fistula
   - Steatorrhea
     - Pale, greasy, smelly and bulky stool that floats on water and difficult to flush away
     - Steatorrhea may lead to malnutrition, clotting abnormalities, osteomalacia and hypocalcemia causing tetany
     - Pathophysiology
       - Bile acid malabsorption due to an inflamed or resected terminal ileum
       - Bacterial overgrowth from small bowel strictures and enterocolonic fistula
   - Hematochezia
     - Stool may reveal presence of microscopic levels of blood
     - Gross bleeding is less frequent than ulcerative colitis
   - Constitutional symptoms
     - Fever
       - Result of inflammatory process itself
       - Result of perforation with a complicating bowel infection
     - Fatigue
     - Anorexia
     - Weight loss
       - Result of malabsorption
       - Decreased oral intake in patients with obstructing segments of bowel
   - Anemic symptoms (due to hematochezia or vitamin B12 deficiency)
     - Pallor
     - Dyspnea
     - Palpitation
     - Fatigue

650

2. Signs and symptoms of complications
   ➡Fistula formation

- Transmural inflammation leads to development of sinus tract
- Sinus tract that penetrates the serosa give rise to fistulas
- Fistulas are communication that connect two epithelial-lined organs
- Different types of fistula - Enteroenteric fistula → Palpable mass - Enterovesical fistula → Urinary symptoms due to UTI - Enterovaginal fistula → Passage of gas or faeces through vagina - Enterocutaneous fistula → Drainage of bowel contents to surface of skin - Retroperitoneal fistula → Psoas abscess or ureteral obstruction with hydronephrosis
  ➡Phlegmon formation
- Some sinus tracts may present as a phlegmon
- Phlegmon is a walled off inflammatory mass without bacterial infection
- Phlegmon may be palpable on abdominal examination - Ileal involvement is suggested by a mass if RLQ
  ➡Abscess formation
- Some sinus tracts may lead to abscess formation and presents as acute localized peritonitis with fever, abdominal pain and tenderness
- Abscess perforation can lead to diffuse peritonitis
  ➡Perianal disease
- Perianal pain and drainage
- Formation of skin tags, anal fissures, perirectal abscess and anorectal fistulas

3. Extra-intestinal manifestations
   ➡**Vascular**: Arterial and venous thromboembolism (portal and mesenteric thrombosis/ DVT)
   ➡**Hepatobiliary**: Primary sclerosing cholangitis/ Fatty liver/ Autoimmune liver disease
   ➡**Gastrointestinal**: Colorectal cancer
   ➡**Ocular**: Uveitis/ Episcleritis/ Scleritis/ Iritis/ Conjunctivitis
   ➡**Urogenital**: Renal stones
   ➡**Hematology**: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
   ➡**Endocrine**: Vitamin B12 deficiency
   ➡**Dermatological**: Erythema nodosum (more common)/ Pyoderma gangrenosum
   ➡**Musculoskeletal**: Arthritis/ Ankylosing spondylitis/ Osteoporosis/ Osteomalacia

4. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Ulcerative colitis
   ➡Irritable bowel syndrome

- Presents with chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of an organic cause
  ➡Infectious colitis
- Infection including E.coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia and amebiasis should be excluded with stool studies
- C. difficile infection should be considered particularly in patients treated with antibiotics
  ➡Lactose intolerance
- Intolerance to lactose-containing food such as dairy products
- Presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea and flatulence after ingestion of milk or milk-containing products

651

V. **Diagnosis**

1. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials - Anemia
   O Iron deficiency anemia
   O Anemia of chronic disease
   O Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
   ➡ Electrolyte profile
   ➡ Inflammatory markers - ↑ ESR and CRP
   O CRP in Crohn disease is typically higher than ulcerative colitis
   O CRP monitoring under therapy is useful to document efficacy of anti- inflammatory treatment - ↑ Fecal calprotectin
   O Useful in distinguish inflammatory GI disease from non-inflammatory causes
   O Correlates with disease activity in CD and UC and thus useful in monitoring response to treatment
   ➡ LFT - Hypoalbuminemia
   • Malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy
   ⇨ RFT
   ➡ Serum iron and vitamin B12 level - Vitamin B12 deficiency
   ➡ Serological markers - Antisaccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA)
   O Common in Crohn disease (CD) - Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA)
   O Common in ulcerative colitis (UC) - Anti-OmpC antibody
   O Potential serological marker for inflammatory bowel disease
   ➡ Stool tests - Microscopy: Ova*, Parasites* - Culture: Escherichia coli O157:H7*, Salmonella*, Shigella*, Yersinia*, Campylobacter - Antigen detection: Escherichia coli O157:H7*, Entamoeba*, Cryptosporidium, Giardia - PCR: Clostridium difficile toxin A (enterotoxin) and B (cytotoxin)\*/ Shiga toxin
   O Clostridium toxins for antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis
   [Image Description: The image is a PDF page showing a list of biochemical tests used for diagnosis. The tests are categorized into CBC with differentials, electrolyte profile, inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP, and fecal calprotectin), LFT, RFT, serum iron and vitamin B12 level, serological markers (ASCA, pANCA, and Anti-OmpC antibody), and stool tests (microscopy, culture, antigen detection, and PCR).]

2. Radiological tests
   ⇨ CXR
   _ Indicated in patients presenting with fever or if perforation is suspected
   ⇨ AXR
   _ Indicated to evaluate for colonic calibre
   _ Toxic megacolon is defined as total or segmental non-obstructive dilatation of colon ≥ 6 cm or cecum > 9 cm and the presence of systemic toxicity
   ➡ Colonoscopy + Biopsy
   _ Biopsy should be taken from the left and right colon and rectum even normal in appearance to assess for microscopic inflammation
   _ MUST do AFB smear and culture with sensitivity testing to rule out enteric TB
   _ Histological findings

➡Ultrasound (USG)

- USG for diagnosis for ileal Crohn's disease
- Endoanal USG can be used to identify fistula tracts
  ➡Capsule endoscopy
- Should be avoided in patients with suspected intestinal stricture due to possibility of retained capsule
  ➡CT/ CT enterography/ enteroclysis (CTE)
- Visualization of small intestines to look for small bowel involvement
- Evaluate extra-intestinal complications
  ➡MRI/ MR enterography/ enteroclysis (MRE)
- Visualization of small intestines to look for small bowel involvement
- Evaluate extra-intestinal complications
  ➡Barium studies
- Assess location and extend of disease and look for strictures and fistula
- Barium enema
  - Alternative to ileocolonoscopy to evaluate the large bowel for colonic disease
  - Detects aphthous ulcers, strictures, perforations with fistula tracts
- Small bowel follow-through (SBFT)
  - Nodularity, strictures and ulceration
  - "Cobblestone" appearance
  - "String sign" due to luminal narrowing

VI. **Treatment**

1. General approach
   ➡ Principles of management

- To induce and maintain remission taking into account on disease activity, disease site, disease behavior and patient preference
- Trend towards early introduction of immunomodulator and biologics in patients with adverse prognostic factors
  - Young age < 40
  - Extensive small bowel disease
  - Perianal involvement
  - Presence of strictures
  - Presence of deep colonic ulcers
  - Steroids required in initial treatment
- Avoidance of triggering factors
  - Smoking cessation

2. Medical treatment
   ➡ **Antibiotics**

- Indications
  - Active luminal disease (For primary or adjunctive therapy for colonic Crohn's disease but **NOT** isolated small intestine disease)
  - Perianal diseases such as fistula
  - Septic complications of IBD such as abscess and wound infections
- **Mechanism of action:** Efficacy may be due to treatment of an undetected pathogen, bacterial overgrowth or an unsuspected microperforation
- Example: Ciprofloxacin/ Metronidazole

➡ **5-aminosalicylates** (5-ASA)

- Initial therapy in patients with mild to moderate Crohn disease who do not have systemic symptoms based on its relative safety to other drugs
- **Mechanism of action** = Anti-inflammatory effect
- **Clinical role** = Induction agent (Induction of remission)
  - NO consistent evidence that is effective in maintenance of remission
  - Mesalamine can be used as maintenance after surgical intervention but **NOT** after medically induced remission
- Dosage
  - Mesalamine = 2 - 4 g/day
  - Sulfasalazine = 3 – 6 g/day
- Adverse effects
  - Mesalamine: Nephrotoxicity
  - Sulfasalazine: Nausea/ Headache/ Fever/ Agranulocytosis/ Pancreatitis/ SJS
- Example: Mesalamine ( _Pentasa/ Asacol_ )/ Sulfasalazine
  - Mesalamine is more commonly used for both ileitis and colitis
  - Mesalamine is **NOT** useful in active diseases
  - Sulfasalazine is used for colitis only since colonic bacteria must cleave the drug to release the 5-ASA moiety
  - Sulfasalazine is associated with "sulfa" allergy and pregnancy complications including kernicterus (cross placenta) and neural tube defect (inhibit absorption and metabolism of folic acid)

➡ Glucocorticoids

- Indicated in patients who do not respond to 5-ASA and antibiotics
- Calcium and vitamin D supplements required for osteoprotective effect if prescribed for more than 12 weeks
- Clinical role = Induction agent (Induction of remission)
  - Ineffective in maintenance of remission and NOT used for long-term
- Dosage
  - Prednisolone = 40 mg/day reducing by 5 mg/day at weekly intervals; 20 mg/day for 4 weeks reducing by 5 mg/day at weekly intervals
  - Budesonide = 9 mg/day
- Example: Budesonide/ Prednisolone
  - Prednisolone is more commonly used
  - Budesonide is indicated for terminal ileum or ileocecal disease
  - Budesonide has extensive first pass effect in liver and hence less systemic side effects but also less effective

➡ Immunomodulators

- Indicated in patients with refractory disease
- Clinical role = Maintenance agent (Maintenance of remission) + Steroid-sparing
- Start EARLY since it has delayed onset of action and takes around 2 - 3 months for drug level to accumulate before becoming effective and it is steroid-sparing
- Regular monitoring of CBP for leukopenia and LFT for deranged liver function for potential bone marrow toxicity and hepatotoxicity
- Check thiopurine methyl-transferase (TPMT) level if available
  - Both TPMT enzyme activity (phenotype) and genotype should be obtained
  - Metabolic pathway = AZA → 6-MP → 6-TG and 6-MMP
  - TPMT metabolizes 6-TG into 6-MMP
  - 6-TG levels predict bone marrow toxicity and therapeutic efficacy
  - 6-MMP levels predict hepatotoxicity
  - **High TPMT activity**: Higher 6-MMP and increase risk of hepatotoxicity
  - **Low TPMT activity** (homozygous mutation of TPMT): Higher 6-TG and increase risk of myelosuppression
- Dosage
  - Azathioprine = 1.5 – 2.5 mg/kg/day
  - 6-Mercaptopurine = 0.75 – 1.5 mg/kg/day
  - Methotrexate (IM/SC) = 25 mg/week x 16 weeks for induction; 15 mg/week for maintenance (+ folic acid supplementation 5 mg weekly PO 3 days after starting methotrexate)
- Adverse effects (of AZA)
  - Myelosuppression
  - Hepatotoxicity
  - Pancreatitis
- Example: Azathioprine (AZA)/ 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP)/ Methotrexate
  - Methotrexate is indicated in active or relapsing disease refractory to or intolerant of AZA or 6-MP

656

➡Biologic therapies (Anti-TNFα)

- Indicated in patients with refractory disease or patients with extra-intestinal manifestations and fistulas
- **MUST** screen for TB with CXR/ QuantiFERON-TB Gold + HBV infection with HBsAg
  - Requires TB prophylaxis with isoniazid or rifampicin
  - Requires HBV prophylaxis with entecavir
- Clinical role = Induction agent/ Maintenance agent
- Dosage
  - Infliximab = Loading with 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 week for induction; then at every 8 week-intervals IV infusion for maintenance
  - Adalimumab = Loading with 80mg/40mg or 160mg/80mg at 0, 2 week for induction; then 40 mg at every 2 week for maintenance
  - Do not stop anti-TNFa easily unless there is deep remission of at least 18 months with normal blood and endoscopic parameters
- Contraindications
  - Latent untreated or active TB
  - Lymphoma
  - Heart failure of NYHA Class III – IV
  - Demyelinating disease (Multiple sclerosis)
  - Optic neuritis
- Adverse effects
  - Reactivation of infection (e.g. TB/HBV)
  - Lymphoma
  - Non-melanoma skin cancer
- Example: Infliximab (Remicade) (1st line) / Adalimumab (Humira)
  - Infliximab is a chimeric anti-TNF antibody given intravenously (response quicker and better)
    (Induction = IV 5 mg/kg at 0, 2, 6 weeks; **Maintenance** = IV 5 mg/kg Q8 weeks)
  - Adalimumab is a humanized anti-TNF antibody given subcutaneously (response slower and less effective)
    (Induction = SC 160 mg at 0 week and 80 mg at 2 weeks; **Maintenance** = SC 40 mg Q2 weeks)

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡Avoid surgery until absolute necessary

- Surgical treatment is **NOT** curative in Crohn's disease and is mainly used to treat complications only
- Bowel preserving surgery should be performed as repeated bowel resections can lead to short gut syndrome - Conservative and minimal resection as possible - Extended resection does not decrease recurrence
  ➡Indications
- Persistent symptoms refractory to medical treatment
- Presence of complications including - Severe bleeding - Strictures (Intestinal obstruction) - Abscess - Fistula - Perforation/ Sepsis - Malignancy
  ➡Surgical procedures
- Small bowel involvement
  - Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis
- Large bowel involvement
  - Right hemicolectomy is **MOST** commonly performed
  - Total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) if rectum spared
  - Total proctocolectomy with ileo-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) in patients with limited perianal disease
  - Total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy if rectum affected
- Strictures
  - Small intestine: Small bowel strictureplasty/ Endoscopic dilatation/ Resection
    - Short stricture < 10 cm = Heineke-Mikulicz strictureplasty
    - Long stricture 10 – 20 cm = Finney strictureplasty
    - Distal ileal strictures are sometimes amendable to balloon dilatation
    - Bypass is **NOT** recommended since there is risk of malignant transformation in the bypassed segment
  - Large intestine: Endoscopic dilatation/ Resection
    - **NO** role for strictureplasty in Crohn's colitis since there is a 7% risk of malignancy over 20 years
- Fistula (_SNAP_ management principle)
  - Sepsis control: Antibiotics + Percutaneous abscess drainage (CT-guided)
  - Nutrition support: TPN aids closure of fistula
  - Anatomical location: Imaging to locate fistula
    - Fistulogram/ CT or MR enteroclysis
  - Procedure: Medical treatment by Infliximab (OR) Surgical treatment by en-bloc resection of bowel involving fistula with primary anastomosis and diverting stoma
- Perianal disease
  - Examination under anesthesia (EUA) to assess extent of disease
  - Antibiotics with ciprofloxacin or metronidazole for infection control
  - Abscess: Simple drainage of collection
- Fistula
  - Simple fistula: Fistulotomy
  - Complex fistula: Seton drainage/ Azathioprine/ Biologics (Infliximab/ Adalimumab)

Short-segment stricture < 10 cm
(Heineke-Mikulicz strictureplasty)

[Illustration showing a surgical procedure: 1. a short stricture is opened along the antimesenteric surface of the bowel wall; 2. the enterotomy is closed transversely.]

Long-segment stricture > 10 cm
(Finney strictureplasty)

[Illustration showing a surgical procedure: 1. a long stricture is opened along the antimesenteric surface of the bowel wall; 2. the bowel is folded into an inverted U; 3. side-to-side anastomosis is made.]

VII. **Prevention**

1. Screening of colorectal cancer (CRC)
   ➡American Gastroenterological Association (AGA guidelines)

- Colonoscopy after **8 years** in patients with pan-colitis (extensive disease)
- Colonoscopy after 15 years in patients with colitis involving left colon only (limited disease)
- Repeat colonoscopy every 1 – 2 years
- Ulcerative proctitis or proctosigmoiditis are **NOT** considered at increased risk and o not require regular surveillance endoscopy
- Surveillance colonoscopy should be performed when the disease is in remission ideally
  ➡Methods for surveillance
- Chromoendoscopy
  - Highest yield for dysplasia detection
  - Involves topical application of methylene blue or indigo carmine to enhance mucosal irregularities and facilitate targeted biopsies
- High-definition white light colonoscopy
  - Alternative which also has high diagnostic yield for dysplasia
  - Preferred when chromoendoscopy yield is decreased or the mucosa is poorly visualized such as with inadequate preparation, active inflammation or in the setting of pseudopolyps and strictures
- Narrow band imaging (NBI)
  - Endoscope-based image-enhanced technology that enhances the fine structure of mucosa without the use of dyes
  - Does **NOT** enhance dysplasia detection

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Inflammatory bowel disease (Ulcerative colitis)

I. Overview

1. General features

➡ Diffuse continuous inflammation limited to mucosa and submucosa layer of colon
➡ **MOST** commonly affects the rectum and extend in a proximal and continuous fashion to involve other parts of colon (occasionally backwash ileitis)

- Affects rectum = Proctitis
- Affects rectum + sigmoid = Proctosigmoiditis (34.5% in HK)
- Affects rectum + sigmoid + colon up to splenic flexure = Distal UC (32% in HK)
- Affects rectum + sigmoid + colon beyond splenic flexure = Pancolitis (33.5% in HK)
- Affects ileum = Backwash ileus

➡ Indeterminate colitis

- Accounts for 10 – 15% of patients with IBD
- Fail to classify between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
- Can be due to inadequate tissue biopsy or a truly indeterminate form of disease
- Surgical treatment for these patients is similar to UC

   ➡Irritable bowel syndrome - Presents with chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of an organic cause
   ➡Infectious colitis - Infection including E.coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia and amebiasis should be excluded with stool studies - C. difficile infection should be considered particularly in patients treated with antibiotics
   ➡Radiation colitis - Occurs in weeks to years after abdominal or pelvic irradiation
   ➡Medication-associated colitis - NSAIDs can cause chronic diarrhea and bleeding
   ➡Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome - Presents with abdominal pain, altered bowel habits and bleeding - Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome has a characteristic appearance on histology with a thickened mucosal layer and distortion of crypt architecture

663

V. Diagnosis

1. History taking
   ➡ Drug history

- NSAIDs
- Antibiotics use - Clostridium difficile-associated infectious colitis
  ➡Sexual history
- Neisseria gonorrhoea and HSV are associated with proctitis
  ➡Travel history

- Anemia
  - Iron deficiency anemia
  - Anemia of chronic disease
  - Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
    ➡Electrolyte profile

- ↑ ESR and CRP
  - CRP in Crohn disease is typically higher than ulcerative colitis
  - CRP monitoring under therapy is useful to document efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment
- ↑ Fecal calprotectin
  - Useful in distinguish inflammatory GI disease from non-inflammatory causes
  - Correlates with disease activity in CD and UC and thus useful in monitoring response to treatment
    ➡ LFT
- Hypoalbuminemia
  - Malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy
    ⇨ RFT
    ➡Serum iron and vitamin B12 level
- Vitamin B12 deficiency

- Antisaccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA)
  - Common in Crohn disease (CD)
- Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA)
  - Common in ulcerative colitis (UC)
- Anti-OmpC antibody
  - Potential serological marker for inflammatory bowel disease
    ➡Stool tests
- Microscopy: Ova*, Parasites*
- Culture: Escherichia coli O157:H7*, Salmonella*, Shigella*, Yersinia*, Campylobacter
- Antigen detection: Escherichia coli O157:H7*, Entamoeba*, Cryptosporidium, Giardia

4. Radiological tests
   ⇨ CXR
   _ Indicated in patients presenting with fever or if perforation is suspected
   ⇨ AXR
   _ Indicated to evaluate for colonic calibre
   _ Toxic megacolon is defined as total or segmental non-obstructive dilatation of colon ≥ 6 cm or cecum > 9 cm and the presence of systemic toxicity
   ➡ Colonoscopy/ Flexible sigmoidoscopy + Biopsy
   _ Biopsy should be taken from the left and right colon and rectum even normal in appearance to assess for microscopic inflammation
   _ MUST do AFB smear and culture with sensitivity testing to rule out enteric TB
   _ Montreal phenotypic classification
   _ According to extent of inflammation observed at colonoscopy
   _ Influences treatment modality and timing of starting surveillance and its frequency

- Lower sensitivity than barium enema
  ➡ MRI/ MR enterography/ enteroclysis (MRE)
- Demonstrate marked thickening of bowel wall but non-specific
- Lower sensitivity than barium enema
  ➡ Barium studies
- Barium enema
  - Diffusely reticulated pattern with superimposed punctate collections of barium in microulcerations
  - Shortening of colon and narrowing of luminal calibre
  - Loss of haustrations
  - Pseudopolyps and polyps

VI. Treatment

1. General approach
   ➡ Principles of management

- To induce and maintain remission taking into account on disease activity, disease site, disease behavior and patient preference
  ➡ Treatment according to disease severity
- Start with topical treatment if mild left-sided disease
- Start with oral treatment if extensive disease
- Combination therapy (topical + oral) is more effective in inducing remission
- Consider rescue therapy in steroid-refractory disease (Day 3)
- Consider surgical treatment if no improvement within Day 4 – 7 of rescue therapy

668

2. Medical treatment
   ➡Antibiotics

- Antibiotics have **MINIMAL** role in treatment of active disease in UC - Indications - Septic complications of IBD such as fulminant colitis - Example: Ciprofloxacin/Metronidazole
  ➡5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA)
- Initial therapy in patients with mild to moderate UC who do not have systemic symptoms based on its relative safety to other drugs
- Topical 5-ASA is the first-line treatment in mild to moderate UC in those who are willing to use rectal therapy including suppositories or enemas
- Mechanism of action = Anti-inflammatory effect
- Clinical role = Induction agent and maintenance agent
- Route of administration
  - Mesalamine: Oral/ Enema/ Suppository
  - Sulfasalazine: Oral
- Adverse effects
  - Mesalamine: Nephrotoxicity
  - Sulfasalazine: Nausea/ Headache/ Fever/ Agranulocytosis/ Pancreatitis/ SJS
- Example: Mesalamine (Pentasa/Asacol)/ Sulfasalazine/ Olsalazine - Both mesalamine and sulfasalazine are used for induction and maintenance - Sulfasalazine is associated with "sulfa" allergy and pregnancy complications including kernicterus (cross placenta) and neural tube defect (inhibit absorption and metabolism of folic acid)
  ➡Glucocorticoids
- Calcium and vitamin D supplements required for osteoprotective effect if prescribed for more than 12 weeks
- Clinical role = Induction agent (Induction of remission)
  - Ineffective in maintenance of remission and NOT used for long-term
- Route of administration
  - Budesonide: Oral/ Enema/ Suppository
  - Prednisolone: Oral/ Enema/ Suppository
  - Hydrocortisone: IV
- Example: Budesonide/ Prednisolone/ Hydrocortisone
  - Budesonide or prednisolone enema or suppository is used for distal colitis
  - Oral budesonide or prednisolone is used for mild to moderate disease
  - IV hydrocortisone is used for severe disease

669

Immunomodulators

- Clinical role = Maintenance agent (Maintenance of remission) + **Steroid-sparing**
- Start **EARLY** since it has delayed onset of action and takes around 2 – 3 months for drug level to accumulate before becoming effective and it is steroid-sparing
- Regular monitoring of CBP for leukopenia and LFT for deranged liver function for potential bone marrow toxicity and hepatotoxicity
- Check thiopurine methyl-transferase (TPMT) level if available
  - Both TPMT enzyme activity (phenotype) and genotype should be obtained
  - Metabolic pathway = AZA → 6-MP → 6-TG and 6-MMP
  - TPMT metabolizes 6-TG into 6-MMP
  - 6-TG levels predict bone marrow toxicity and therapeutic efficacy
  - 6-MMP levels predict hepatotoxicity
  - **High TPMT activity**: Higher 6-MMP and increase risk of hepatotoxicity
  - **Low TPMT activity** (homozygous mutation of TPMT): Higher 6-TG and increase risk of myelosuppression
- Adverse effects (of AZA)
  - Myelosuppression
  - Hepatotoxicity
  - Pancreatitis
- Example: Azathioprine (AZA)/ 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP)/ Cyclosporin/ Tacrolimus
  - Methotrexate is **NOT** effective in UC unlike in Crohn's disease

[This is the number 670 at the bottom right of the page.]

➡Biologic therapies (Anti-TNFα)

- Indicated in patients with refractory disease to 5-ASA, immunomodulators and steroids
- **MUST** screen for TB with CXR/ QuantiFERON-TB Gold + HBV infection with HBsAg
  - Requires TB prophylaxis with isoniazid or rifampicin
  - Requires HBV prophylaxis with entecavir
- Clinical role = Induction agent/ Maintenance agent
- Dosage
  - Infliximab = Loading with 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 week for induction; then at every 8 week-intervals IV infusion for maintenance
  - Adalimumab = Loading with 80mg/40mg or 160mg/80mg at 0, 2 week for induction; then 40 mg at every 2 week for maintenance
  - Do not stop anti-TNFα easily unless there is deep remission of at least 18 months with normal blood and endoscopic parameters
- Contraindications
  - Latent untreated or active TB
  - Lymphoma
  - Heart failure of NYHA Class III - IV
  - Demyelinating disease (Multiple sclerosis)
  - Optic neuritis
- Adverse effects
  - Reactivation of infection (e.g. TB/HBV)
  - Lymphoma
  - Non-melanoma skin cancer
- Example: Infliximab (Remicade) (1st line) / Adalimumab (Humira)
  - Infliximab is a chimeric anti-TNF antibody given intravenously (response quicker and better)

    (**Induction** = IV 5 mg/kg at 0, 2, 6 weeks; **Maintenance** = IV 5 mg/kg Q8 weeks)

  - Adalimumab is a humanized anti-TNF antibody given subcutaneously (response slower and less effective)

    (**Induction** = SC 160 mg at 0 week and 80 mg at 2 weeks; **Maintenance** = SC 40 mg Q2 weeks)

671

# 3. Surgical treatment

➡Surgery is usually not indicated in UC but is potentially curative
➡ Indications

- Refractory to medical treatment
- Acute fulminant colitis with acute abdomen
  - ≥ 6 bloody stools/day + At least 1 of the following
    - Fever (37.8°C)/Tachycardia/ Anemia < 10.5 g/dL/Raised CRP
- Presence of complications including
  - Severe bleeding (unremitting bloody diarrhea)
  - Impeding or free perforation
  - Malignancy
  - Toxic megacolon
- Presence of debilitating extra-intestinal manifestation
  - Thromboembolic complications
    ➡ Predictors of colectomy
- BO > 12/day on D2 of IV steroid (Colectomy = 55%)
- BO > 8/day or BO 3 - 8/day + CRP > 45 on D3 IV steroid (Colectomy = 85%)
- (Stool frequency x 0.14 CRP) on D3 IV steroid ≥ 8 (Colectomy = 75%)
- Colonic dilatation > 5.5 cm (Colectomy = 75%)
- Ileus with ≥ 3 small bowel loops of gas (Colectomy = 73%)
- High CRP, low albumin and pH, ESR > 75, temp > 38°C on admission (5 - 9x)
  ➡ Surgical options (Open or laparoscopic)
- Emergency procedure (3-stage) = Total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy
  - Indicated in acutely ill patients
  - Diseased rectum is left-in-situ as rectum is an extraperitoneal organ and resection requires a long time
  - Foley catheter is used to decompress rectum for 3 - 4 days
  - Completion proctectomy with ileo-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) performed with diverting loop ileostomy later when the patient recovers and steroids have been withdrawn
  - Reversal of diverting loop ileostomy
- Elective procedure (2-stage) = Total proctocolectomy with ileo-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) and diverting loop ileostomy
  - Indicated in subacutely ill or stable patients (elective)
  - Ileo-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is in J-configuration
  - Standard of care in patients with UC who eventually require colectomy which can avoid long-term stoma
  - Followed by reversal of diverting loop ileostomy at later date
    ➡ Complications
- Pouchitis
  - Treated with metronidazole and ciprofloxacin
- Pouch-vaginal/perineal fistula
- Anastomotic stricture
- Anastomotic dehiscence with sepsis
- Sexual dysfunction/ Infertility

672

VII. Prognosis

1. Complications of ulcerative colitis
   ➡ Stricture

- Occurs due to repeated episodes of inflammation or muscle hypertrophy
- May cause symptoms of intestinal obstruction
- Should be considered malignant until proven otherwise by endoscopy with biopsy
  ➡ Fulminant colitis
- Patients present with > 10 stools per day, continuous bleeding, abdominal pain, distension and acute severe toxic symptoms including fever and anorexia
- High risk of developing toxic megacolon as inflammatory process extends beyond mucosa to involve muscle layers of the colon
  ➡ Toxic megacolon
- Total or segmental non-obstructive dilatation of colon ≥ 6 cm or cecum > 9 cm and the presence of systemic toxicity
- Presents with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances anemia, hypoalbuminemia and mental changes
- Diagnosis is made by plain AXR
- Management by bowel rest and total parenteral nutrition, fluid and electrolyte replacement and corticosteroids
  ➡ Perforation
- Most commonly occurs as a consequence of toxic megacolon
- Perforation with peritonitis is associated with high mortality
  ➡ Colorectal cancer (CRC)
- Patients with ulcerative colitis are at increased risk of CRC
- Regular endoscopic surveillance may be indicated in long-standing disease

2. Prognostic indicator
   ➡ Patient diagnosed before age 16 has a more aggressive initial course
   ➡ Patient diagnosed at older age is associated with a lower risk of colectomy

673

VIII. Prevention

1. Screening of colorectal cancer (CRC)
   ➡ American Gastroenterological Association (AGA guidelines)

- Colonoscopy after **8 years** in patients with pan-colitis (extensive disease)
- Colonoscopy after 15 years in patients with colitis involving left colon only (limited disease)
- Repeat colonoscopy every 1 – 2 years
- Ulcerative proctitis or proctosigmoiditis are **NOT** considered at increased risk and o not require regular surveillance endoscopy
- Surveillance colonoscopy should be performed when the disease is in remission ideally

➡ Methods for surveillance

- Chromoendoscopy
  - Highest yield for dysplasia detection
  - Involves topical application of methylene blue or indigo carmine to enhance mucosal irregularities and facilitate targeted biopsies
- High-definition white light colonoscopy
  - Alternative which also has high diagnostic yield for dysplasia
  - Preferred when chromoendoscopy yield is decreased or the mucosa is poorly visualized such as with inadequate preparation, active inflammation or in the setting of pseudopolyps and strictures
- Narrow band imaging (NBI)
  - Endoscope-based image-enhanced technology that enhances the fine structure of mucosa without the use of dyes
  - Does **NOT** enhance dysplasia detection

# Gastrointestinal Disease

## Colorectal cancer (CRC)

I. General features

1. Description
   - Mode of metastasis
     - **Mode** = Hematogenous/ Lymphatic/ Contiguous/Transperitoneal
     - **Site** = Regional LN/ Liver/ Lungs/ Peritoneum/ Bone/ Brain
       - Regional LN is the most common form of spread and usually precedes distant metastasis
       - Liver is usually the first site of metastasis since the venous drainage of intestinal tract is via the portal venous system
       - Lung can be the first site of metastasis for tumours in distal rectum since inferior rectal veins drains into IVC rather than portal venous system
   - Site of distribution
     - Majority of CRC are left-sided cancer
       - Ascending colon = 25%
       - Transverse colon = 10%
       - Descending colon = 15%
       - Sigmoid = 20%
       - Rectum = 30%

II. Epidemiology

1. Hong Kong's epidemiology
   - > 90% of CRC occurs in patients age ≥ 50
   - M: F ratio = 1.3: 1
   - Commonest cancer in Hong Kong
     - Accounts for 16.5% of all new cancer cases in 2013
   - 2nd leading cause of cancer death in both males and females

[Image Description: The image is a small number, 675, located at the bottom right corner of the page.]

### III. Hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes

1. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
   ➡General features

- Accounts for < 1% of colorectal cancer
- Autosomal dominant (AD) syndrome
  - Up to 25% present without other affected family members
- Variants include Gardner's syndrome, Turcot's syndrome and attenuated FAP
  - Gardner's syndrome = FAP associated with extracolonic manifestation
  - Turcot's syndrome = FAP associated with CNS tumours
  - Attenuated FAP = < 100 adenomatous colorectal polyps at presentation
    - Predominantly located in the right colon compared with classic FAP
    - APC gene mutation is only present in 30% of patients in attenuated FAP
- Caused by germline mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene on chromosome 5
  - APC gene is a tumour suppressor gene
  - APC mutation testing is positive in 75% of cases in patients with FAP
- Characterized by early age of onset
  - Polyp and symptoms appear at an average age of 16 (2nd – 3rd decades of life)
  - Colorectal cancer occurs in 90% of untreated individuals at the age of 45 and approaches ~100% by 50 years old
    ➡Clinical manifestation
- Colonic manifestation
  - Presence of > 100 adenomatous colorectal polyps
  - CRC are predominant left-sided in location
  - Adenoma in FAP is similar to sporadic adenoma in CRC and do NOT have a higher malignant potential
  - Increased risk of CRC is purely attributed to vast number of adenoma occurring at an early age
- Extra-colonic manifestation

➡ Diagnosis

- APC genetics testing of at-risk family members
- Colonoscopy showing > 100 polyps in addition to extra-colonic tumours of duodenum and pancreas (ampullary carcinoma)
  ➡ Surveillances
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 1 year (annual) starting at age 12
- OGD every 1-3 years starting at age 25
  - FAP patients are at risk of developing adenocarcinoma anywhere in GIT particularly in the duodenum
    ➡ Treatment
- Total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy
- Total proctocolectomy with ileal-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA)
  - Indicated in patients with profuse polyposis without much rectal sparing (> 10 rectal adenoma)
  - Indicated in patients with desmoid tumors since future conversion of IRA to IPAA might be difficult due to mesenteric desmoid tumors and shortening of the mesentery
  - IPAA is more extensive surgery as compared with IRA and is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and reduction in fertility in women
- Total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA)
  - Indicated if the rectum is relatively spared (< 10 rectal adenoma) provided the polyps can be managed endoscopically by colonoscopic snare excision
  - Subsequent close surveillance of retained rectum is crucial
  - Patients with an IRA who subsequently develop severe rectal polyposis will require a secondary proctectomy

2. Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)
   ➡General features

- **MOST** common inherited colorectal cancer syndrome
- Accounts for 3% of colorectal cancer and 2% of endometrial cancer
- Autosomal dominant (AD) syndrome
- HNPCC refers to patients or families who fulfill Amsterdam criteria for Lynch syndrome - Lynch syndrome refers to patients and family with a germline mutation in one of the
  DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes such as **MLH1** (90%), **MSH2**, **MSH6** (10%),
  EPCAM gene
- Approximately 70 – 80% of affected individuals will develop CRC
- Characterized by early age of onset - Mean age of colorectal cancer at age 40 – 45 with some presenting in their 20s
  ➡Clinical manifestation
- Colonic manifestation - CRC are predominantly right-sided in location - Arise from adenoma that tends to be larger, flatter and more likely to have high-grade
  dysplasia or villous histology compared with sporadic CRC - Adenoma-carcinoma sequence progresses much more rapidly
- Extra-colonic manifestation - GI: Gastric/Pancreas/ Biliary/ Small intestine - Gyn: Endometrial/ Ovarian - Uro: Renal/ Ureter - CNS: Brain (glioma) - Others: Sebaceous gland
  ➡Diagnostic criteria
- Amsterdam criteria (**3-2-1** rule)
  - **3** or more relatives with Lynch syndrome associated cancer
  - **2** or more successive generations should be affected
  - **1** or more cancers were diagnosed before age of 50
  - Familial adenomatous polyposis should be excluded in CRC
  - Tumour should be verified by pathological examination
- Revised Bethesda criteria (select patient at risk of HNPCC for MSI analysis) - CRC diagnosed in patient before age of 50 - CRC diagnosed in patient with one or more 1st degree relatives with HNPCC-related
  tumour with one of the cancer diagnosed before age of 50 - CRC diagnosed in patient with two or more 1st or 2nd degree relatives with HNPCC-
  related tumour regardless of age - Presence of synchronous, metachronous CRC, or other HNPCC-related tumours
  regardless of age - CRC with the MSI-H-like histology diagnosed before age of 60

# Pathophysiology

1. Vasculature of colon

[Image Description: Three separate images depict the colon and its blood supply and lymphatic drainage. The first image illustrates the arterial supply, showing the aorta branching into the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries, which supply the colon via the marginal artery of Drummond. Key vessels labeled include the middle colic artery, right colic artery, ileocolic artery, appendicular artery, and the arc of Riolan connecting the superior and inferior mesenteric systems. The image highlights the vascular network along the colon and its main arterial supply. The second image demonstrates the venous drainage of the colon, illustrating the portal vein receiving blood from the superior and inferior mesenteric veins, which drain the colon. Major veins labeled include the middle colic vein, right colic vein, ileocolic vein, left colic vein, and sigmoid veins. The third image illustrates the lymphatic drainage of the colon, showing a network of lymphatic vessels and nodes associated with the colon. Labeled nodes include middle colic nodes, epicolic nodes, paracolic nodes, superior mesenteric nodes (principal nodes), inferior mesenteric nodes (principal nodes), left colic nodes, paraaortic nodes, sigmoid nodes, cecal nodes, appendicular nodes, internal iliac nodes, middle rectal nodes, inferior rectal nodes, and nodes leading to the inguinal region.]

2. Anatomy of rectum

VI. Pathogenesis

1. Chromosomal instability pathway
   ➡Adenoma-carcinoma sequence (60-70% of sporadic cancer)

- **MOST** colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps by accumulation of mutations in what has come to be known as adenoma-carcinoma sequence
  - Colorectal polyps are either adenomatous or hyperplastic
  - Adenomatous polyps accounts for 2/3 of cases of colorectal polyps and villous adenomas has a greater risk than tubular adenomas to develop CRC
    - Tubular adenomas are associated with malignancy in up to 5%
    - **Villous** adenomas are associated with malignancy in up to 40%
    - Tubulovillous adenomas are associated with malignancy in up to 22%
  - Hyperplastic polyps accounts for 1/3 of cases of colorectal polyps and are **NOT** pre-malignant except for rare syndrome known as hyperplastic polyposis
- Some colonic carcinoma arises from non-polypoid adenomas that are flat or depressed
- Neoplastic change result from both inherited and acquired genetic defects
  - Progresses from small to large (> 1 cm) polyps followed by dysplasia and cancer
  - Progression from adenoma to carcinoma takes at least 10 years on average
    ➡ Activation of oncogenes
- _K-ras gene:_ K-ras is a signaling molecule in the EGFR pathway which will lead to uncontrolled cell division
  - Other EGFR signaling molecule such as BRAF have also been implicated in CRC pathogenesis and progression
    ➡ Inactivation of tumour suppressor genes
- _APC gene:_ Mutations in both alleles are necessary to initiate polyp formation and majority of mutations are premature stop codons which result in truncated APC protein
  - APC inactivation alone does not result in carcinoma but instead it sets the stage for accumulation of genetic damage that results in malignancy
- _p53 gene:_ Initiate apoptosis in cells with irreparable genetic damage
  ➡ Other genes involved
- _MYH gene:_ Base excision repair gene

2. Microsatellite instability pathway (MSI) (15% of sporadic cancer)
   ➡ Many of the remaining CRC are thought to arise from mutations in MSI pathway

- First recognized in HNPCC (Lynch syndrome) but are now recognized to be present in many sporadic tumors
  ➡Characterized by errors in mismatch repair during DNA replication
- Number of genes have been identified that appear to be crucial for recognizing and repairing DNA replication errors
  - Includes MSH2, MLH1, PMS1, PMS2, MSH6/GTBP
  - Mutations in one of these genes predispose a cell to mutations which may occur in protooncogenes or tumor suppressor genes
  - Accumulation of these errors lead to genomic instability and ultimately to carcinogenesis
    ➡ Microsatellites are regions of the genome in which short base-pair segments are repeated several times, regions that are particularly prone to replication error
- Consequently, a mutation in the mismatch repair gene produces variable lengths of these repetitive sequences, a finding known as microsatellite instability (MSI)

=> Summary of TNM staging

- Stage I = Tumour that is invasive through the muscularis mucosae but are confined to the submucosa (T1) or muscularis propria (T2) in the ABSENCE of nodal metastasis
- Stage II = Tumour that invades through bowel wall into Subserosa or non-peritonealized pericolic or perirectal tissues (T3) or into other organs or tissues or through the visceral peritoneum (T4) in the ABSENCE of nodal metastasis
- Stage III = Presence of nodal metastasis with any T stage
- Stage IV = Presence of distant metastasis
  =>Duke's staging
- Older staging system being replaced by TNM staging
  - Duke's A = Tumour within wall of the bowel
  - Duke's B = Tumour invades through the wall of bowel
  - Duke's C = Presence of regional LN metastasis
  - Duke's D = Presence of distant metastasis

[Image: This is a representation of the TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) staging system for cancer, along with Duke's staging. The TNM staging is presented in a table format, showing the different stages (0, I, II, III, IV) and their corresponding T (tumor size and extent), N (lymph node involvement), and M (distant metastasis) classifications. Duke's staging is described as an older system being replaced by TNM staging, with its stages (A, B, C, D) related to the depth of tumor invasion and lymph node involvement. The image presents the staging criteria in a clear and organized manner, suitable for medical professionals.]

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (Late presentation due to less symptomatic)                                                                                                    | (Early presentation due to more symptomatic)                                            |

IX. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Pallor
- Jaundice
- Lymphadenopathy (supraclavicular)
  ➡Abdominal examination
- Hepatomegaly
- Ascites
  ➡Digital rectal examination
- Per rectal bleeding
- Rectal masses

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differential

- Anemia
  ➡ Iron profile
- Iron deficiency anemia
  ➡Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
- Low diagnostic ability due to low specificity and low sensitivity for early-stage disease
  - Serum level can be normal in 30 – 40% of patients in early disease
  - Serum level elevated usually in advanced disease
- **NOT** recommended as a screening or diagnostic test for colorectal cancer
- Clinical significance
  - Pre-operative checkup to facilitate surgical planning
  - Post-operative follow-up to detect recurrence or metastasis
  - Assessment of prognosis
    ➡ Molecular profiling for microsatellite instability (MSI)/ deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR)
- CRCs with MSI/ dMMR status have a distinct phenotype including
  - Predilection for the proximal (right-sided) colon
  - Poor differentiation
  - Better prognosis in terms of stage-adjusted survival
  - Respond differently to 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy

689

3. Radiological tests
   ➡ Colonoscopy

- Most accurate and can localize and biopsy lesions through the large bowels
- Majority of colon and rectal cancers are endoluminal masses arising from mucosa and
  protruding into lumen with exophytic or polypoid appearance
- Bleeding may be seen in lesions that are friable, necrotic or ulcerated
  ➡CT colonography
- Also known as virtual colonoscopy which refers to computer-simulated endoluminal
  perspective of the air-filled distended colon
- Indicated in incomplete colonoscopy due to mechanical obstruction or patient's intolerance
  ➡Barium enema/ Gastrografin (water-soluble) contrast enema
- Indicated when colonoscopy is unsuccessful due to intestinal obstruction
- Double-contrast barium enema is used (DCBE)
- "Apple-core" appearance indicating circumferential or near-circumferential involvement of
  bowel walls

4. Staging evaluation
   ⇨CXR
   ➡CT chest + abdomen + pelvis (T + A + P)

- CT abdomen and pelvis to demonstrate tumour extension, regional lymphatic and distant
  metastasis and tumour-related complications such as obstruction, perforation and fistula
  formation
- CT chest to assess possible metastasis to lungs particularly from rectal cancer
- MRI liver is useful if there are concerning hepatic lesions on CT scan
  ➡Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)\*
- Integral part of staging rectal tumors to evaluate depth of invasion, circumferential resection
  margin (CRM) and LN status to determine need of neoadjuvant chemoradiation
- Pretreatment staging of rectal cancer often relies on endorectal USG to determine the t and N
  status of a rectal cancer
- Distinguish localized cancer that involve only the mucosa and submucosa from those that
  penetrate the muscularis propria or extend transmurally into perirectal fat
  ➡MRI rectum\*
- NOT routinely indicated for colon cancer
- **IMPORTANT** in **ALL** rectal cancer for tumour staging to determine whether neoadjuvant
  chemoradiation is indicated - MRI is useful to assess mesorectal involvement - MRI is superior to CT in delineating the fat planes for T staging of rectal cancer - When the radial margin is threatened or involved then neoadjuvant chemoradiation is
  recommended - T3/4 or N1 cancers should receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation before surgery due to
  high risk of recurrence after surgery itself
  ➡Positron emission tomography (PET) scan
- FDG is used in patients with CRC
- Indicated in patients with distant metastasis or tumour recurrence - Localizing site of recurrence in patients with rising CEA level and non-diagnostic
  conventional imaging evaluation following primary treatment - Localize occult disease permits selection of patients for exploratory laparotomy
  690

X. **Treatment (Medical)**

1. Predictive biomarkers
   ➡KRAS screening

- KRAS mutation status is an important biomarker for EGFR-targeted therapies in metastatic colorectal cancer
- Wild-type KRAS has a favorable response to cetuximab or panitumumab
- Mutant KRAS will **NOT** benefit from cetuximab or panitumumab and lead to unnecessary adverse events (cutaneous reactions (e.g. rash/ pruritus/ nail changes), headache, diarrhea and infection) - KRAS mutation results in constitutive activation of RAS-RAF-ERK pathway leading to resistance to anti-EGFR therapy
  ➡BRAF screening
- KRAS and BRAF mutations are mutually exclusive
- Mutant BRAF is unlikely to benefit from cetuximab or panitumumab

2. Medical treatment
   ➡Cytotoxic chemotherapy backbone

- Indicated for all stage III and high-risk stage II disease
  - High-risk features include T4 stage, poorly-differentiated type, lymphovascular or perineural invasion, inadequate LN dissection or positive resection margin
- Chemotherapy doublet containing either 5-fluorouracil/ leucovorin (5-FU) (OR) capecitabine (Xeloda) + oxaliplatin (OR) irinotecan
  - Oxaliplatin: Alkylating agent
  - Irinotecan: Topoisomerase I inhibitor
  - Fluorouracil: Anti-metabolite (Pyrimidine analog)
  - Capecitabine: Anti-metabolite (Pyrimidine analog)
- Adverse effects of chemotherapy - Mucositis/ Nausea and vomiting/Diarrhea/ Febrile neutropenia/ Alopecia/ Hand-foot syndrome (especially capecitabine)
  ➡Bevacizumab (OR) Aflibercept (OR) Regorafenib
- Monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF-A
- **ONLY** indicated in stage IV (metastatic) disease and there is no evidence to support use of targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting
- Added to cytotoxic chemotherapy backbone particularly for patients with KRAS and BRAF mutations when anti-EGFR are contraindicated
- Contraindications (similar to its side effects) - Hemorrhage - Wound healing - Arterial thromboembolic diseases
  ➡Cetuximab (OR) Panitumumab
- Monoclonal antibody against EGFR
- **ONLY** indicated in stage IV (metastatic) disease and there is no evidence to support use of targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting
- Added to cytotoxic chemotherapy backbone that is irinotecan-based particularly for patients with wild-type KRAS and BRAF
- Side effects
  - Acneiform rash/ Diarrhea/ Electrolyte disturbance (Hypomagnesemia)

XI. Surgical treatment (Colon cancer)

1. Overview
   ➡Goal of resection

- Complete removal of tumour with adequate proximal and distal margin
  Ο Proximal and distal resection margins should be at least 5 cm from the tumour
  Ο En bloc resection of contiguous structures if there is attachment or infiltration of
  tumour into potentially resectable organ or structure
- High ligation of arterial pedicle for LN clearance
- Tension-free anastomosis
- Good blood supply to the ensuing anastomosis or stoma
  ➡Number of LN recovered in surgical specimen has long served as a proxy for the oncologic
  adequacy of resection
- A minimum of 12 lymph nodes in the resected specimen are necessary for adequate staging
  ➡Stage-specific treatment
- Stage I = Surgical resection ± Adjuvant chemotherapy
  Ο Adjuvant chemotherapy does not improve survival
- Stage II = Surgical resection ± Adjuvant chemotherapy
  Ο Adjuvant chemotherapy does not improve survival
  Ο Adjuvant chemotherapy can be considered in selected patients with Stage II disease
  including young patients, inadequate LN retrieval (<12) or tumours with "high-risk"
  histological findings
- Stage III Surgical resection + Adjuvant chemotherapy
  Ο Adjuvant chemotherapy is routinely given since patients with LN involvement are at
  significant risk of both local and distant recurrence
  Ο Use of chemotherapy improves survival in this group of patients
  Ο Note that patients with MSI-high stage III disease do NOT benefit from
  chemotherapy and therefore molecular profiling can help patients safely avoid
  systemic chemotherapy
- Stage IV = Resection in highly selected patients + Adjuvant chemotherapy/ Palliative
  procedures
  Ο Liver metastasis - 20% of metastasis confined to the liver are potentially resectable for cure - 5-year survival rate improves from 20% to 40% after resection - ALL patients require adjuvant chemotherapy
  Ο Lung metastasis - 1-2% of lung metastasis are potentially resectable for cure - Long-term survival benefit is approximate 30 - 40%
  Ο Palliative care will be the focus of treatment for unresectable cases - Colonic stenting/ Diverting stoma/ Bypass surgery for obstruction - Angiographic embolization for hemorrhage - External beam irradiation

2. Preoperative preparation
   ➡Bowel preparation

- Mechanical bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol solution
  ➡IV antibiotic prophylaxis
- Significantly decreases wound infections
  ⇨ Thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated or LMW heparin for moderate-to-high risk patients

➡Different types of colectomy

- Lesions in the cecum and ascending colon should be resected via right colectomy
- Lesions in the descending and sigmoid colon should be resected via left colectomy
- Lesions in the transverse colon are typically resected using an extended right colectomy

➡Open VS laparoscopic colectomy

- Colectomy can be approached laparoscopically, open or robotically
- Laparoscopic colectomy is preferred for patients with uncomplicated localized colorectal cancer who have not had prior extensive abdominal surgery
  - Tattoo should be placed in the area of tumour at time of endoscopy so it can be reliably identified at colectomy
- Open colectomy is preferred for patients with complicated colorectal cancer

| Open                    | Laparoscopic               | Robotic                              |

➡Choice of resection

- Benign lesions
  - Typically removed using segmental colectomy or left or right hemicolectomy
  - Diverticular disease is classically treated with sigmoidectomy but may require left hemicolectomy if descending colon is unsuitable for anastomosis
  - Mesenteric vessels can be divided and ligated close to the mesenteric border of colon since it is unnecessary to resect draining lymph node
- Malignant lesions
  - Lesions in cecum, appendix and ascending colon is treated by right hemicolectomy
  - Lesions in hepatic flexure or proximal to mid-transverse colon is treated by extended right hemicolectomy
  - Lesions in distal transverse colon, splenic flexure or descending colon is treated by left hemicolectomy
  - Lesion in sigmoid colon is treated by sigmoidectomy
  - Complete mesocolic resection with ligation of mesenteric vessels close to their origin to optimally resect the lymphovascular tissue
- Malignant polyp - Certain characteristics of polyps are associated with increased incidence of residual cancer or lymphatic spread and thus requires radical resection - Features include poorly differentiated histology, lymphovascular invasion, cancer at resection or stalk margin, invasion into muscularis propria (T2 lesion), sessile polyp with lower third submucosal penetration
  695

➡Bowel anastomosis

- Primary anastomosis **without** temporary proximal diverting ostomy in uncomplicated cases
  - Can be safely performed in right or extended right hemicolectomy since right and transverse colon have low bacterial counts
- Primary anastomosis **with** temporary proximal diverting ostomy in complicated cases (e.g. obstruction, perforation, localized peritonitis)
  - Proximal diverting ostomy include loop ileostomy, loop colostomy or end ostomy
  - Left-sided lesion is preferably managed with left hemicolectomy with proximal diverting colostomy due to higher risk of anastomotic leakage
  - Does **NOT** decrease rate of anastomotic leakage
  - Decreases complication rate and risk of reoperation in cases of anastomotic leakage
- Primary anastomosis is **NOT** performed in cases of diffuse peritonitis, free perforation or if the patient is medically unstable

Remarks: QMH has demonstrated that there is no statistically significant difference in hospital mortality or anastomotic leak rate among patients who underwent resection and primary anastomosis regardless of tumour location (left-sided VS right-sided) and thus patients with left-sided lesion can also be safely managed with a one-stage procedure

4. Complications
   ➡General complications (Early < 30 days)

- Surgical site infection
- Postoperative ileus
  ➡Intra-abdominal complications (Immediate)
- GI: Splenic/ Duodenal/Pancreatic/ Gastric injury
- UG: Ureteral/ Bladder/ Urethral injury
  ➡Anastomotic complications
- Bleeding (Early < 30 days)
  - Management include blood transfusion and correction of underlying coagulopathy
- Leakage (Early < 30 days)
  - Can be classified into intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal leakage
  - Becomes apparent 5-7 days postoperatively
  - Clinical signs include pain, fever, tachycardia, feculent or purulent drainage
  - Radiological signs include fluid or gas containing collections
  - Management include fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, bowel
    rest, image-guided percutaneous drainage of abscess, temporary fecal diversion or
    drainage or resection of the anastomosis
- Stricture (Late > 30 days)
  - Majority of patients does not require intervention
  - Remaining patients requiring intervention can be treated with finger dilatation for low
    anastomosis and endoscopic balloon dilatation for high anastomosis
- Fistula (Late > 30 days) - Enterocutaneous (colocutaneous), rectovaginal (colovaginal), and rectourinary
  fistula can occur following colorectal surgery - Enterocutaneous fistula can be managed conservation since most will close
  spontaneously without operative intervention
  - Rectovaginal or rectourinary fistula should be managed with proximal fecal diversion
    ➡Stoma complications
- Early complications (Early < 30 days)
  - Stomal bleeding
  - Stomal necrosis
  - Stomal retraction
  - Mucocutaneous separation
  - Skin irritation and dermatitis (most common in end and loop ileostomy due to high-
    output and high alkaline enzymatic effluent)
- Late complications (Late > 30 days)
  - Parastomal hernia
  - Stomal prolapse
  - Stomal stenosis
    [Image: a page break/separator]

5. Postoperative FU and surveillance
   ➡Postoperative management

- Early postoperative feeding
- Early ambulation
- Lifestyle modification
  - Avoid strenuous activity and heavy lifting for 4 - 6 weeks
  - Return to hospital if unexpected symptoms arise or presence of wound infection
    ➡FU and surveillance
- Patients treated for CRC are at risk of development of recurrent disease (either locally or systemically) or metachronous disease (a second primary tumour)
- Recurrence usually occur within 2 years of original diagnosis and surveillance should focus on this time period
  - Colonoscopy every 3 - 6 months for 3 years then every 6 months for 2 years
  - CEA every 3-6 months for 2 years

XII. Surgical treatment (Rectal cancer)

1. Overview
   ➡Difference between colon and rectal cancer

- +ve: Transanal accessibility is possible
  Ο Distal 10 cm of rectum are accessible transanally
- +ve: Easier to treat with neoadjuvant radiotherapy due to the relative paucity of small bowel and other radiation-sensitive structures in the pelvis (unlike intraperitoneal colon)
- -ve: Confinement to pelvis and presence of sphincter makes wide excision impossible
- -ve: Proximity to urogenital structures and nerves (bladder/ ureter/ prostate/ vagina/ iliac vessels/ sacrum) makes resection more challenging and often requires a different approach
- -ve: More difficult to achieve negative radial margins in rectal cancers that extend through the bowel wall because of anatomical limitation of pelvis
  ➡Principles of surgical treatment
- Adequate circumferential margin should be achieved
  - Narrow distal margin (2 cm) is adequate provided total mesorectal excision (TME) is performed
- Total mesorectal excision (TME)
- Lymph node clearance with high ligation of the arterial pedicle (IMA)
- Sphincter and autonomic nerve preservation
  - Consideration of continence and urogenital function
    ➡Neoadjuvant chemoradiation
- Advantages
  - Tumour downstaging by treating locally involved lymph nodes
  - Tumour shrinkage to increase likelihood of resection and a sphincter-sparing procedure
  - Associated with similar results but significant less toxicity than postoperative chemotherapy
- Disadvantages
  Ο Overtreatment of early stage tumours
  - Impaired wound healing
  - Increase postoperative complications
  - Pelvic fibrosis

699

➡Stage-specific treatment

- Stage I (T1-2; N0; M0) = Local excision/ Radical resection
  - Low-risk or refuse radical resection = Local excision
    - Local excision may be adequate but strong consideration should be given to adjuvant chemoradiation
    - Refusal of radical resection due to permanent colostomy
  - High-risk and accept radical resection = Radical resection
    - Local recurrence rate is high with 20% and 40% for T1 and T2 cancer and therefore radical resection is recommended in all good-risk patients
- Stage II (T3-4; N0; M0) = Neoadjuvant chemoradiation + Radical resection
- Stage III (T any; N1; M0) = Neoadjuvant chemoradiation + Radical resection
  - Adjuvant chemoradiation can be considered to improve local control and survival
  - Advances in surgical technique such as TME has improve local control with surgery alone prompting some to abandon adjuvant chemoradiation
- Stage IV (T any; N any; M0) = Resection in highly selected patients + Adjuvant chemotherapy/ Chemoradiation/ Palliative procedures
  - Isolated liver or lung metastasis can be resected for cure in selected patients
  - Palliative care will be the focus of treatment for unresectable cases
    - Endoluminal stenting/ Diverting stoma/ Bypass surgery for obstruction
    - Local therapy using cautery or laser ablation for hemorrhage

Remarks: Radical resection = Anterior resection/ Abdominal perineal resection (APR)

2. Surgical principles
   ➡ Selection of surgical treatment
   - **Tumour** factor
     - Size of tumour
     - Location of tumour from anal verge (define upper, middle and lower cancer)
     - Location of tumour from anorectal ring (whether sphincter-sparing is feasible)
     - Presence of lymph node metastasis
     - Presence of invasion into lateral pelvic walls and other intraabdominal organs
   - **Patient** factor
     - Fitness of patient whether or not transabdominal surgery is tolerable
     - Pre-surgical anorectal sphincter function
     - Pelvic anatomy of patient
   - **Surgeon** factor - Experience of surgeon - Hospital equipment
     ➡ Resection margins
   - Proximal margin
     - Minimum -ve proximal margin of 5 cm is required
   - Distal margin
     - Compromise between oncological safety and maximizing sphincter preservation to select the appropriate distal margin
     - Failure to achieve -ve distal margin is an indication to convert from sphincter-sparing procedure to abdominal peritoneal resection (APR)
     - Minimum -ve distal margin in cancer above distal mesorectal margin = 2 cm
     - Minimum -ve distal margin in cancer at or below distal mesorectal margin = 1 cm
   - Circumferential radial margin (CRM)
     - Minimum CRM of 1 mm is required

| Radical excision | Sphincter-sparing ➡Anterior resection AR Low AR Non-sphincter- sparing            | ➡Abdominal perineal resection (APR) ➡Multivisceral resection Pelvic exenteration | √   |

Remarks: Mesorectal excision is intrinsically included in APR

➡ Total mesorectal excision (TME)

- Standard TME is performed transabdominally with open, laparoscopic or robotic technique
- Applies to all radical resections for rectal cancer
- Precise sharp dissection in the avascular plane between visceral and parietal layers of endopelvic fascia to ensure complete removal of rectal mesentery (perirectal areolar tissues)
  - Removal of lateral and circumferential margins of the mesorectal envelop to a level of 5 cm below distal margin or primary tumour (for upper rectum tumour) or to the pelvic floor (for middle or lower rectum tumour)
  - Removal of blood supply and regional LN dissection up to the level of origin of superior rectal artery (i.e. high ligation at IMA)
- Replaces the conventional blunt dissection as the standard technique of removing perirectal tissue when performing radical rectal cancer surgery (sphincter-sparing or APR)
  - Conventional blunt dissection has risk of violating the mesorectal envelop and leave behind residual tumour in pelvis
  - Conventional blunt dissection may violate the presacral plane leading to life-threatening hemorrhage
- Rationale of TME
  - Rectal cancer cells can spread within mesorectum and TME is performed to ensure adequate negative CRM and complete removal of all draining lymphatics
- Benefits of TME
  - Improves long-term survival
  - Reduces local recurrence rates
    - Improved clearance of tumour deposits in the mesentery and a decreased risk of disrupting mesentery and spilling tumour cells during dissection
  - Less blood loss and less risk to the pelvic nerves and presacral plexus compared with blunt dissection
    - ↓ Post-operative genitourinary dysfunction due to pelvic autonomic nerve preservation

➡Defunctioning stoma creation
• Temporary diverting stoma such as loop ileostomy (preferred) or loop
colostomy can be used to protect an anastomosis
• Does **NOT** decrease rate of anastomotic leakage
• Decreases complication rate (fecal peritonitis) and risk of reoperation in
cases of anastomotic leakage
• Indications
○ Low anastomosis in which manipulation of colon deep within
pelvic cavity leads to increase risk of anastomotic leakage and
poorer blood supply to anastomosis
○ Anastomosis is under tension
○ Intraoperative leak test is positive
Outcomes ➡ Outcomes of anterior resection
• Similar local recurrence rate as abdominal perineal resection (APR)

4. Complications
   ➡ General complications (Early < 30 days)

- Surgical site infection
- Postoperative ileus
  ➡ Intra-abdominal complications (Immediate)
- Anterior resection syndrome
  - Fecal frequency, urgency, clustering or incontinence
- GI: Splenic/ Duodenal/ Pancreatic/ Gastric injury
- UG: Ureteral/ Bladder/ Urethral injury
  ➡ Anastomotic complications
- Bleeding (Early < 30 days)
  - Management include blood transfusion and correction of underlying coagulopathy
- Leakage (Early < 30 days)
  - Can be classified into intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal leakage
  - Becomes apparent 5 – 7 days postoperatively
  - Clinical signs include pain, fever, tachycardia, feculent or purulent drainage
  - Radiological signs include fluid or gas containing collections
  - Management include fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, bowel
    rest, image-guided percutaneous drainage of abscess, temporary fecal diversion or
    drainage or resection of the anastomosis
- Stricture (Late > 30 days)
  - Majority of patients does not require intervention
  - Remaining patients requiring intervention can be treated with finger dilatation for low
    anastomosis and endoscopic balloon dilatation for high anastomosis
- Fistula (Late > 30 days)
  - Enterocutaneous (colocutaneous), rectovaginal (colovaginal), and rectourinary
    fistula can occur following colorectal surgery
  - Enterocutaneous fistula can be managed conservation since most will close
    spontaneously without operative intervention
  - Rectovaginal or rectourinary fistula should be managed initially with proximal fecal
    diversion
    ➡ Stoma complications
- Early complications (Early < 30 days)
  - Stomal bleeding
  - Stomal necrosis
  - Stomal retraction
  - Mucocutaneous separation
  - Skin irritation and dermatitis (most common in end and loop ileostomy due to high-
    output and high alkaline enzymatic effluent)
- Late complications (Late > 30 days)
  - Parastomal hernia
  - Stomal prolapse
  - Stomal stenosis

XIII. Prevention

1. Protective factors
   ➡Physical activity

- Perform ≥ 150 mins of physical activity per week
  ➡Dietary changes
- ↑ Intake of dietary fibers (e.g. whole-grains, beans, fruits and vegetables)
- ↓ Intake of red and processed meat (e.g. sausage, ham, bacon and luncheon meat)
  ➡Avoid alcohol
  ➡Avoid smoking
  ⇨ Drugs
- Aspirin
- NSAIDS

XIV. Screening

1. General principles
   ➡Wilson and Jungner criteria
   (1) The condition sought should be an important health problem
   (2) There should be an accepted treatment for patients with recognized disease
   (3) Facilities for diagnosis and treatment should be available
   (4) There should be a recognizable latent or early asymptomatic stage
   (5) There should be a suitable test or examination
   (6) The test should be acceptable to the population
   (7) The natural history of the condition, including development from latent to declared disease should be adequately understood
   (8) There should be an agreed policy on whom to treat as patients
   (9) Cost of case-finding (including diagnosis and treatment of patients diagnosed) should be economically balanced in relation to possible expenditure on medical care as a whole
   (10) Case-finding should be a continuing process and not a "once and for all" projects
   ➡ Background

- Slow transition from polyps to CRC allows opportunities to prevent cancer death by finding and removing polyps and to prevent cancer death by finding and removing early cancers
- Stool-based tests
  - Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT)
  - Fecal immunochemical test (FIT)
  - Fecal DNA test
- Direct visualization tests
  - Colonoscopy
  - Flexible sigmoidoscopy
  - Capsule endoscopy
  - CT colonography (colonic imaging)

2. Colorectal screening strategies
   ➡Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT)

- Background
  - Guaiac testing of stool samples identifies Hb by the presence of a peroxidase reaction which turns the guaiac-impregnated paper blue
  - Guaiac reagents available on marker includes Hemoccult-SENSA (preferred)/ Hemoccult/Hemoccult-II/ Hemoccult-R
  - ALL positive initial screening result will require a follow-up colonoscopy
- Test procedures
  - Screening by gFOBT should be performed on 3 consecutive stool specimens
  - Restrictive diet is NOT necessary as it decreases screening compliance
  - Vitamin C should be restricted for at least 3 days prior to sampling as it leads to false negative (FN) results
- Test performance

➡Fecal immunochemical tests (FIT)

- Background
  - Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for Hb are more specific than guaiac test because they detect only human globin and thus do NOT detect upper GI bleeding since the globin is digested during the transit (more specific to lower GI bleeding)
  - Food with peroxidase activity also do not produce a positive reaction
  - ALL positive initial screening result will require a follow-up colonoscopy
- Test procedures
  - Only 1 stool sample is required for automated analysis
  - Sensitivity of test decreases with mailing, delayed processing after sampling and exposure to high ambient temperature due to Hb degradation
  - Test is usually conducted annually
- Advantages and disadvantages

Fecal DNA

- Background
  - Genetic mutations and epigenetic changes acquired during carcinogenesis can be detected in stool from DNA shed by colorectal neoplasm
  - Newer tests (Cologuard) combines testing stool for DNA mutations and methylation markers using a gene amplification technique and testing for Hb with FIT
  - ALL positive initial screening result will require a follow-up colonoscopy
- Test procedures
  - Individuals collect a full stool sample which is submitted in a collection kit to the laboratory for testing
  - Optimal interval between screening fecal DNA test is every 3 years

➡Sigmoidoscopy

- Background
  - The 60 cm sigmoidoscopy can reach to splenic flexure and can only identify left-sided colonic lesions
  - Small lesion can be biopsied during the procedure but large lesion still requires colonoscopy for complete excision
  - Usually paired with air-contrast barium enema to detect transverse and right-sided colonic lesions
  - Most important complication of sigmoidoscopy is perforation
- Test procedures
  - Recommended every 5 years when performed alone or every 10 years if performed along with FOBT or fecal immunochemical test (FIT)
  - Follow-up colonoscopy is indicated of multiple or large adenomas (≥ 1.0 cm) and for adenomas with villous histology

- RAS and BRAF mutation

2. **Prognosis according to TNM staging**
   ➡5-year survival of colon cancer

- Stage I = 90%
- Stage II = 60 – 80%
- Stage III = 60%
- Stage IV = 10%
  [Image Description: The image is a scanned page from a medical textbook or notes, outlining prognostic factors and staging for a specific type of cancer, possibly colorectal cancer (CRC). The page is numbered 712 in the bottom right corner. It is divided into two main sections: "Prognostic Determinants" and "Prognosis according to TNM staging". The first section lists factors such as tumor extent, regional nodes involvement (with specific details on the impact of nodal involvement and T stage), lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, grade of differentiation, and molecular factors. The second section provides 5-year survival rates based on TNM staging, ranging from Stage I (90% survival) to Stage IV (10% survival). The page uses a combination of headings, bullet points, and indentation to organize the information.]

## Intestinal (Bowel) ischemia

I. Overview

1.  General features
    ➡ Intestinal ischemia can be caused by any process that reduces intestinal blood flow
    ➡ Leads to transmural necrosis of bowel wall and can progress to sepsis, peritonitis, free
    intraabdominal air, bowel infarction, gangrene or even death
    ➡ Classification according to segment of bowel that is affected

- Small bowel ischemia = Mesenteric ischemia
- Large bowel ischemia = Colonic ischemia
  ➡ Classification according to time course of onset
- Acute mesenteric ischemia
  o Sudden onset of small intestinal hypoperfusion due to occlusive or non-occlusive
  obstruction of arterial supply or venous outflow
- Chronic mesenteric ischemia
  o Develops in patients with mesenteric atherosclerosis
  o Leads to episodic intestinal hypoperfusion related to eating

II. Pathogenesis

1.  Physiology of ischemia
    ➡ Normal physiology

- Splanchnic circulation receives 10-35% of cardiac output depending upon whether it is
  in the fasted or postprandial state
- Intrinsic autoregulation of blood flow helps to redirect blood from the gut to the brain
  during periods of systemic hypotension
- Capillary density within intestinal vasculature is high compared to other vascular beds but
  intestinal oxygen extraction is relatively low
  o Permits sufficient oxygen to be delivered to liver via portal vein
  ➡ Response to ischemia
- Intestinal blood flow must be reduced by > 50% from the normal fasting level before
  oxygen delivery to the intestines become compromised
  o Intestine is able to compensate for ~75% reduction in mesenteric blood flow for
  up to 12 hours without substantial injury by vasodilation and increased oxygen
  extraction of collateral circulation
- Intestinal injury is caused by both ischemic and reperfusion injury
  o Ischemic injury to intestines develop when there is insufficient delivery of oxygen
  and nutrients required for cellular metabolism (tissue hypoxia)
  o Reperfusion injury occurs following restoration of blood flow after a period of
  ischemia
- Prolonged period of ischemia
- Progressive vasoconstriction develops in the obstructed vascular bed increasing its
  pressure and reducing collateral flow
- Vasoconstriction persists even after blood flow has been restored
  o Persistent ischemia can lead to full-thickness necrosis of bowel wall and
  subsequent perforation

2. Intestinal vascular anatomy

[Detailed anatomical illustration of the intestinal vascular system, featuring both arterial and venous structures. The image is divided into two sections, one showing the arterial supply in red and the other showing the venous drainage in blue. The arterial side highlights the superior mesenteric artery and its branches, including the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery, middle colic artery, right colic artery, and ileocolic artery, as well as the jejunal and ileal arteries supplying the small intestine. The venous side shows the portal vein receiving blood from the superior mesenteric vein, splenic vein, and inferior mesenteric vein. Branches like the pancreaticoduodenal veins, middle colic vein, right colic vein, and ileocolic vein are also displayed, along with jejunal and ileal veins. The colon's arterial supply from the right, middle, and left colic arteries is visible, mirroring the venous drainage. The marginal artery of Drummond connects the superior and inferior mesenteric systems. The inferior mesenteric artery and its branches, including the left colic and sigmoid arteries, are shown supplying the descending and sigmoid colon. The superior, middle, and inferior rectal arteries and veins are also highlighted in the pelvis. Overall, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the blood supply and drainage of the intestines.]

➡**Arterial** supply to intestine consist of SMA and IMA

- SMA supplies the entire small intestine **EXCEPT** proximal duodenum
- SMA and IMA both supply the colon
  ➡**Venous** drainage parallels arterial circulation
- Drains into portal venous system

714

[Anatomical drawing of the arterial blood supply to the colon and rectum, showing the celiac axis at the top, with the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries, the middle colic artery, superior mesenteric artery, inferior mesenteric artery, superior rectal artery, left colic artery, internal iliac arteries and middle rectal arteries. Also labeled are marginal artery of Drummond and Arc of Riolan.]

➡ Collateral circulation

- Collateral circulation protects intestines from transient periods of inadequate perfusion
- Prolonged reduction in splanchnic blood flow leads to vasoconstriction in the affected vascular bed and eventually reduces collateral blood flow
- SMA and IMA communicate via marginal artery of Drummond and meandering mesenteric artery (Arc of Riolan)
  - Marginal artery of Drummond: Major collateral arcade and is composed of branches from right, middle and left colic arteries located within the mesentery of colon and runs the entire length of colon lying adjacent to colonic wall
  - Meandering mesenteric artery: Inconstant communication between SMA and IMA also known as Arc of Riolan or central communicating artery
- SMA and celiac axis communicate principally through junction of superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries with presence of several small conduits
  - Gastric ischemia is rare due to rich collaterals around the stomach
- IMA and systemic circulation has collaterals in the rectum as the superior rectal vessels merge with middle rectal vessels from internal iliac arteries
  ➡ Areas prone to ischemia with limited collateralization ("watershed" areas)
- Splenic flexure
  - Narrow terminal branches of SMA supply the splenic flexure
  - Marginal artery of Drummond is very small and may be devoid of vasa recta in some group of patients
  - Griffiths' point = Site of communication of marginal artery of Drummond to ascending left colic artery and the anastomotic bridging between left and right terminal branches of ascending left colic artery at splenic flexure which is a critical area of weakness of blood supply
- Rectosigmoid junction
  - Narrow terminal branches of IMA supply the rectosigmoid junction
  - Sudeck's point = Site of descending branch of left colic artery forms anastomosis with superior rectal artery
    715

III. Etiology

1. Causes of ischemia
   ➡**Arterial embolism** (50%)

- Embolism to mesenteric arteries is most frequently due to dislodged thrombus from LA, LV, cardiac valves or proximal aorta
- Atrial fibrillation (AF) may predispose to arterial embolism

➡**Arterial thrombosis** (15 – 25%)

- Thrombosis of the mesenteric circulation usually occurs as a superimposed phenomenon in patients with history of chronic intestinal ischemia from atherosclerotic diseases
- Can occur in the setting of abdominal infection, thrombosed mesenteric aneurysm, aortic or mesenteric artery dissection or abdominal trauma

➡ **Venous thrombosis** (5%)

- Idiopathic from hypercoagulable states
- Secondary causes from malignancy or prior abdominal surgery
- Obstruction of intestinal venous outflow leading to increased resistance of mesenteric venous blood flow resulting in bowel wall edema
  ➡**Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia**
- Splanchnic hypoperfusion and vasoconstriction
  - Low-flow state most commonly due to vasoconstriction from low cardiac output (CO) or use of vasopressors
  - Patient is typically with severe CVS disease on multiple drugs known to decrease intestinal perfusion for inotropic support (e.g. digoxin/ diuretics)
- Commonly involve areas of colon with limited collateralization such as splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction

716

2. Risk factors
   ➡Cardiac disease

- Cardiac embolism can be related to arrhythmia, valvular disease or ventricular aneurysm
- Cardiac dysfunction can lead to peripheral hypoperfusion
- Treatment of certain cardiac conditions involve use of medications that cause vasoconstriction leading to non-occlusive ischemia
  ➡Aortic surgery or instrumentation
- Atheroembolism can complicate cardiac catheterization, aortography or endovascular aortic intervention
- Aortic manipulation during aortic surgery can dislodge intraluminal thrombus or atherosclerotic debris which can embolize distally into intestinal circulation
  ➡Peripheral artery disease (PAD)
- Atherosclerotic occlusive disease of celiac artery, superior mesenteric or inferior mesenteric artery are at risk of intestinal ischemia
  ➡Hernia/ Volvulus/ Overdistension of bowel
- Incarceration and strangulation of intestinal content within hernia
- Both arterial and venous occlusion can lead to intestinal ischemia from twisting of the bowel (volvulus) around a fixed attachment (adhesion or mesenteric defect)
- Excessive bowel distension from bowel obstruction can get hypoperfusion from increased venous pressure or venous thrombosis of the involved segment of intestine
  ➡Hereditary and acquired thrombotic conditions
- Predisposes to mesenteric venous thrombosis
  ➡Infection or inflammation
- Infection or inflammation of intestines can lead to mesenteric venous thrombosis
- Arterial infection can lead to formation of aneurysm which leads to thrombosis
  ➡ Hypovolemia
- Reduces circulating blood volume leading to vasoconstriction and shunting of blood flow away from the intestines
  ➡Vasoconstrictive medication
- Predisposes to development of non-occlusive intestinal ischemia
  ➡Hemodialysis
- Low flow to intestinal circulation can lead to non-occlusive intestinal ischemia or intestinal infarction

IV. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Abdominal pain

- **MOST** common presenting symptom in intestinal ischemia
- **Classical description** = **Abdominal pain out of proportion to physical examination**
- Embolic mesenteric arterial occlusion
  - Abdominal pain is sudden, severe, periumbilical with nausea and vomiting
- Thrombotic mesenteric arterial occlusion
  - Worsened postprandial pain due to inability to increase blood flow to meet the demand of intestine postprandially
- Mesenteric venous thrombosis
  - Insidious onset of abdominal pain that wax and wane for a period before the diagnosis is established
- Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) - Severity and location of pain is variable
  ➡PR bleeding or bloody diarrhea - Typically develop within 24 hours of onset of abdominal pain
  ➡Nausea and vomiting

| Abdominal pain        | ➡ Severe abdominal pain <br> ➡ Tenderness is not prominent in early stage | ➡ Mild abdominal pain <br> ➡ Presence of tenderness |
| Bleeding              |                         ➡ Uncommon in early stage                         |  ➡ Common with rectal bleeding or bloody diarrhea   |
| Investigations        |                    ➡ MRA <br> ➡ MDCT angiography (CTA)                    |                    ➡ Colonoscopy                    |

V. **Diagnosis**

1. History taking
   ➡ Medical history

- History of embolic events (e.g. stroke)
  - Predisposes to acute embolic mesenteric ischemia
- History of DVT or PE - Predisposes to acute mesenteric venous thrombosis
  [Image of a small number 718 at the bottom right of the page]

2. Physical examination
   ➡ Vital signs

- Hypotension indicating septic shock
  ➡Abdominal examination
- Initial disease course
  - Normal (Abdominal pain out of proportion to physical examination)
  - Absence of peritoneal signs
  - Mild abdominal distension
- Advanced disease course (development of transmural bowel infarction)
  - Presence of peritoneal signs
  - Marked abdominal distension

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials - ↑ Hematocrit - Consistent with hemoconcentration - Leukocytosis - Predominance of immature of WBC
   ➡Arterial blood gas (ABG) - Metabolic acidosis
   ➡Serum LDH level - ↑ Lactate level in acute mesenteric ischemia
   ➡Serum amylase level - ↑ Amylase level in approximately half of patients with intestinal ischemia
   ➡D-dimer level - Normal D-dimer level may help to exclude acute intestinal ischemia
4. Radiological tests
   ⇨ AXR

- Relatively non-specific and can be completely normal
- Findings suggestive of mesenteric ischemia - Distended loops of bowel indicating paralytic ileus - Bowel wall thickening
  ➡CT angiography (CTA) abdomen
- Rules out other causes of acute abdomen
- Mesenteric arterial occlusions can be identified as a lack of enhancement of arterial vasculature with timed IV contrast injection
  - Thromboembolic occlusion is specific for diagnosis but absence of filling defect is not sufficiently sensitive to rule out acute mesenteric ischemia
- Mesenteric venous thrombosis can be diagnosed by perform a delayed imaging to allow for contrast filling of the mesenteric venosus system
  - Diagnosis is made by presence of venous filling defects or absence of flow
- Demonstrate finding of acute ischemia such as bowel dilation, focal or segmental bowel wall thickening, mesenteric stranding, portomesenteric thrombosis, intestinal pneumatosis with portomesenteric venous gas or solid organ infarction - Bowel wall changes are of acute mesenteric ischemia is sensitive but not specific
  ➡MR angiography (MRA) abdomen
- More sensitive for diagnosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis
- Necessary for those with an allergy to iodinated contrast

VI. **Treatment**

1. General management
   - Gastrointestinal decompression
   - Fluid resuscitation
   - Hemodynamic monitoring and support
   - Correction of electrolyte abnormality
   - Pain control
     - Parenteral opioids

2. Medical treatment
   - Anticoagulants
     - Indicated in patients with acute intestinal ischemia due to mesenteric arterial or venous occlusion or non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia
     - Prevent thrombus formation and propagation unless the patient is in active bleeding as in ischemic colitis
   - Antibiotics
     - Broad spectrum antibiotic is recommended for patients with acute mesenteric as in colonic ischemia related to non-occlusive ischemia

3. Surgical treatment - Embolic mesenteric arterial occlusion - Early surgical laparotomy with embolectomy - Rapid treatment and allows direct inspection of bowel - Thrombolysis - Local infusion of thrombolytic agent - Thrombolysis risks possible catheter-related embolism to more distal arterial mesenteric branches - Thrombotic mesenteric arterial occlusion - Surgical revascularization - Thrombolysis with endovascular angioplasty and stenting

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Volvulus (Sigmoid/ Cecal)

I. Overview

1. General features
   - Volvulus refers torsion of a segment of alimentary tract which often leads to bowel obstruction

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   - Sigmoid volvulus
     - More common in older adult **males** with mean age = 70 years old
   - Cecal volvulus
     - More common in younger **females** with mean age = 33 – 53 years old

III. Etiology

1. Risk factors
   - Sigmoid volvulus
     - Congenital
       - Long redundant sigmoid colon with narrow mesenteric attachment
     - Hirschsprung disease
       - Sigmoid volvulus can be the first presentation in Hirschsprung disease
       - Aganglionic segment below sigmoid colon and a freely mobile mesosigmoid may predispose to the development of a volvulus
     - Constipation
       - Chronic fecal overloading from constipation may cause elongation and dilatation of sigmoid colon which predispose to volvulus
   - Cecal volvulus
     - Congenital
       - Result from failed fusion of ascending colon mesentery to posterior parietal peritoneum
     - Acquired anatomical abnormalities
       - Hirschsprung disease
       - Adhesions from abdominal surgery

2. Differential diagnosis
   - Sigmoid volvulus
     - Toxin megacolon
       - Characterized by total or segmental colonic dilatation with systemic toxicity
       - Occurs as a complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), infectious colitis, ischemic colitis, volvulus, diverticulitis and obstructive CA colon
       - Bloody diarrhea is the most common clinical presentation
       - Commonly associated with Clostridium difficile and patients usually has a history of antibiotic use
     - Ogilvie's syndrome (Intestinal pseudo-obstruction)
       - Characterized by acute dilatation of colon in the absence of an anatomic lesion that obstruct the flow of intestinal content
       - Occurs in hospitalized patients in association with a severe illness or after surgery and in conjunction with a metabolic imbalance or administration of medications
       - Abdominal distension is the most common clinical presentation

721

IV. **Pathogenesis**

1. Pathogenesis of volvulus
   ➡ Occurs when air-filled loop of sigmoid colon twists about its mesentery
   ➡ Intestinal obstruction and impairment of vascular perfusion occurs when degree of torsion
   exceeds 180° and 360°

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Abdominal pain - Continuous and severe - Superimposed colicky component during peristalsis
   ➡ Abdominal distension
   ➡ Vomiting
   ➡ Absolute constipation (obstipation)

VI. **Diagnosis**

1. Physical examination
   ➡ General examination - Features indicative of perforation and peritonitis - Fever - Tachycardia - Hypotension
   ➡ Abdominal examination - Abdominal tenderness - Abdominal distension - Peritoneal signs indicative of perforation and peritonitis - Guarding - Rigidity - Rebound tenderness

[Image Description: The number 722 is located in the lower right corner of the image.]

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials
   _ Leukocytosis in bowel ischemia, necrosis or perforation
   _ and concomitantly urinary K+ secretion
   ➡ LFT
   _ Rule out other causes of abdominal pain
   ⇨ RFT
   _ Hyponatremia due to vomiting
   _ Loss of Na+ and water from gastric secretions in severe vomiting
   _ Hypokalemia due to vomiting
   _ Metabolic alkalosis increases plasma HCO3- concentration which rises above the resorptive threshold and the increased NaHCO3 are delivered to distal K+ secretory site which increases urinary K+ secretion (urinary potassium wasting)
   _ Metabolic alkalosis also shifts K+ into cells in exchange for H+ into bloodstream
   _ Hypovolemia-associated activation of RAAS leads to Na+ and water reabsorption
   Serum amylase level
   _ Rule out acute pancreatitis as the cause of abdominal pain
   ➡ Serum lactate level
   _ Sensitive markers for bowel ischemia
   ➡ Arterial blood gas (ABG)
   _ Metabolic acidosis
   _ Lactic acidosis from bowel ischemia
   _ Hypovolemia causing hypoperfusion of other organs
   _ Metabolic alkalosis
   _ Vomiting of gastric acid leading to loss of H+ ions

3. Radiological tests

[Illustration of Sigmoid volvulus:
This is a anatomical illustration depicting the human colon and rectum, highlighting a specific area called the "Sigmoid Volvulus". The colon, a long, winding tube, is shown in detail, with clear labels pointing out key sections and the affected area. The illustration is in black and white.

X-ray of Sigmoid volvulus:
This is an X-ray image showing an abnormal twisting of the sigmoid colon, known as "Sigmoid Volvulus". The image reveals a large, dilated loop of the colon, which appears as a dark, air-filled space in the lower abdomen. The surrounding anatomical structures, such as the pelvic bones and other parts of the intestine, are also visible in the X-ray.

X-ray of abdomen:
This is an X-ray image of the abdomen. The skeletal structure of the pelvis and spine is visible. The soft tissues and organs within the abdominal cavity are shown as varying shades of gray, with denser structures appearing lighter and air-filled spaces appearing darker.
]

[X-ray of Cecal volvulus:
This is an X-ray image showing an abnormal twisting of the cecum (a part of the large intestine), known as "Cecal Volvulus". The image shows a large dilated loop of the cecum with the cecum outlined in red.

- Rarely used given the risk of perforation in volvulus even though it can occasionally reduce a volvulus
- "Bird-beak" appearance where contrast tapers to the point of obstruction
  [Image of the number 725 at the bottom right of the page.]

VII. Treatment

1. Sigmoid volvulus
   ➡ Non-operative approach

- Endoscopic reduction with flexible sigmoidoscopy + Rectal tube placement
  Ο Gentle pressure with minimal insufflation permits advancement of the
  sigmoidoscope which straightens and detorse the sigmoid colon
  Ο Visualization of a dilated proximal segment filled with gas and stool or a sudden
  expulsion of gas and stool indicates successful reduction
  Ο Allows an assessment of the viability of the colon and the mucosa proximal to the
  site of obstruction should be inspected for evidence of bowel ischemia
  Ο Procedure should be immediately stopped if the mucosa appears gangrenous to
  prevent bowel perforation
  Ο Rectal tube should be placed with its proximal end beyond the area of torsion so
  as to lessen colonic distension and reduce chance of recurrent volvulus
  ➡ Operative approach
- Indicated in patients whom sigmoidoscopic reduction is unsuccessful or in patients with
  signs and symptoms suggestive of peritonitis
- Sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis
  Ο Performed if the divided bowel ends are viable, no evidence of peritoneal
  contamination and patient is hemodynamically stable
- Sigmoid colectomy with Hartman's procedure
- Sigmoid colectomy with formation of double-barrel colostomy (Paul-Mikulicz procedure)
- Sigmoidopexy
  Ο Fixation of sigmoid colon to posterior wall
  Ο Rarely performed due to high risk of recurrence

2. Cecal volvulus
   ➡ X Non-operative approach

- Endoscopic reduction with colonoscopy is **RARELY** successfully and therefore should
  **NOT** be attempted
  ➡ Operative approach

| Bowel compromise | Hemodynamic stability | Treatment approach                                                                                                                                                                               |

| No               | Stable                | ➡ Surgically detorsion + Right hemicolectomy with primary ileocolic anastomosis- Resection is required since detorsion alone is associated with high failure rate                                |
| No               | Unstable              | ➡ Cecopexy + Cecostomy tube placement- **ONLY** for patients who cannot tolerate a resectional procedure                                                                                         |
| Yes              | Stable                | ➡ Right hemicolectomy with primary ileocolic anastomosis + defunctioning loop ileostomy- Detorsion is **NOT** performed since reperfusion of compromised bowel may promote bacteremia and sepsis |
| Yes              | Unstable              | ➡ Right hemicolectomy with end ileostomy- Ileostomy is reversed once the patient is stabilized                                                                                                   |

# Gastrointestinal Disease

## Acute appendicitis

I. Overview

1. General features
   - ➡ Disease severity score
     - Grade 1: Inflamed
     - Grade 2: Gangrenous
     - Grade 3: Perforated with localized free fluid
     - Grade 4: Perforated with regional abscess
     - Grade 5: Perforated with diffuse peritonitis

2. Anatomy

[A detailed anatomical drawing illustrates the different positions of the appendix relative to the cecum, with percentages indicating their frequency. The cecum is represented as a pouch-like structure, and the appendix is shown extending from it. Labeled percentages are placed near the appendix to show the different positions, including:

- Retrocecal 74%
- Paracaecal 2%
- Subcaecal 1.5%
- Pelvic 21%
- Postileal 0.5%
- Preileal 1%
  This diagram displays the variations in appendix location and their relative prevalence.]

- ➡ General features
  - Appendix is a true diverticulum of the cecum
  - Contains all layers of colonic wall including mucosa, submucosa, longitudinal and circular muscularis and serosa
- ➡ Position of appendix
  - Appendix is located at base of cecum near ileocecal valve where the taenia coli converge on the cecum
  - Continuous growth of cecum rotates appendix into a retrocecal (74%) but intraperitoneal position during childhood
- ➡ Neurovascular anatomy
  - Appendix is supplied by appendiceal artery which is a terminal branch of ileocolic artery
  - Contains lymphoid cells in which lymphoid hyperplasia can cause obstruction and lead to acute appendicitis
    - Lymphoid tissue undergo atrophy with age

727

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ Increasingly common in childhood and early adult life
   ➡ Peak incidence = 20s – 30s
   ➡ M: F ratio = 1.4 : 1

III. Etiology

1. Microbiology
   ➡ Escherichia coli
   ➡ Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   ➡ Peptostreptococcus sp.
   ➡ Bacteroides sp.
2. Risk factors for perforation
   ➡ **Male** gender
   ➡ Extreme of age
   ➡ Diabetes mellitus (DM)
   ➡ Immunosuppression
   ➡ Previous abdominal surgery
   ➡ Fecolith obstruction
   - Fecolith is composed of fecal material, calcium phosphates, bacteria and epithelial debris
     ➡ Pelvic appendix
   - Absence of rotation of appendix during childhood

3. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Gastrointestinal diseases

- Acute diverticulitis
  - Right-sided diverticulitis is more common in Asian population
  - CT abdomen with contrast is the diagnostic test of choice in patients with suspected acute diverticulitis
- Meckel's diverticulitis
  - Congenital remnant of omphalomesenteric duct which is located on small intestine 2 feet from the ileocecal valve
  - Small bowel may migrate into RLQ and mimic symptoms of acute appendicitis
- Acute ileitis
  - Acute self-limited bacterial infection including Yersinia, Campylobacter, Salmonella
  - Should be considered when acute diarrhea is a prominent symptom
- Crohn's disease - Present with symptoms including fever, prolonged diarrhea with abdominal pain with or without gross bleeding, weight loss and fatigue
  ➡O&G diseases
- Tubo-ovarian abscess
  - Inflammatory mass involving ovary, fallopian tube and adjacent pelvic organs including the bladder and bowels
  - Most commonly found in reproductive age women resulting from upper genital tract infection and is usually a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease
- Ruptured ovarian cyst
  - Pain often begins during strenuous physical activity such as exercise or intercourse
- Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion
  - Refers to twisting of ovary on its ligamentous supports often resulting in impedance of its blood supply
- Pelvic inflammatory disease
  - Recent onset of pain that worsens during coitus or during or shortly after menses are particularly suggestive
  - Purulent endocervical discharge, cervical motion and adnexal tenderness in physical examination are particularly suggestive
- Acute endometritis
  - Occurs after obstetrical delivery or invasive uterine procedure
- Endometriosis
  - Presence of endometrial glands and stroma at extrauterine sites
- Ectopic pregnancy
  - Positive pregnancy test strongly suggests presence of an ectopic pregnancy if an intrauterine pregnancy cannot be visualized

729

➡Urological diseases
• Renal colic
• Pain typically waxes and wanes in severity and develops in paroxysms that are related to movement of stone in ureter and associated ureteral spasms
• Pain is thought to occur primarily urinary obstruction with distension of renal capsule
• Acute epididymitis
• Predisposing factors include sexual activity, heavy physical exertion and trauma
• Testicular torsion
Ο Urological emergency resulting from inadequate fixation of testis to tunica vaginalis
Ο Testis may twist on the spermatic cord potentially producing ischemia from reduced arterial inflow and venous outflow obstruction
• Torsion of the appendix testis or appendix epididymis
Ο Occurs between ages of 7 - 14 and rarely occurs in adults
Ο Appendix testis is a small vestigial structure on anterosuperior aspect of testis which is an embryological remnant of Mullerian duct system
• Appendix epididymis is a vestigial structure on the head of epididymis which is an embryological remnant of Wolffian duct system

IV. Pathogenesis

1. Pathogenesis of acute appendicitis
   ➡Appendiceal obstruction is proposed as the primary cause of appendicitis
   • Obstruction can be caused by fecaliths (_fecal hard masses_), calculi, lymphoid hyperplasia, infectious process, benign or malignant tumours
   Ο Lymphoid hyperplasia due to infection is the main cause in young patients
   Ο Fecaliths and malignancy such as carcinoid tumour, adenocarcinoma and mucocele is the main cause in older patients
   → Continuous mucus secretion and inflammatory exudation leads to increased intraluminal and intramural pressure
   • Result in thrombosis and occlusion of small vessels in appendiceal wall and stasis of lymphatic flow
   • Appendix becomes ischemic and necrotic as vascular and lymphatic supply is compromised
   ➡Bacterial overgrowth occurs within diseased appendix and intraluminal bacteria subsequently invade the appendiceal wall
   ➡Once significant inflammation and necrosis occurs the appendix is at risk of perforation which leads to localized abscess formation or diffuse peritonitis
   [Image Description: The number 730 is at the right bottom corner of the page.]

V. **Clinical manifestations**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Fever
   ➡Abdominal pain (Classical)

- Periumbilical colic
  - Visceral afferent nerve fibers enter spinal cord at T8 – 10 levels are stimulated as the appendix becomes engorged leading to the vague periumbilical abdominal pain
- Shifting to right iliac fossa - Well-localized pain occurs later in the course when inflammation involves the adjacent parietal peritoneum in right iliac fossa - Precise localization of the pain develop once the overlying parietal peritoneum which is somatically innervated becomes inflamed - More intense, constant and localized somatic pain begins to predominate
  ➡Anorexia (Classical)
  ➡Nausea and vomiting (Classical)
  ➡ Other non-specific symptoms - Indigestion - Flatulence - Diarrhea - Tenesmus - Malaise

VI. **Diagnosis**

1. Physical examination
   ➡McBurney's point tenderness - Described as maximal tenderness at 1.5 – 2 inches from ASIS on a straight line from ASIS to umbilicus
   ➡Rovsing's sign - Deep palpation of LLQ will cause pain in RLQ - Also known as indirect tenderness and is indicative of right-side local peritoneal irritation
   ➡ Psoas sign - Associated with a retrocecal appendix - Manifested by RLQ pain with passive right hip extension - Inflamed appendix may lie against the right psoas muscle causing the patient to shorten the muscle by drawing up the right knee - Patient will lie with a right hip flexed for pain relief - Passive extension of iliopsoas muscle with hip extension causes RLQ pain
   ➡Obturator sign - Associated with a pelvic appendix - Inflamed appendix may lie against the right obturator internus muscle - Manifest by RLQ pain with passive flexion of the hip and knee followed by internal rotation of the right hip
   ➡Special consideration according to position of appendix

- Retrocecal position (74%) - May not exhibit marked localized tenderness in right lower quadrant since the appendix does not come into contact with anterior parietal peritoneum - Rectal and pelvic examination is more likely to elicit positive signs than abdominal examination
  [Image of a page number at the bottom right corner of the page, reading "731"]

2. Diagnostic approach
   ➡Alvarado (MANTRELS) score

- Diagnosis of acute appendicitis is essentially clinical
- Operative decision should be based on clinical and laboratory-based scoring system
  (Alvarado score)
  ○ ≥7: Strongly predictive of acute appendicitis
  ○ 5-6: Equivocal score requiring abdominal USG or contrast-enhanced CT
  examination
  ○ ≤4: Appendicitis can be rule out with greater certainty and patient should be
  evaluated for other possible diagnosis

|            | (Higher number of young immature in response to infection or inflammation) |       |
|            | Total                                                                      | 10    |

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Leukocytosis with a left shift meaning an increase in total WBC, bands and neutrophils in the
  differential count
  ➡Clotting profile
  ➡Electrolyte profile
  ➡Inflammatory markers - ↑ CRP
  ➡Serum amylase level
  ⇨LFT - Mild elevations in serum bilirubin have been noted to be a marker for appendiceal
  perforation
  ⇨ RFT
  ➡Pregnancy test - Indicated in all women of childbearing age

732

4. Radiological tests

[Abdominal ultrasound examination showing features of acute appendicitis, distended oedematous appendix (open arrows), longitudinal scan (left) and transverse scan (right). A faecolith is seen (closed arrow). The ultrasound images demonstrate features suggesting acute appendicitis, including a distended appendix with a visible faecolith.]

[Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showing a faecolith (open arrow) at the base of a distended (>0.6 cm) appendix with intramural gas (white arrows). The CT scan shows a distended appendix with a faecolith at its base, along with intramural gas, further confirming acute appendicitis.]

➡Abdominal X-ray (AXR) (erect)

- Indicated to evaluate for other causes of acute abdomen
- NOT recommended in the diagnostic workup of suspected appendicitis nor do findings on plain radiograph change the level of suspicion for appendicitis
  ➡Ultrasound (USG) abdomen and pelvis
- (+ve) No ionizing radiation/ No intravenous contrast
- (-ve) Lower diagnostic accuracy/ Higher non-diagnostic rate/ Operator dependent/ Patient- specific (e.g. body habitus, discomfort, appendix location relative to overlying bowel)
- USG findings of appendicitis - Non-compressible appendix with double-wall thickness diameter > 6 mm - Focal pain over appendix with compression - Increased echogenicity of inflamed periappendiceal fat - Fluid in RLQ - Presence of appendicolith (posterior acoustic shadowing)
  ➡CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast
- (+ve) Highest diagnostic accuracy/Lowest non-diagnostic rate
- (-ve) Radiation is contraindicated in infants and pregnancy/Contrast is contraindicated in renal insufficiency or hypersensitivity
- CT findings of appendicitis - Enlarged appendiceal AP diameter > 6 mm with an occluded lumen - Appendiceal wall thickening > 2 mm - Periappendiceal fat stranding - Appendiceal wall enhancement - Presence of appendicolith
  ➡ MRI abdomen and pelvic with contrast
- (+ve) No ionizing radiation
- (-ve) Higher non-diagnostic rate

VII. Treatment

1. General approach
   ➡Appendectomy is the preferred treatment for complicated or uncomplicated acute appendicitis

|      | Surgery                                                                    | Antibiotic (Non-operative) |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Pros | ➡ Appendectomy can generally be performed with low morbidity and mortality | ➡ **Lower** pain score     |

➡ **Lower** risk of surgical complication
➡ **Faster** rate of recovery |
| Cons | ➡**Higher** pain score
➡**Higher** risk of surgical complication
➡**Slower** rate of recovery | ➡ Patients with history of surgical complications or phobia to appendectomy
➡ Risk of progression of symptoms
➡ Risk of developing complicated appendicitis
➡ Risk of recurrent appendicitis
➡ Greater risk in patients particularly elderly and immunocompromised

- Risk of unexpected lesion in appendix such as carcinoid or carcinoma increases with age |

➡ Non-operative approach

- Patients who present within 72 hours will undergo immediate appendectomy
- Patient who present with longer duration of symptoms should be treated non-operatively
  - Respond non-operatively since appendiceal process has already been "walled-off"
  - Immediate surgery in patients with long duration of symptoms and phlegmon formation is associated with increased morbidity due to dense adhesion and inflammation
  - Appendectomy in these circumstances often requires extensive dissection and lead to injury of adjacent structures and complications necessitating ileocolectomy or cecostomy
  - Treatment failure as evidenced by bowel obstruction, sepsis, persistent pain, fever or leukocytosis requires immediate appendectomy

➡ Interval appendectomy

- Patients who present with a "walled-off" appendiceal process can be spared an appendectomy at time of initial presentation but interval appendectomy is usually recommended 6-8 weeks after presentation
- Clinical rationale
  - Prevent recurrence of appendicitis
  - Exclude neoplasms such as carcinoid, adenocarcinoma, mucinous cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma especially in older adults who have higher incidence

[Image Description: This page has a table with Pros and Cons comparing surgery and antibiotics (non-operative) for appendicitis. Under "Surgery" in the Pros column, it says "Appendectomy can generally be performed with low morbidity and mortality". Under "Surgery" in the Cons column, it lists higher pain score, higher risk of surgical complication, and slower rate of recovery. Under "Antibiotic (Non-operative)" in the Pros column, it says "lower pain score", "lower risk of surgical complication", and "faster rate of recovery". Under "Antibiotic (Non-operative)" in the Cons column, it lists patients with history of surgical complications or phobia to appendectomy, risk of progression of symptoms, risk of developing complicated appendicitis, risk of recurrent appendicitis, greater risk in patients particularly elderly and immunocompromised, and risk of unexpected lesion in appendix such as carcinoid or carcinoma increases with age. Below the table are sections on Non-operative approach and Interval appendectomy with lists of considerations and rationale.]

2. Supportive treatment
   ➡Adequate hydration with IV fluid resuscitation

- Resuscitation = 10-20 mL/kg full-rate (pediatrics)
- Maintenance therapy

| Weight        | Fluid requirement (2 version) |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1st 10 kg     | 4 mL/kg/hr                    | 100 mL/kg/day |
| 2nd 10 kg     | 2 mL/kg/hr                    | 50 mL/kg/day  |
| Each extra kg | 1 mL/kg/hr                    | 20 mL/kg/day  |

➡Correction of electrolyte abnormalities
➡Close monitoring of vital signs and urine output
➡Pain control with analgesics

3. Medical treatment
   ➡IV Antibiotics

- Indications
  - Non-operative management for acute appendicitis
  - Preoperative antibiotics are required and is given within a 60-min "window" before the initial incision
  - Prophylactic antibiotics following appendicectomy are required to prevent wound infection and intraabdominal abscess in perforated appendicitis (NOT required in non-perforated appendicitis)
- Antibiotics choices - Metronidazole (AND) 3rd generation cephalosporin
  [A number 735 is at the bottom right of the page]

➡ Pre-operative preparation

- Orogastric tube to decompress the stomach
- Foley catheter or voiding prior to operation
- Perioperative antibiotics
  ➡ Methods of incision
- Gridiron incision
  - Made at right angle to a line joining ASIS to umbilicus centered along the line at McBurney's point
- Lanz incision - Made 2 cm below umbilicus centered on mid-clavicular-mid-inguinal line - Incision may extend medially when necessary with retraction or suitable division of rectus abdominis muscle
  ➡ Post-operative management
- Start on clear liquid diet and advanced to regular diet as tolerated
- Antibiotics are not required postoperatively for non-perforated appendicitis
  ➡ Post-operative complications
- Simple wound infection
- Intra-abdominal abscess
- Intestinal obstruction
  - Paralytic ileus
  - Adhesive intestinal obstruction
- Enterocutaneous fistula
  - Result from an intraperitoneal abscess that fistulize to the skin
- Pylephlebitis (Septic portal vein thrombosis) - Associated with high fever, chills and rigors and jaundice - Thrombosis and infection within portal venous system - Caused by septicemia in portal venous system and leads to development of intra-hepatic abscesses
  VIII. Prognosis

1. Complications
   ➡ Perforation of appendix

- Patients develop inflammation and necrosis of appendix
- Increase risk of perforation once significant inflammation and necrosis occurs which leads to localized abscess formation or diffuse peritonitis
- Considered in patients when fever > 39.4°C, WBC > 15 x 109/L and imaging studies reveal fluid collection in RLQ

## Peritonitis

I. **Overview**

1. General features
   - ➡Peritonitis refers to inflammation of peritoneum
   - ➡One of the commonest surgical emergency
     - Peritoneum becomes hyperemic, edematous and covered with fibrinous exudates
     - Leads to septicaemia, endotoxemia, shock, hypovolemia and multi-organ failure

2. Classification of peritonitis
   - ➡Primary peritonitis
     - Ascitic fluid infection without an evident surgically-treatable intraabdominal source
     - **Common** in patients with liver cirrhosis
   - ➡Secondary peritonitis
     - Ascitic fluid infection with a surgically treatable intrabdominal source of infection
     - Chemical irritation from gastric juice, bile, pancreatic juice, urine and blood
     - Chemical irritation is followed by bacterial infection
   - ➡Tertiary peritonitis
     - Opportunistic infection with normally non-pathogenic gut flora
     - Associated with prolonged use of antibiotics in persistent intrabdominal infection

II. **Etiology**

1. Risk factors

V. **Treatment**

1. Treatment for primary peritonitis
   ➡ Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis - 3rd generation cephalosporin should be used - Cefotaxime - Ceftriaxone - Indications for antibiotics therapy (any of the following) - Fever > 37.8°C - Abdominal pain or tenderness - Altered mental status - Ascitic fluid PMN count ≥ 250 cells/mm³
   ➡ CAPD-peritonitis - Gram +ve: Vancomycin or 1st generation cephalosporin (e.g. cefazolin) - Gram -ve: Aminoglycoside or 3rd or 4th generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftazidime/ cefepime)

2. Treatment of secondary peritonitis
   ➡ Surgical correction of underlying pathology - Laparotomy if surgically treatable source of infection is documented

[Image Description: The number 742 is in the lower right corner of the page.]

VI. Case study
Case 1
A 60-year-old woman with a long-standing history of non-insulin dependent DM developed diabetic
nephropathy. She received continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis with three 2-1 exchanges per day
performed by herself for 2 years. She also had diabetic retinopathy. She presented with acute diffuse
abdominal pain a few hours ago. There was nausea and mild diarrhea after onset of abdominal pain.
Peritoneal fluid effluent was noticed to be turbid and the effluent amount was noticed to be significantly less
than usual. There was no fever. She lived alone and cared for herself. However, because of retinopathy, she
could not read newspaper or watch television clearly. She took glibenclamide 5 mg daily for her DM.
Physical examination shows her temperature was 37°C and her BP was 165/70 mmHg. Abdominal
examination showed mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, with a Tenckhoff catheter in-situ. There was some
pus and erythema at the exit site of the catheter.
Q1: What condition is she suffering from?
➡Peritonitis under peritoneal dialysis
Q2: What are the diagnostic features of peritonitis complicating peritoneal dialysis?
⇨ Fever
➡Abdominal pain
➡Turbid peritoneal dialysis effluent with WBC > 100/mm³
Q3: Does the absence of fever exclude peritonitis as the cause of her abdominal pain?
No, infection can be localized or low grade
Q4: What are the common organisms that may cause peritonitis complicating peritoneal dialysis?
➡Gram+ve organisms

- Coagulase -ve staphylococcus
- S. aureus
  Gram-ve organisms
- E. coli
  ➡M. tuberculosis
  ➡Fungal species
  Q5: What are the possible precipitating factors for her peritonitis?
  ➡Poor eye sight or poor eye-hand coordination from DM retinopathy predisposes her to contamination
  during dialysis exchanges
  ➡Unhygienic home environment
  ➡Exit site infection noted in examination
  Tunnel infection
  Q6: When should antibiotic treatment be instilled?
  ➡As early as possible if the diagnosis of peritonitis is certain clinically
  ➡ Do not wait for laboratory confirmation or culture result since delayed treatment carries a worse
  outcome
  743

Q7: What is the antibiotic treatment of choice before culture result is available?
➡General rule

- Use less broad spectrum drugs
- Avoid vancomycin
  ➡1st generation cephalosporin + aminoglycoside (Intraperitoneal)
- Aminoglycoside can be replaced by a 3rd generation cephalosporin to preserve residual renal function and avoid ototoxicity

Q8: Should she be continued on peritoneal dialysis during infection?
➡Continuous peritoneal dialysis should be continued unless peritonitis is refractory to treatment
Q9: What shall be done if the peritonitis does not respond to your antibiotic treatment?
➡Adjust antibiotic therapy according to culture result and sensitivity
➡Patient should be put on hemodialysis and antibiotic continued
➡Tenckhoff catheter should be removed and reinserted for peritoneal dialysis few weeks later after total subsidence of peritonitis signs and symptoms

Q10: What is the chance of successful treatment of her peritonitis?
➡Success rate > 90%

- Lower success rate for Gram -ve organism
- Much lower success rate for fungal peritonitis

Q11: What is the effect of peritonitis on her BG control?
➡Infection will induce hyperglycemia
➡ Nausea and anorexia of peritonitis will lead to malnutrition and hence hypoglycemia in patients receiving hypoglycemic agents or insulin

Q12: Is oral hypoglycemic therapy a good choice for her DM control? What are the other treatment options and route of administration of insulin? What are the pros and cons?
➡Insulin is better than oral hypoglycemic agents

- Insulin has a prolonged t1/2 in end-stage renal failure with risk of hypoglycemia
- Insulin can be given subcutaneously in the usual way or intraperitoneally by injecting into the dialysate bag - Pros: Intraperitoneal insulin can be directly absorbed into the splanchnic system and continuous absorption with dialysate glucose during a peritoneal dialysis dwell - Cons: Intraperitoneal insulin requires a much higher dose since there is adsorption to plastic bag and tubes as well as incomplete absorption - Cons: Intraperitoneal insulin can also introduce organisms into dialysate
  ➡Low-dose hypoglycemic agents are also acceptable

## Hemorrhoids

I. **General features**

1. **Definition**
   ➡ **Internal** hemorrhoids
   - Above the dentate line with columnar epithelium (i.e. mucosa)
   - Receive visceral innervation which is less sensitive to pain and irritation
     - Internal hemorrhoids can therefore amendable to office-based procedures with minimal or no anesthesia
   - Characteristically lie in 3, 7, 11 o'clock positions (_Reference_: 12 o'clock is suprapubic)
     - Anatomical 3 venous columns are present in these direction
   - Further subclassified into 4 grades based on degree of prolapse from anal canal
     ➡ **External** hemorrhoids
   - Below the dentate line with squamous epithelium (i.e. skin)
   - Surrounds the anal verge and are not true hemorrhoids
   - Receive somatic innervation which is more sensitive to pain and irritation
     - Symptomatic external hemorrhoids that are refractory to conservative management are generally treated surgically under anesthesia
     - With the exception of small acutely thrombosed external hemorrhoids which can sometimes be treated in the office
   - _"5-day, painful, self-curing lesion"_

II. **Pathophysiology**

1. **Anatomy of anal canal**
   ➡ Characteristics of anal canal
   - Measuring 4 cm long from the anal verge
   - Dentate (Pectinate) line divides upper 2/3 and lower 1/3 of anal canal

| Lymphatic drainage | Abdominal lymph node (Internal iliac and inferior mesenteric LN) | Inguinal lymph node (Superficial inguinal lymph node) |

III. **Etiology**

1. **Risk factors**
   ➡ Low fibre diet
   ➡ Family history of hemorrhoids

2. **Increased intra-abdominal pressure**
   ➡ Pregnancy
   ➡ Constipation
   ➡ Chronic cough
   ➡ Obesity

| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1st    | √                    | √                    | √                       | √                    | X                |
| 2nd    | √                    | √                    | √                       | X                    | X                |
| 3rd    | √                    | √                    | X                       | X                    | √                |
| 4th    | X                    | X                    | X                       | X                    | √                |

➡ Indications for surgical treatment

- 3rd or 4th degree hemorrhoids
- 2nd degree hemorrhoids that failed non-operative treatments
- Fibrosed hemorrhoids
- Hemorrhoidal bleeding leading to anemia

2. Conservative management
   ➡ Dietary modifications

- High fibre diet
  ➡ Normalize bowel and defecatory habits
- Evacuate only when natural desires arise
- Adopt defecatory position to minimize straining
- Addition of stool softeners and bulking agents to ease defecation
  ➡ Sitz baths
- Relax the sphincter muscles and relieve spasm of anal sphincter muscles
  ○ Patients with significant hemorrhoids tend to have elevated sphincter tone
- Relieve irritation and pruritus
- Reduce inflammation and edema

➡ Analgesics cream

- Topical ointments that include analgesic such as mixed lidocaine/hydrocortisone are effective for relieving acute pain associated with hemorrhoids
- Side effects such as contact dermatitis may occur
  ➡ Hydrocortisone suppositories
- Shrink the hemorrhoids and relieve associated pruritus
- Should not be used for longer than 1 week since side effects may occur including mucosal atrophy with steroid creams
  ➡ Venoactive agents
- Phlebotonics are primarily used to treat acutely inflamed and bleeding hemorrhoids
- Heterogeneous class of plant extracts (i.e. flavonoids) which is categorized as a medical food and not as a drug
- Improves venous tone, microvascular permeability, lymphatic activity and microcirculatory nutritive flow
- Example: Daflon

[Image Description: The image shows a table summarizing different types of laxatives (osmotic, bulk, and stimulant), their examples, mechanisms of action, and side effects. Below the table, there are bullet points describing analgesics cream, hydrocortisone suppositories, and venoactive agents, including their uses and potential side effects.]

4. Office-based procedures
   ➡Rubber band ligation

- Most commonly performed since it is inexpensive, easy to perform and rarely causes serious complications
- Only for internal hemorrhoids and external hemorrhoids are **NOT** amendable to banding
- Patients with Grade I, II and III hemorrhoids are best candidates and treatment is often successful after one or two applications (proceed to surgery if ineffective)
  - Compared with sclerotherapy and or infrared coagulation, rubber band ligation is more effective and requires fewer treatment sessions
- **NOT** recommended for Grade IV hemorrhoids which surgery is the best treatment
- Contraindicated in patients with coagulopathies or patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension due to the risk of significant delayed hemorrhage
- Usually only one hemorrhoidal column should be treated at a time to minimize excessive tissue necrosis and as many as 3 bands in a single column can be safely performed
  - Several hemorrhoids can still be banded during the same session if patients tolerate the procedure with only minimal discomfort
  - If multiple sessions are needed, repeat banding should be performed in 3 - 4 weeks interval to allow any swelling and ulcerations to subside
- Complications - Pain (_most_ frequent occurring in 8%) - Delayed hemorrhage - Localized infection/Sepsis - Urinary retention - Hemorrhoidal thrombosis
  ➡Injection sclerotherapy
- Injection of sclerosants such as phenol (5%) in vegetable oil which causes an intense inflammatory reaction destroying redundant submucosal tissue associated with hemorrhoidal prolapse
- Indicated in patients with coagulopathies, on antiplatelets or anticoagulants, immunocompromised or with portal hypertension - Rubber band ligation is contraindicated due to high risk of delayed bleeding - Sclerotherapy is better studied than infrared coagulation in the literature for these groups of patients
  ➡Infrared coagulation
- Direct application of infrared light waves to hemorrhoidal tissues
- Patients with Grade I and II hemorrhoids are candidates for this procedure

749

5. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Hemorrhoidectomy
   ➡ Stapled hemorrhoidopexy - Refers to use of stapling device to remove a ring of rectal mucosa and mucosa with the creation of a mucosal anastomosis above the dentate line - Hemorrhoids are not excised but instead the hemorrhoidal tissues are pulled back into anal canal from prolapsed position and the blood supply to hemorrhoids are interrupted - **Advantages** over hemorrhoidectomy - Less pain and analgesic, quicker recovery and shorter hospital stay - Less post-operative bleeding and wound complications - Higher patient's satisfaction - **Disadvantages** over hemorrhoidectomy - Higher recurrence rate - Serious complications can occur including rectal perforation, rectovaginal fistula and pelvic sepsis
   ➡ Post-operative complications - Early post-operative complications - Pain - Retention of urine - Reactionary hemorrhage - Late post-operative complications - Incontinence - Anal stricture - Anal fissures - Secondary hemorrhage

VII. Complications

1. Complications of hemorrhoids
   ➡ Strangulation and thrombosis
   ➡ Gangrene
   ➡ Ulceration
   ➡ Fibrosis
   ➡ Portal pyemia

## Anal fissures

I. Overview

1. General features

[Photograph of the anal region. In the first part of the image there is an anus with a visible cut with a red arrow pointing to the cut. The second part of the image shows the anus with the anal fissure. There are also arrows pointing to the anus and the anal fissure.]

➡ Anal fissures refers to a tear in the anoderm distal to the dentate line
➡ One of the most common anorectal conditions resulting from high anal pressure
➡ Anal fissures usually occur in the posterior anal midline
➡ Acute anal fissures
_ Typically heals within 6 weeks with conservative local management
➡ Chronic anal fissures
_ Fails conservative management and requires a more aggressive surgical approach

II. Etiology

1. Primary causes
   ➡ Local trauma to anal canal
   _ Passage of hard stools
   _ Prolonged diarrhea
   _ Vaginal delivery
   _ Anal sex

2. Secondary causes
   ➡ Inflammatory bowel disease
   _ Crohn's disease
   _ Ulcerative colitis
   ➡ Granulomatous disease
   _ Extrapulmonary TB
   _ Sarcoidosis
   ➡ Malignancy
   _ Squamous cell anal cancer
   _ Leukemia
   ➡ Sexually-transmitted diseases
   _ HIV infection
   _ Syphilis \* Chlamydia

III. **Pathogenesis**

1. Pathogenesis of anal fissures
   ➡ Stretching of anal mucosa beyond its normal capacity - Repeated injury leads to spams of the exposed internal sphincter muscle beneath the tear - Spasm pulls the edges of fissure apart which impairs healing of wound
   ➡ Ischemia secondary to reduced perfusion - Anoderm at posterior midline has less blood flow than other quadrants in anal canal - Increased anal pressure leads to reduced rate of perfusion

IV. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Painful defecation - Tearing pain with passage of bowel movements
   ➡ Bright rectal bleeding - Limited to a small amount on toilet paper or surface of stool
   ➡ Perianal pruritus or skin irritation

2. Features of anal fissures
   ➡ _Typical_ features - Single posterior or anterior fissure without evidence of Crohn's disease
   ➡ _Atypical_ features - Multiple, recurring, non-healing, deep or wide, painless and at off-midline locations - Suggests secondary causes of anal fissures

3. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Perianal ulcers or sores
   ➡ Anorectal fistula
   ➡ Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome

V. **Diagnosis**

1. Physical examination
   ➡ Anorectal examination - Most common location of primary anal fissure is posterior anal midline - Typically identified as a laceration ranging in depth from superficial, shallow laceration to a deep wound extending into the external sphincter - Acute fissure (**Pathognomonic feature** = Superficial tear) - Superficial tear - Fresh laceration resembling a paper cut - Chronic fissure (**Pathognomonic feature** = Hypertrophied with skin tags or papillae) - Raised edges exposing white horizontally oriented fibers of the internal anal sphincter muscle fibers at the base of fissure - Hypertrophied anal papillae at the proximal end of fissure - Skin tags (sentinel pile) at the distal end of fissure

➡ Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy - Evaluation of underlying Crohn's disease in patients with atypical features of fissures - Evaluation of colorectal cancer in which patients can present with similar symptoms

VI. Treatment

1. Medical treatment
   ➡Supportive treatment

- Increased dietary fibers and water intake
- Stool softener or laxatives
- Warm sitz bath
  - Relax anal sphincter and improve blood flow to anal mucosa
- Topical analgesics - Lidocaine jelly
  ➡Topical vasodilators
- Topical nifedipine ointment
- Topical nitroglycerin ointment

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡Botulinum toxin type A injection

- Indicated in patients who fail 8 weeks of initial medical treatment
  ➡Lateral internal sphincterotomy
- Indicated in patients who fail 8 weeks of initial medical treatment

VII. Prevention

1. Prevention of anal fissures
   ➡High fibre diet and adequate fluids
   ➡Avoid trauma to anus
   ➡Avoid straining during defecation
   ➡Prompt treatment of diarrhea
   ➡Prevented by using proper anal hygiene

- Keep the anal area dry
- Wiping with a soft cotton or moisten cloth

## Anorectal abscess

I. **Overview**

1. General features

[Image Description: A diagram illustrates a cross-section of the anorectal region, showcasing various types of abscesses. The rectum is centrally positioned and labeled. Four abscess types are highlighted with colored boxes: a light blue box indicates a "Supralevator abscess" located near the top of the rectum. A green area represents an "Ischiorectal abscess" on the lower left side of the rectum. A yellow area points to an "Intersphincteric abscess" near the base of the rectum. And a small red area points to a "Perianal abscess" at the base of the rectum.]

➡ Acute phase manifestation of a collection of purulent material that arises from glandular crypts in anus or rectum

- Anorectal fistula is the chronic phase of suppuration in this perirectal process

➡ Traverse distally in intersphincteric groove into perianal skin
➡ Can expand into adjacent tissues including ischiorectal and supralevator space or even progress into generalized systemic infection

2. Different sites of anorectal abscess

   ➡ Perianal region (20%)

   ➡ Intersphincteric region (18%)

   ➡ Ischiorectal region (60%)

   ➡ Supralevator region (2%)

II. **Etiology**

1.  Causes of anorectal abscess

    ➡ Cryptoglandular infection\*
    - Infection of the anal glands

    ➡ Other infections

        *   Inflammatory bowel disease
        *   Tuberculosis
        *   Actinomycosis
        *   Foreign body

754

### III. Pathogenesis

1. Pathogenesis of an anal abscess
   ➡ Originates from an infected anal crypt gland which penetrate the internal sphincter and end in the intersphincteric plane
   ➡ Obstruction of anal crypt gland with inspissated debris permits bacterial growth and abscess formation

### IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Pain in anal or rectal area

- Constant pain
- Not necessarily associated with a bowel movement
- Associated with symptoms including fever and malaise
  ➡ Purulent discharge
  ➡ Constipation
  ➡ Urinary difficulties

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Anorectal fistula
   ➡ Internal hemorrhoid
   ➡ Presacral epidermoid cyst

### V. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡ Anorectal examination

- Area of fluctuance or erythematous indurated skin overlying perianal skin
  ➡ Digital rectal examination
- Abscess can be felt in DRE if there is no findings on physical inspection

2. Radiological tests
   ➡ CT/ MRI scan

- Indicated in a non-palpable abscess

### VI. Treatment

1. General approach
   ➡ Incision and drainage
   ➡ Antibiotics has **MINIMAL** role

- Except in patients with cellulitis, valvular heart disease, prosthetic heart valves and immunosuppression

[Image Description: The image is a simple black and white text document with a few bullet points. The text covers pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, diagnosis and treatment of anal abcess.

## Anorectal fistulas (Fistula-in-ano (FIA))

I. Overview

1. General features

[Diagram of an anorectal fistula. The diagram shows the rectum and anus, and the different types of fistulas that can occur. The fistulas are classified by their location relative to the anal sphincter muscles.
Levator ani muscle, Puborectalis muscle, Internal anal sphincter, External anal sphincter, Superficial fistula are labelled]

Extrasphincteric fistula (Parks Type IV), Transsphincteric fistula (Parks Type II), Intersphincteric fistula (Parks Type I), Suprapshincteric fistula (Parks Type III)

- Fistula is a communication between 2 epithelial surfaces
- Anorectal fistula is the chronic manifestation of the acute perirectal process that forms an anal abscess
  - When the abscess ruptures or is drained an epithelialized track can form that connects the abscess in the anus or rectum with the perirectal skin

3. Classification of anorectal fistula
   ➡Simple fistula

- Minimal involvement of external sphincter
- Park's classification Type 1 (intersphincteric)
- Park's classification Type 2 (transsphincteric) involving < 30% of anal sphincter complex
  ➡Complex fistula
- Any fistula involving more than 30% of external sphincter
- Park's classification Type 3 (suprasphincteric)
- Park's classification Type 4 (extrasphincteric)
- Fistula with multiple tracts
- Recurrent fistula
- Fistula related to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
- Fistula related to infectious diseases including TB and HIV
- Fistula secondary to local radiation treatments
- Patients with a history of anal incontinence

II. Etiology

1. Causes of anorectal fistula
   ➡Anorectal abscesses (**most common >90%**)

- Often evolves from a spontaneously draining anorectal abscess originating from the crypts of Morgagni (cryptoglandular infection) which are located between two layers of anal sphincter - As such most internal openings of fistula are located around anal glands surrounding the dentate lines
  ➡Crohn's disease
- Fistulas complicating Crohn's disease may be accompanied by associated bowel symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea
  ➡Lymphogranuloma venereum
- Chronic infection in lymphatic system by Chlamydia trachomatis
- Can cause inflammatory perirectal masses
  ➡Radiation proctitis
- Patients undergoing pelvic radiation can develop bleeding, rectal pain and fistulas
  ➡Rectal foreign bodies
- Anorectal mucosal laceration leading to formation of abscess and fistula
  ➡Actinomycosis
- Primary perianal actinomycosis is a rare condition causing simple anal fistula or inflamed perianal mass in immunocompromised individuals

III. **Pathogenesis**

1. Pathophysiology
   ➡ Majority of anorectal fistula originate from an infected anal crypt gland

- Glands penetrate the internal sphincter and end in intersphincteric plane
  ➡ Anorectal fistula is the connection between two epithelial structures
- Connects the anal abscess from the infected anal crypt glands to the perirectal skin

IV. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Painful defecation

- Intermittent rectal pain particularly during defecation but also with sitting and activity
  ➡ Purulent drainage
- Intermittent and malodorous perianal drainage
  ➡ Perianal pruritus

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Anal abscess
   ➡ Anal fissure
   ➡ Anal ulcers or sores

V. **Diagnosis**

1. Physical examination
   ➡ Internal and external opening of fistula tract need to be identified
   ➡ Anorectal examination

- External opening of anal fistula can be seen on external examination
  - Typically appears as a small dimpled area of granulation tissue that drains pus or blood on manual compression
- Pustule-like lesion in perianal or buttock area
- Perianal skin is excoriated and inflamed
  ➡ Anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy
- Internal opening in anus can be viewed with anoscopy
- Internal opening is rectum can be viewed with sigmoidoscopy

2. Radiological tests
   ➡ Examination under anesthesia (EUA)

- Fistula can be explored with a fistula probe
- Probe is inserted into the external opening on perianal skin and passed through the internal opening in anus or rectum
- Determine whether the fistula is simple or complex based on the extent of anal sphincter muscle involvement and other characteristic of fistula
- Performed with caution to avoid creating a false passage by penetrating the fistula wall
  ➡ Imaging modalities to show air or contrast material within fistula
- Endosonography (EUS)
- CT/ MRI anal canal
- Fistulography

VI. **Treatment**

1. General approach
   ➡Goal of surgery is to eradicate fistula while preserving fecal continence
   ➡ Probing of the fistula is required before surgery to determine its anatomy
   ➡ Lifestyle modification - Avoid constipation - Maintain proper anal hygiene
   ➡ Choices of surgical technique - Simple fistula = Fistulotomy - Complex fistula = Sphincter-sparing procedures - Complex fistula refers to those with a high risk of treatment failure and cannot be
   safely treated by routine fistulotomy - Primary fistulotomy is inadequate due to high risk of post-operative incontinence
   and therefore sphincter-sparing procedures are necessary - Park's classification Type 3 (suprasphincteric) - Should be treated with endoanal advancement flaps - NOT treated by LIFT since there is no intersphincteric fistula tract - Park's classification Type 4 (extrasphincteric) - Typically not of cryptoglandular in origin but are instead caused by
   Crohn's disease or IBD - Surgical options include fecal diversion or proctectomy
2. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Fistulotomy - Involves laying open the fistula tract in its entirety - Effective treatment for simple fistula that results in healing in > 90% of patients - Contraindicated in patients with preexisting incontinence - Probe is inserted into the internal opening and gently passed along fistula tract to the
   external opening - Most critical step is to identify and curette the internal opening to reduce the risk
   of recurrence - Incision is made over the entire length of fistula using the probe as a guide - Tract is gently curetted and an absorbable stitch is used to marsupialize the tract to
   promote healing and the wound is packed with gauze and covered with dressing - Marsupialization of tract is preferred as it may speed up wound healing
   ➡ Setons - Cutting (snug) seton = Reactive suture placed through the fistula tract and tightened at
   regular intervals which slowly cuts through the tract and causes scarring while preventing
   the wide disruption of anal sphincter associated with fistulotomy - Draining seton = Seton placed primarily for drainage and help eradicate the septic focus
   while preserving the sphincter mechanism

➡ Sphincter-sparing procedures (all procedures below involve dilation of anal canal, anoscopy and
identification of internal opening)

- Endoanal/ Endorectal advanced flaps
  - Closing off the internal opening of fistula by a mobilized flap of healthy tissue consisting of mucosa and submucosa
  - Flap provides tissue coverage of tract internal opening and allows tract to heal and close
- Ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT)
  - Secure closure of internal opening and removal of infected cryptoglandular tissues
- Fistula plugs
  - Does not generate a foreign body reaction nor necessitate disruption of anal sphincter and thus eliminates the risk of sphincter dysfunction associated with fistulotomy and setons
  - Designed to ameliorate postoperative incontinence in high-risk fistula patients

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

# Rectal prolapse (Rectal procidentia)

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Rectal prolapse is a pelvic floor disorder

- Pelvic floor muscles include levator ani (**puborectalis** + **pubococcygeus** + **iliococcygeus** muscles) supports the pelvic organs such as rectum, bladder and uterus
- Pelvic floor separates true pelvis from the perineum
  ➡Extent of rectal prolapse
- Complete rectal prolapse refers to protrusion of all layers of rectum through the anus
  - Circumferential full thickness rectal wall prolapse beyond anal canal
- Partial rectal prolapse refers to protrusion of the mucosa only

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ Majority affects elder women

III. Etiology

1. Risk factors
   ➡Demographics

- Female age > 40
  ➡Medical history
- Chronic straining
- Chronic constipation
- Chronic diarrhea
- Pelvic floor dysfunction
  - Paradoxical puborectalis contraction
  - Non-relaxing puborectualis muscle
  - Abnormal perineal descent
- Pelvic floor anatomic defects
  - Rectocele

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Prolapsed internal hemorrhoids
   ➡ Rectal mucosal prolapse

- Occult rectal prolapse involving intussusception
- Telescoping of bowel on itself internally without protruding through anal verge and thus not a true rectal prolapse
  ➡ Solitary rectal ulcer

V. **Diagnosis**

1. Physical examination
   ➡ Anorectal examination

- Full thickness protrusion of rectum - Concentric rings of rectum protruding through anus
  ➡ Digital rectal examination
- Anal sphincter weakness
- Attenuated sphincter tone
- Anorectal mass
- Concomitant pelvic floor pathology
  - Cystocele/ Rectocele/ Uterine prolapse

[Image Description: The page number 762 is located at the bottom right of the page.]

2. Radiological tests
   ➡ Dynamic pelvic MRI

- Indicated in patients for whom prolapse cannot be reproduced on physical examination or when symptoms are suggestive of additional pelvic floor disorder
  ➡ Defecography
- Assessed by either traditional fluoroscopy or dynamic MRI
- Reveals defects associated with rectal prolapse
  ➡ Pelvic physiology studies
- Evaluation of fecal incontinence secondary to obstetrical injuries - Manometry - Electromyography (EMG) - Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML)
  ➡ Colonoscopy
- Detects other pathology such as malignancy
  ➡ Colonic transit study
- Performed for operative candidates that have a severe or lifelong history of constipation to determine if sigmoid colectomy is indicated to treat rectal prolapse

VI. Treatment

1. Surgical treatment
   ➡ General features

- Abdominal or perineal approach are both available
- Indicated in patients with sensation of mass from prolapsed bowel, fecal incontinence or constipation associated with rectal prolapse
  ➡ Rectopexy
- Affix pararectal tissues to the presacral fascia or sacral periosteum in the sacral promontory using non-absorbable sutures or mesh
  ➡ Sigmoid resection
- Resection of sigmoid colon in patients if it is redundant
- Use as an adjunct to rectopexy to improve postoperative bowel function in patients with constipation

# Common signs and symptoms

# Hematuria

I. Overview

1. Definition of hematuria
   ➡ Gross hematuria

- Refers to hematuria visible to the naked eye
- Suspected in the presence of red or brown urine
  - Red or brown urine does not necessary means hematuria
  - Red urine sediment after centrifugation confirms hematuria
  - Red urine supernatant after centrifugation should be tested by dipstick heme
  - +ve Dipstick heme suggests hemoglobinuria or myoglobinuria
  - -ve Dipstick heme suggests drug-induced such as rifampin, pyridium, phenytoin or acute intermittent porphyria
- Gross hematuria with passage of clot ALWAYS indicates NON-glomerular bleeding
  - Blood clots indicates heavy focal bleeding in which whole blood is shed into urine in amounts sufficient to support clot formation
  - Characteristic absence of blood clots due to glomerular bleeding is because glomerular bleeding is typically a diffuse capillary process in which minute amounts of blood are added to relative large volume of glomerular filtrate + presence of urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator in glomeruli and tubules makes clot formation unlikely
- Gross hematuria in adult should be regarded as a symptom of malignancy until proven otherwise and demand immediate urological examination
  - Most common cause of gross hematuria in patient ≥ 50 is CA bladder

➡ Microscopic hematuria

- Refers to hematuria detectable only on examination of the urine sediment by microscopy
- Defined as presence of≥ 3 RBC per high-power field in a spun urine sediment
- Dipstick heme can detect 1 - 2 RBC per high-power field and thus is as sensitive as urine sediment examination but may has FP results
  - FP results arise when there is myoglobinuria, post-menstruation or ejaculation
  - +ve Dipstick heme should always be confirmed with microscopic examination

### III. Diagnosis

1. History taking

- History of presenting illness (HPI)
  - Timing of hematuria
    - Whole stream = Kidney/ Ureter/ Bladder
    - Initial stream = Urethra (Membranous and spongy urethra)
    - Terminal stream = Bladder neck/ Prostate (Prostatic urethra)
  - Painless hematuria
    - Suggests tumour or renal parenchymal disease
  - Fever and dysuria
    - Suggests urinary tract infection (UTI)
  - Unilateral flank pain radiating to groin
    - Suggests ureteric obstruction due to calculi or blood clot, malignancy or IgA nephropathy
  - Hesitance, dribbling, weak and intermittent stream
    - Suggests BPH or CA prostate (cellular proliferation with increased vascularity and the new vessels are fragile)
  - Hematospermia
    - CA prostate
- Medical history
  - Tuberculosis (TB)
  - Recent upper respiratory tract infection
    - Suggests post-infectious glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy or hereditary nephropathy
  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
  - Hypertension
- Drug history
  - Anticoagulants
  - Cyclophosphamide/ Ifosfamide
    - Suggests hemorrhagic cystitis
  - Radiotherapy
    - Suggests irradiation cystitis
    - Previous irradiation for CA rectum and cervix
- Family history
  - Polycystic kidney disease
  - Hereditary nephritis
- Menstrual history
  - Contamination with menstrual blood should be ruled out by repeating urinalysis after the menstruation has ceased
  - Cyclic hematuria during and shortly after menstruation suggest endometriosis of the urinary tract
- Social history
  - Smoking
  - Vigorous exercise
    - Exercise-induced hematuria

766

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials
   ➡ Clotting profile
   ➡Urine smear and culture

- Mid-stream urine (MSU) for smear and culture with sensitivity testing
- Early morning urine (EMU) for TB as it is in large amount and high concentration
- Evaluation of urinary tract infection (UTI)
- All patients should have culture to exclude infection prior to evaluation of hematuria
  ➡Urine cytology
- Requires whole urine sample to increase yield for malignant cells
- ONLY useful for patients with suspected carcinoma in situ and is able to detect high grade transitional cancer before gross lesion is noticeable
- Patients with risk for malignancy and irritative voiding symptoms
- NOT recommended due to variable sensitivity and specificity to evaluate patients with gross or microscopic hematuria
- Interpretation = Normal/ Atypical/ **Suspicious**/ **Malignant**
  ➡ Urinalysis

[Image of a page number 767]

➡ Renal biopsy

- Indicated in patients with glomerular hematuria or with risk factors for progressive diseases such as proteinuria or elevation in serum creatinine concentration
- Most common biopsy finding is IgA nephropathy, hereditary nephritis, non-specific glomerulonephritis and basement membrane diseases (e.g. benign familial hematuria)
- Contraindications to percutaneous renal biopsy
  - Bleeding diathesis
  - Severe hypertension
  - Solitary kidney
  - Small kidneys indicative of chronic irreversible disease
  - Hydronephrosis
  - Renal or perirenal infection

3. Radiological tests
   ➡ Cystoscopy

- Standard imaging modality for patients with hematuria
- Only modality that permits visualization of urethra, prostate and the entire bladder for malignancy and identify source of bleeding
- Permits biopsy for histological diagnosis

➡ CT urography (CTU)\*

- Preferred initial and standard imaging modality in unexplained hematuria
- Accurately visualize the ureteral and pelvicalyceal surfaces and provides global imaging
- Higher sensitivity and specificity than other imaging modalities in detection of renal mass, urinary tract calculi, pelvicalyceal and ureteric transitional cell carcinoma

➡ Ultrasound (USG) kidney or bladder\*

- Indicated in pregnant women in which CTU cannot be performed
- Less sensitive but can improve characterization of renal mass when combined with CTU
- Useful for detection of renal and bladder lesion, hydronephrosis and prostate size measurement

➡ Magnetic resonance urography (MRU)\*

- Less able to detect smaller urothelial lesions and non-obstructing stones
- Acceptable imaging alternative in patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast administration

➡ Retrograde pyelogram

- Invasive investigation used for diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction via cystocopy
- Useful to localize obstruction when there is insufficient renal function to excrete intravenous contrast

⇨ KUB

- NOT commonly performed in patients of suspected renal disease
- May be useful in patients presenting with symptoms of nephrolithiasis to identify stones

➡ Intravenous urogram (IVU)\*

- Largely replaced by CTU
- Insensitive for detection of small renal and bladder lesion

Remarks: Upper urinary tract imaging = \*

768

IV. Case study

Q: What are the risk factor for malignancy in asymptomatic microscopic hematuria?

➡Age >35 years
➡Smoking history in which the risk correlates with the extent of exposure
➡Occupational exposure to chemicals or dyes (benzenes or aromatic amines), such as printers, painters, and chemical plant workers
➡History of gross hematuria
➡History of chronic cystitis or irritative voiding symptoms
➡History of pelvic irradiation
➡History of exposure to cyclophosphamide
➡History of a chronic indwelling foreign body
➡History of exposure to aristolochic acid
➡History of analgesic abuse, which is also associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the kidney

I. Overview

1. General features
   - Inability to voluntarily passing urine relieved with drainage
   - Most common urological emergency

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   - Occurs most frequently in men over age 60
     - 10% in men age > 70
     - 30% in men age > 80
   - More common in males due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
   - Rare in females

III. Etiology

1. Outflow obstruction
   - Males
     - Constipation
     - Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
     - Prostatitis
     - CA Prostate
     - CA Bladder
     - Urethritis (with urethral edema)
     - Urethral strictures
     - Urethral stones
     - Phimosis or paraphimosis
   - Females
     - Constipation
     - Cystocele or rectocele
     - Gynaecological tumours

2. Neurological impairment
   - Spinal cord injury (SCI)
     - Trauma
     - Stroke
     - DM neuropathy
     - Epidural abscess
     - Epidural metastasis
     - Multiple sclerosis
     - Guillain-Barre syndrome
   - Genital herpes
     - Sacral nerve involvement

770

3. Ineffective detrusor muscles
   ➡ Post-anesthesia - Leads to bladder overdistension and reduced overlapping between actin and myosin
4. Drug-induced
   ➡ Sympathomimetic - α-adrenergic agents: Phenylephrine - β-adrenergic agents: Terbutaline/ Isoproterenol/ Metaproterenol
   ➡ Anti-cholinergics - Atropine
   ➡ Anti-psychotics
   ➡ Anti-depressants

IV. Pathogenesis

1. Outflow obstruction
   ➡ Flow of urine is impeded by outflow obstruction by mechanical or dynamic factors - Mechanical obstruction refers to physical narrowing of urethral channel - Dynamic obstruction refers to increased muscle tone within and around urethra
2. Neurological impairment
   ➡ Interruption of sensory or motor nerve supply to detrusor muscle
   ➡ Incomplete relaxation of urinary sphincter mechanism (dyssynergia) - ↑ Voiding pressure - ↑ Post-void residual volume
3. Inefficient detrusor muscles
   ➡ Precipitating event leading to an acute distended bladder - Fluid challenge - General or epidural analgesia without an indwelling catheter

V. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Inability to pass urine
   ➡ Lower abdominal or suprapubic discomfort
   ➡ Painful (**acute**) or painless (**chronic**) retention of urine
   [Image: The number 771 is printed in a small font size in the bottom right corner of the page.]

VI. Diagnosis

1. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Differentiate between AROU and anuria

- Shock (e.g. Ruptured AAA)
- Dehydration
- Acute renal failure

2. History taking
   ➡History of presenting illness (HPI)

- Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) - Incomplete emptying/ Urinary frequency/Dribbling/ Urgency/ Weak stream/
  Hesitance/ Nocturia

[A table titled "IPSS Questionnaire" is shown. It's a form with the title "IPSS 總評分 (IPSS Total Score)" at the top and includes several rows of questions related to urinary symptoms, along with a numerical scale for responses. It asks about symptoms like incomplete emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia. Each question is followed by a row of numbers from 0 to 5, allowing respondents to rate the severity or frequency of each symptom. Additional questions about quality of life related to urinary symptoms and their impact on future life quality are also included.]

- Other urinary symptoms
  - Hematuria/ Dysuria
- Neurological symptoms (_spinal cord injury or compression_)
  - Back pain
  - Sensory or motor deficits
- Constitutional symptoms - Weight loss - Anorexia
  ➡ Medical history
- History of prostate diseases
- History of STDs
- History of stroke
- History of malignancy
- History of pelvic trauma
  ➡Surgical history
- History of prostate or pelvic surgery (e.g. hernia)
- History of spinal surgery
  ➡Drug history
- Sympathomimetic
- Anti-cholinergics

  ➡Digital rectal examination (DRE)
- Should be done in both men and women
- Evaluate for prostate enlargement, tenderness and change in consistency
- Evaluate for masses, fecal impaction, perineal sensation and anal sphincter tone
- Precautions - Normal prostate examination does **NOT** exclude BPH as a cause of obstruction - BPH does **NOT** necessarily cause outflow obstruction
  ➡Abdominal examination
- Palpable urinary bladder
- Deep suprapubic palpation will provoke discomfort
  ➡Pelvic examination
- Indicated in women
  ➡Neurological examination (_spinal cord injury or compression_)
- Muscles tone, power, sensation and reflexes
- Urinary and fecal incontinence

4. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Leucocytosis for suspected infection
  ➡Renal function test (RFT)
- Indicated in patient with acute-on-chronic urinary retention to evaluate for renal failure
  ➡ Urinalysis
  ➡Urine culture
  ➡ XXX PSA level
- **NOT** required to check as it is expected to be elevated during an episode of acute retention of urine (AROU)

5. Radiological tests
   ➡ USG bladder

- Confirmation of diagnosis
- Can proceed to catheterization directly if history and physical examination strongly suggest a diagnosis of AROU
  [Image of the number 773 located in the bottom right corner of the page.]

6. Specific tests
   ➡Uroflowmetry

- Investigation of maximal flow, voided volume and residual volume (by USG)
- Precautions
  - Normal maximal flow rate does **NOT** exclude outflow obstruction
  - Uroflowmetry is **NOT** sufficient to diagnose outflow obstruction since it cannot distinguish between outflow obstruction and poor detrusor contractility
    ➡Urodynamic study
- Investigation of
  - Uroflow rate
  - Bladder volume
  - Intravesical and rectal pressure
  - Sphincter function
- Outflow obstruction is characterized by **high** pressure **low** flow

VII. Treatment

1. Bladder decompression
   ➡Urethral catheterization

- Indwelling catheter or clean intermittent catheterization
  - Males: 14 or 16 Fr
  - Females: 12 or 14 Fr
- Assess for first catheterization volume
  - Volume > 500 mL indicates genuine AROU
  - Volume > 1000 mL indicates possible chronic retention of urine
- Contraindications
  - Acute prostatitis
  - Radical prostatectomy
  - Urethral reconstruction
    ➡Suprapubic catheterization
- Indicated in patients who are contraindicated or failed urethral catheterization
- Can lead to bowel perforation, rectal injury and wound infection
- Contraindications
  - Non-distended bladder
  - Uncorrected bleeding tendency
  - Known or suspected urothelial cancer

2. Complications of decompression
   ➡Hematuria
   ➡Urethral stricture
   ➡Urinary tract infections
   ➡Transient hypotension
   ➡Post-obstructive diuresis

- Defined as a diuresis that persists after decompression of bladder
- Represents an appropriate attempt to excrete excess fluid retained during the period of obstruction
- Patients usually can manage the increase in urine output by increasing oral fluid intake
- Isotonic saline replacement is indicated if patients are unable to increase fluid intake

| Effectiveness of treatment | ➡ NO increased risk of failing therapy ➡ Complete cure is likely               | ➡ Increased risk of failing therapy ➡ Curative only if complicating features are removed                                                                                                                           |
| Example                    | ➡ Acute pyelonephritis and cystitis in a young sexually active female          | ➡ Presence of neurogenic bladder, bladder outlet obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux ➡ Underlying conditions such as DM, immunocompromised or pregnancy ➡ Recent hospitalization or presence of indwelling catheter |

Remarks: Males are less prone to UTI and thus it is usually considered complicated when present

➡ Recurrent UTI

- Refers to ≥ 2 infections in 6 months or ≥ 3 infections in 12 months due to reinfection or relapse from a persistent focus
- Reinfection
  - Accounts for the majority of cases
  - Classified when the infecting strain is different from original and the recurrence occurs > 2 weeks of the completion of treatment for original infection
  - Infection by the same organism is impossible to be distinguish between reinfection and relapse
- Relapse
  - Classified when the infecting strain is the same from original and the recurrence occurs ≤ 2 weeks of the completion of treatment for original infection
  - Source of bacterial persistence: Infected urinary stones, infected atrophic kidneys, ureteral stump after nephrectomy, medullary sponge kidney, papillary necrosis, infected urachal cyst, urethral diverticulum and urinary fistula

775

2. Terminology
   ➡Bacteriuria

- Presence of bacteria in urine and does NOT equate infection
- May be result of colonization or contamination of urine sample by bacteria
  ➡ Pyuria
- Presence of WBC in urine and does NOT equate infection
- Indicative of infective or inflammatory response to urinary tract

II. Etiology

1. Risk factors
   ➡Female sex

- Shorter urethral length
  ➡Lack of circumcision
- Mucosal surface of uncircumcised foreskin is more likely to bind uropathogenic bacterial species than keratinized skin on a circumcised penis
- Partial obstruction of urethral meatus by tight foreskin
  ➡Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)
- Retrograde passage of urine from bladder into upper urinary tract
- Important risk factor for renal scarring
  ➡Urinary obstruction
- Stagnancy of urine increases risk of UTI - **Anatomical:** Posterior urethral valves/ Ureteropelvic junction obstruction - **Neurological:** Myelomeningocele with neurogenic bladder - **Functional:** Bladder and bowel dysfunction
  ➡Bladder and bowel dysfunction
- Characterized by - Abnormal elimination pattern (frequent or infrequent voids, daytime wetting, urgency, infrequent stool) - Bladder or bowel incontinence - Withholding maneuver
  ➡Urinary instrumentation
- Bladder catheterization
  ➡Sexual activity

776

2. Risk factors for recurrent UTI
   ➡ Pre-menopausal women

- Genetics
  - Increased susceptibility to vaginal colonization with uropathogens
  - Increased vaginal cells susceptibility of bacterial adherence
- Pelvic anatomy
  - ↓Urethra-to-anus distance
- Sexual activity
  - Frequent sexual intercourse
  - New sexual partners
  - Diaphragm use
  - Spermicide use
- Drug history - Recurrent antimicrobial use (alteration of vaginal flora)
  ➡ Post-menopausal women
- Urinary incontinence
- Post-voiding residual urine
- Presence of cystocele

3. Microbiology
   ➡ Gram +ve bacteria

- Staphylococcus aureus
- Staphylococcus saprophyticus
- Enterococcus
  ➡ Gram -ve bacteria
- Escherichia coli
- Enterobacter
- Klebsiella
- Proteus
- Citrobacter
- Pseudomonas
  ➡ Viruses
- Adenovirus
- Enterovirus
- Echovirus
- Coxsackievirus
  ⇨ Fungi
- Candida
- Aspergillus
- Cryptococcus neoformans

777

III. **Pathogenesis**

1. Natural defence of urinary tract
   Normal flora
   - Altered by antimicrobial use
   - Components
     - Presence of lactobacilli in introitus, vagina and periurethral area produces low pH
     - Production of cervical IgA
       Urine
   - Altered by urinary tract obstruction
   - Components
     - Antegrade flow of urine
     - Normal pH with high osmolality
     - Presence of Tamm-Horsfall protein
       Bladder
   - Altered by urinary tract obstruction, neurogenic bladder, indwelling catheter, vesicoureteral reflux and bladder diverticulum'
   - Components
     - Normal emptying of bladder
     - Normal exfoliation of urothelial cells
     - Receptors on superficial urothelial recognize lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to activate innate immunity and local inflammatory

2. Pathophysiology of UTI
   Colonization of periurethral area by uropathogenic enteric pathogen
   Attachment of pathogens to uroepithelial cells via active process mediated by glycosphingolipid receptors on surface on epithelial cells
   - Bacterial attachment recruits toll-like receptors (TLR) which is a family of transmembrane coreceptors involved in recognition of pathogen-associated protein
   - TLR binding triggers cytokine response and generates local inflammatory response
     Ascend of bacteria into bladder and kidney
   - Bacteria possess pili that adhere effectively to the uroepithelium and ascend into kidney
     - Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) due to incompetence of ureterovesical valve
     - Ureteral obstruction
     - Presence of indwelling catheter

3. Routes of infections
   Ascending spread
   - Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) due to incompetence of ureterovesical valve
   - Ureteral obstruction
   - Presence of indwelling catheter
     Hematogenous spread
   - Secondary infection from extrarenal source of bacteremia
     - Renal abscess from septic emboli
     - Genitourinary tuberculosis (TB)
       Direct extension
   - Direct inoculation from neighbouring suppurative infections

778

# IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms in children
   - Fever without obvious focus\*
   - Foul-smelling urine
   - Cloudy urine
   - Blood in urine (hematuria)
   - Frequent changing of diapers

2. Signs and symptoms in adults

  - Incomplete emptying (retention)
- Intermittent and weak stream
- Straining to void
- Hesitance]

779

V. **Diagnosis**

1. Diagnostic approach
   ➡ General approach - Screening test - Sent for microscopy for pyuria or bacteriuria, dipstick for leukocyte esterase, nitrite and **ANY** positive results should lead to confirmatory tests - Choice of urine collection - Bag urine - Confirmatory test - Sent for microscopy (pyuria/ bacteriuria), leukocyte esterase, nitrite and culture with sensitivity test - Choice of urine collection - < 12 months: Suprapubic aspiration/ Clean-catch urine/ Catheterized urine - > 12 months: Midstream urine/ Clean-catch urine/ Catheterized urine
   ➡ Urine collection methods - **Bag urine** - Send for urinalysis **ONLY** (visual + chemical + microscopic) - Do **NOT** send bag urine specimen for culture since it is prone to contamination by flora around the perineum - **Mid-stream urine (MSU)** - Commonest method done - Prone to contamination particularly in females - **NOT** applicable in young children - Can send for both urinalysis and culture with sensitivity testing - **Clean-catch urine** - Can send for both urinalysis and culture with sensitivity testing - **Urethral catheterization** - **NOT** indicated unless patients are unable to void - Risk of iatrogenic urinary tract infection (UTI) - Can send for both urinalysis and culture with sensitivity testing - **Suprapubic aspiration (SPT)** - Most accurate method - Requires a distended bladder - Indicated in pediatric patients and spinal cord injury with paraplegia - Can send for both urinalysis and culture with sensitivity testing
   ➡ Indications for radiological evaluation - Persistent clinical symptoms after 48 – 72 hours of antibiotic therapy - Repeated episodes of pyelonephritis - Urosepsis - Renal stones - Diabetes mellitus - Immunosuppression - History of urological surgery
2. History taking
   ➡ History of similar attacks or unexplained febrile episodes
   ➡ Antenatal diagnosis of renal abnormality
   ➡ Family history of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or renal disease
   ➡ History of G6PD deficiency (if cotrimoxazole or nitrofurantoin are being used)
   [Image of the number 780 at the bottom right of the page, indicating the page number.]

3. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Vital signs to ensure patient is not septic and assess hydration status
  ➡Abdominal examination
- Suprapubic or flank tenderness
- Ballotable kidneys for hydronephrosis
- Examination of external genitalia
  - **Males**: Look for phimosis
  - **Females**: Look for labial adhesions
    ➡Neurological examination
- Examination of spine and LL movement and reflexes
  - Sacral dimples, pits or fat pads which may indicate neurogenic bladder
  - Sacral hair tufts which may indicate congenital anomalies including spina bifida
    or tether cord syndrome which is associated with neurogenic bladder
    - Nearly **ALL** patients with myelomeningocele have bladder dysfunction
      (neurogenic bladder)

4. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials
   ➡ RFT
   ➡ Serum inflammatory markers

- ↑ ESR and CRP for acute pyelonephritis
  ➡Urine smear and culture
  ➡ Urine dipstick
- Nitrite (more specific)
  - Indicates _bacteriuria_ measured in commercial dipstick
  - Enterobacteriaceae express nitrate reductase which converts urinary nitrate into
    nitrite
  - FN results in Gram +ve or Pseudomonas UTI
- Leukocyte esterase (LE) (more sensitive)
  - Indicates _pyuria_ measured in commercial dipstick
  - Leukocyte esterase is released by lysed neutrophils and macrophages and is a
    marker for the presence of WBC
- Urine specific gravity (SG)
  - Reflects concentration of urine and therefore hydration status
  - SG is defined as the weight of solution compared with weight of an equal volume
    of distilled water
- Urine pH
  - Normal urine pH = 5.5-6.5
  - Alkaline urine suggests infection by urease-producing organisms such as
    Klebsiella, Proteus and Pseudomonas
  - Urea is converted into ammonia which increases urine pH and precipitates the
    formation of urinary stones

➡Urine microscopy

- Pyuria
  - Pyuria is defined as > 2 WBC/ high power field (OR) > 10 WBC/mL
  - Sterile pyuria refers to pyuria without bacteriuria which may indicate TB, partially treated UTI, urinary tract stones, bladder cancer and inflammatory conditions such as interstitial cystitis and ketamine cystitis
  - Pyuria and bacteriuria together suggests genuine UTI
- Bacteriuria
  - Significant bacteriuria refers to ≥ 105 cfu per ml
  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria refers to ≥ 103 cfu per ml in males and ≥ 105 cfu per ml in females and requires screening and treatment ONLY in pregnancy or patients undergoing genitourinary procedure with risk of mucosal bleeding and sepsis
  - Routine screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant patients is due to higher risk of progression into UTI and its association with prematurity and low birth weight
  - Pyuria and bacteriuria together suggests genuine UTI

|        | Uncomplicated UTI | Complicated UTI  |
| :----- | :---------------- | :--------------- |
| Male   |                   | ≥ 104 cfu per ml |

5. Radiological tests

[Image Description: A schematic diagram shows the kidney and ureter with varying degrees of reflux. The diagram shows five different grades of reflux labeled with Roman numerals I to V. Grade I shows reflux only filling the ureter without dilation. Grade II shows reflux fills the ureter and collecting system without dilation. Grade III shows reflux fills and mildly dilates the ureter and collecting system with mild blunting of the calices. Grade IV shows reflux fills and grossly dilates the ureter and collecting system with blunting of the calices, and some tortuosity of the ureter is also present. Grade V shows massive reflux grossly dilates the ureter and collecting system; all the calices are blunted with a loss of papillary impression and intrarenal reflux.]

➡USG renal and bladder (RBUS)

- Non-invasive and without irradiation
- Demonstrate congenital anomalies of kidneys, ureter and bladder
- Look for presence of renal calculi and hydronephrosis
- Does **NOT** reliably demonstrate renal scarring and pyelonephritis
- Perform during first 2 days of treatment to identify renal or perirenal abscess or pyonephrosis associated with obstructive uropathy when clinical illness is unusually severe or there is no clinical improvement
- Perform within 6 weeks if indicated and if there is clinical improvement during treatment of acute infection
  ➡Voiding/Micturition cystourethrogram (VCUG/ MCUG)
- Invasive (catheterization) and has radiation exposure
- Involves catheterization to fill the bladder with radiopaque liquid and recording of VUR during voiding
- Diagnostic test of choice to establish presence and grade the vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) - Grade 1 = Reflux only fills ureter without dilation - Grade 2 = Reflux fills the ureter and collecting system without dilation - Grade 3 = Reflux fills and mildly dilates the ureter and collecting system with mild blunting of the calices - Grade 4 = Reflux fills and grossly dilates the ureter and collecting system with blunting of the calices. Some tortuosity of the ureter is also present. - Grade 5 = Massive reflux grossly dilates the ureter and collecting system. All the calices are blunted with a loss of papillary impression and intrarenal reflux may be present. There is significant ureteral dilation and tortuosity.
  ➡Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan
- Renal scintigraphy using dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) which is injected intravenously and uptake by kidneys
- Detection of renal scarring and pyelonephritis - Areas with decreased uptake of DMSA represent renal scarring or pyelonephritis - Should be performed 6 months after acute infection to detect the formation of scarring which would require follow-up
  ➡CT abdomen
- Detection of anatomic abnormalities
- Detection of process that delay response to therapy including urinary stones, urinary tract obstruction or papillary necrosis
- Diagnose complication of infection such as renal or perinephric abscess
- More sensitive than ultrasound to detect renal abnormalities predisposing or caused by the infection and delineate the extent of disease

➡Subsequent workup after acute infection in children

Summary

➡Indications for MCUG = Abnormal USG/ Recurrent UTI/ Atypical UTI/ Abnormal DMSA
➡Indications for DMSA = VUR ≥ Grade 3/ Recurrent UTI

Definitions (NICE guidelines)

➡ Recurrent UTI

- ≥ 2 episodes of upper UTI
- 1 episode of upper UTI + ≥ 1 episode of lower UTI
- ≥ 3 episodes of lower UTI
  ➡ Atypical UTI

- Infection with non-E. coli organisms

[Image Description: The image shows the number 784 at the bottom right corner of the page.]

VI. Treatment

1. General approach
   ➡ MUST identify underlying G6PD deficiency
   ➡Clinically treat as upper UTI if fever ≥ 38.0°C or loin pain or tenderness

- Upper UTI: Treatment duration = 7-14 days (usually 10 days)
- Lower UTI: Treatment duration = 3 - 5 days
  ➡Treatment regimen in children
- < 3 months or seriously ill
  - IV **Meropenem\*** for 7 - 10 days (OR)
    - Meropenem can be used as 1st line in view of the emergence of ESBL- producing organisms
    - Side effects: Diarrhea/ Nausea/ Convulsion (in < 3 months old)
  - IV Cephalosporin + Aminoglycoside for 7-10 days
- > 3 months and unstable
  - IV antibiotics for 2-4 days if oral antibiotics cannot be used and then followed by oral antibiotics for total of 10 days
  - Usual choices for parenteral therapy include amoxicillin-clavulanate (**Augmentin**)\*/ Ampicillin ± Gentamicin/ 2nd or 3rd generation cephalosporin
- 3 months and stable - Oral antibiotics for 7-10 days - Choices include amoxicillin-clavulanate (**Augmentin**)\*/ Cefuroxime/ Cotrimoxazole (not for < 3 months)
  ➡Patient who does **NOT** show expected clinical response to antibiotics
- Review the diagnosis
- USG kidneys should be performed urgently to rule out renal or perirenal abscess or pyonephrosis associated with obstructive uropathy
- Coexistence of septicaemia and meningitis should be considered

2. Treatment guidelines
   ➡Acute pyelonephritis

- IMPACT guidelines
  - Amoxicillin-clavulanate
- Alternatives - Fluoroquinolones - 3rd generation cephalosporin - Aminoglycosides (Fluoroquinolone-resistant) - Carbapenem (ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae)
  ➡Acute cystitis
- IMPACT guidelines
  - Nitrofurantoin
  - Amoxicillin-clavulanate
- Alternatives - Cotrimoxazole - Fluoroquinolones
  ➡Acute prostatitis
- Fluoroquinolones

[Image Description: The image is a page from a medical document. It outlines the treatment guidelines for various types of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children and adults, including pyelonephritis, cystitis, and prostatitis. It details the medications and treatment durations recommended for each condition, further differentiating by age group and severity of illness.]

785

3. Medical treatment
   ➡Penicillin

- Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin)
  - Effective in treating Enterococcus infection
  - Generally administered orally since it is better absorbed from the GIT than ampicillin and cause less diarrhea
- Ampicillin
  - Effective in treating Enterococcus infection
  - Generally administered intravenously (IV) since it has a relatively poor oral bioavailability
  - NOT routinely recommended for empirical therapy due to high rate of resistance
  - Can use vancomycin if ampicillin resistant
    ➡Fluoroquinolones
- Indicated in patients with penicillin and cephalosporin allergy
- **Example:** Ciprofloxacin
  ➡Carbapenems
- IV meropenem indicated for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae if ill
  ➡ Cotrimoxazole (Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) (Septrin)
- Indicated in patients with penicillin and cephalosporin allergy
- Aware of G6PD deficiency which may increase risk of hemolytic anemia
- Should not be used for young baby
  ➡Nitrofurantoin
- Aware of G6PD deficiency which may increase risk of hemolytic anemia
- Should not be used for young baby
  ➡3rd generation cephalosporin
- Should not be used as monotherapy (with aminoglycoside)
- **NOT** effective in treating Enterococcus infection
  - Enterococcus is intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins and aminoglycoside and therefore should use Augmentin or nitrofurantoin
- **Example:** Cefotaxime/ Ceftriaxone/ Cefixime/ Cefpodoxime/ Ceftibuten/ Cefdinir
  ➡Aminoglycosides
- Should not be used as monotherapy (with 3rd generation cephalosporin)
- **NOT** effective in treating Enterococcus infection
  - Enterococcus is intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins and aminoglycoside and therefore should use Augmentin or nitrofurantoin
- **Example:** Gentamicin/ Amikacin

786

4. Surgical treatment
   ➡Indications for surgical referral

- Recurrence of UTI (2nd episode) + VUR > Grade 3 + Significant scarring on DMSA
- Recurrence of UTI (3rd episode) despite antibiotic prophylaxis + VUR > Grade 3
- **NOT** suggested for patients with Grade 1 and 2 VUR since there is a high likelihood of spontaneous resolution and low risk of renal scarring
  ➡Reimplantation (Open surgical/Robotic-assisted laparoscopic)
- Ureters are reimplanted by tunnelling a ureteral segment through the detrusor muscle thereby creating a submucosal tunnel that is long enough to act as a flap valve
- Intravesical (bladder is opened) and extravesical approach (bladder not opened) which is associated with shorter hospital stay
  ➡Endoscopic correction
- Less invasive ambulatory procedure which injects a peri-urethral bulking agent via a cystoscope which changes the angle and fixation of intravesical ureter
- Hydrodistension implantation technique (HIT)
  - Places the bulking agent within the ureteral tunnel
- Subureteral transurethral injection (STING)
  - Places the bulking agent outside ureteral orifice

VII. Prevention

1. Behavioral changes
   ➡Lifestyle modification

- Liberal fluid intake to increase micturition
- Avoid use of spermicide-containing products
- Post-coital voiding

2. Antibiotic prophylaxis
   ➡Indications of prophylaxis in **children**

- Antibiotic prophylaxis should **NOT** be routinely prescribed to young children with first episode of UTI
- Prophylactic antibiotics with cotrimoxazole indicated if VUR Grade ≥ 3
- Prophylactic antibiotics with Zinnat (Cefuroxime) 10 mg/kg when MCUG is performed
  ➡Different types of antibiotic prophylaxis
- Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis
  - Use of cotrimoxazole or nitrofurantoin
- Post-coital prophylaxis
  - Single post-coital dose may be a more efficiency and acceptable method of prevention than continuous prophylaxis
  - Indicated in women whose UTIs appears to be temporally related to sexual intercourse
- Intermittent self-treatment
  - Indicated in women who prefer to minimize their intake of antimicrobials
  - Patients should be candidates for self-diagnosis and self-treatment

# Urological Diseases

Urinary stones (Renal/ Ureteric/ Bladder stones)

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Renal and ureteric stones present with classical symptoms of hematuria and renal colic

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ **Male** predominance (M:F = 3:1)
   ➡ Majority occurs at 40 – 60s

III. Etiology

1. Risk factors
   ➡ Anatomical factors (Urinary tract abnormalities) - Medullary sponge kidneys - Horseshoe kidneys
   ➡ Medical conditions - Formation of calcium stones - Primary hyperparathyroidism (leading to hypercalciuria) - Sarcoidosis - Idiopathic hypercalciuria - Inflammatory bowel disease - Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) Type I (Distal) - Formation of uric acid stones - Gout (hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria) - Lymphoproliferative/ Myeloproliferative disease - Previous history of urinary stones
   ➡ Surgical history - Gastric bypass surgery/ Bowel resection - Result of increased oxalate excretion in urine - Dietary Ca2+ is bound by unabsorbed dietary fats by saponification after bypass which prevents it from binding to dietary oxalate, thereby making oxalate more available for intestinal absorption and increase oxalate excretion
   ➡ Family history - Family history of urinary stones
   ➡ Urinary factors - **High** calcium (hypercalciuria), oxalate (hyperoxaluria), cystine (cystinuria), uric acid (hyperuricosuria) and high pH (calcium oxalate and struvite stones) - **Low** volume and citrate (hypocitraturia) and low pH (uric acid and cystine stones) - Hypocitraturia is usually caused by metabolic acidotic states (e.g. RTA) which enhances renal tubular absorption of citrate
   ➡ Dietary factors - **High** oxalate, protein and sodium intake - High protein intake leads to hyperuricosuria - **Low** fluid intake (dehydration) and calcium - Low calcium diet is paradoxically predisposing to urinary stones formation since it will bind will oxalate in GIT to prevent its absorption into blood and subsequently excretion in urine

[Image Description: This is a page from a medical textbook discussing Urological Diseases, specifically Urinary Stones. It is divided into three main sections: Overview, Epidemiology, and Etiology. Under Overview, it mentions the general features of renal and ureteric stones causing hematuria and renal colic. The Epidemiology section notes male predominance in urinary stone cases and their common occurrence between 40-60 years of age. The Etiology section lists various risk factors including anatomical, medical (such as calcium and uric acid stone formation), surgical, family history, urinary factors (like high calcium or low volume), and dietary factors (such as high oxalate or low fluid intake).]

788

IV. **Pathogenesis**

1. Pathophysiology
   ➡Anatomical places of ureteric narrowing predisposing to lodging of kidney stones

- Pelvic-ureteric junction (PUJ): Where renal pelvis joins the ureter
- Pelvic inlet: Where ureter cross the pelvic brim near bifurcation of common iliac artery
- Bladder entrance (VUJ): Where ureter pierce the urinary bladder

2. Different types of urinary stones
   ➡ 5 types of urinary stones

3. Formation of urinary stones
   ➡ Supersaturation

- Stone formation occurs when normally soluble material such as calcium and oxalate supersaturate the urine and begins crystal formation
- Crystals aggregates become large enough to be anchored usually at the end of collecting ducts and slowly increase in size over time
  - Anchoring is thought to occur at sites of epithelial cell injury induced by the crystals themselves
    ➡ Urinary tract infection (UTI)
    ➡ Drug-induced

[Image Description: The image shows a table with the different types of urinary stones and their characteristics. The table has four columns: "Types", "Urine", "Radiopaque", and "Remarks". The "Types" column lists the different types of stones: Calcium oxalate (75%), Struvite (Magnesium ammonium phosphate/Calcium carbonate-apatite) (15%), Uric acid (5%), Cystine (2%), and Drug-induced. The "Urine" column indicates whether the urine is alkaline or acidic for each stone type. The "Radiopaque" column shows whether the stones are radiopaque (visible on X-ray). The "Remarks" column provides additional information about each type of stone, such as being the most common, associated with infection, or drug-induced. The table describes the urine pH and radiopacity for each stone type, along with key characteristics. For example, struvite stones are strongly alkaline and associated with urease-producing organisms, leading to staghorn stones. Uric acid stones are found in acidic urine and are not radiopaque. Drug-induced stones are also not radiopaque and include Indinavir, which is invisible even on CT scans, and Triamterene, which is poorly radiopaque.]

V. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Abdominal or flank pain

- **Site**: Flank pain
  - Pain occurs primarily from urinary obstruction with distention of the renal capsule and the ureter
  - Renal pelvic or upper ureteral obstruction leads to flank pain
  - Lower ureteral obstruction leads to pain radiating to ipsilateral testicles or labium
- **Onset**: Develop in waves or paroxysms related to movement of stone in the ureter and associated ureteral spasm
- **Character**: Varies from a mild and barely noticeable ache to intense discomfort that requires analgesics
- **Radiation**: To penis, ipsilateral testicles and labium
- **Associated symptoms**: Gross or microscopic hematuria **without** abdominal tenderness
- **Time course**: Lasts for 20 - 60 mins
- **Relieving factors**: Passage of urinary stones
  ➡Hematuria
- Single most discriminating predictor of a renal stone in patients presenting with unilateral flank pain
- Absence of hematuria does **NOT** exclude the presence of nephrolithiasis since hematuria is not detected in 10 – 30% of patients with documented nephrolithiasis
  ➡Urinary symptoms
- Frequency
- Urgency
- Dysuria
- Difficulty urinating
  ➡Constitutional symptoms
- Nausea and vomiting

3. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Urinary system

- Pyelonephritis
  - Frequently presents with fever, flank pain and pyuria
  - Fever is uncommon in patients with renal stones unless it is complicated
- Renal cell carcinoma - Bleeding within the kidney can produce blood clots which lodge temporarily in the ureter leading to renal colic - Glomerular bleeding does **NOT** lead to clot formation or symptoms of renal colic
  ➡Abdominal system
- Intestinal obstruction
- Acute diverticulitis
- Acute appendicitis
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm
  ➡Gynecological system
- Dysmenorrhea
  - Rarely presents with flank pain that begins just before or concurrent with the onset of menstruation
- Ectopic pregnancy
  - Underlying cause of pain can be clarified by obtaining a renal or pelvic USG

VI. Diagnosis

1. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials
   - Mild leukocytosis
     ➡ Clotting profile
   - Preoperative baseline to look for underlying bleeding diathesis
     ⇨ RFT
     ➡ Urinalysis
   - Look for microscopic hematuria, pyuria and bacteriuria
   - Look for presence of crystals
   - Urine smear, culture with sensitivity testing
     ➡ Serum Ca2+ and PO43- level
     ➡ Serum uric acid level

2. Radiological test
   ⇨ KUB
   - ONLY identify sufficiently large radiopaque stones such as calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, struvite and cystine stones
   - Miss radiolucent stones (10%) such as uric acid stones or drug-induced stones (e.g. indinavir) and stones overlying bony structures
   - Unable to detect urinary tract obstruction
   - Course of ureter in KUB
     - Travels along medial aspect of psoas muscle and lies anterior and slightly medial to the tip of L2-L5 transverse process
     - Enters the pelvis anterior to SI joint at the bifurcation of common iliac vessels
     - Course anteriorly to internal iliac artery down to lateral pelvic sidewall
     - Turns forward and medially at the level of ischial spine and enter the posterolateral wall of the urinary bladder before opening into bladder at the internal ureteric orifice

791

➡Ultrasound (USG) kidney and bladder

- Acceptable initial screening test in particular for patients who should avoid radiation
  including pregnant women and women of childbearing age
- Detect urinary tract obstruction and radiolucent stones that is missed on KUB
- Detect complications of stone such as hydronephrosis
- May miss small stones and ureteral stones
  ➡ Non-contrast CT scan (NCCT)\*
- **Imaging modality of choice (1st line)** in patients with urinary stones
  - Even if KUB is negative it has to be followed up with NCCT anyways as KUB
    miss 10% of stones
  - KUB is still important which serves as a baseline for future FU of patients after
    treatment (_do not perform NCCT every time for FU_)
- Higher sensitive than USG and thus more likely to visualize a stone
- Detects both urinary stones and secondary signs of urinary tract obstruction such as
  ureteral dilatation, collecting system dilatation and perinephric stranding
- Determination of stone composition by stone density, local and general appearance
  - Dense radiopacity = Calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones
  - Less dense radiopacity = Struvite and cystine stones
  - Radiolucency = Uric acid stones
  - Bilateral calcification at corticomedullary junction is seen in medullary sponge
    kidney in which calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones are likely
  - Large calculi in renal pelvis is seen in struvite stones
    ➡CT urogram (CTU)
- Evaluate for pelvicalyceal system
- Reflects renal function while evaluating for gross anatomical abnormalities
- CTU include a delayed (urogram) phase to outline the ureter
  ➡Radionuclide studies (MAG-3/ DTPA renogram)
- Provides both anatomical and functional information
  - Use of radioisotope technetium Tc-99m mertiatide (Tc-99mMAG3) to assess
    renal excretory function
- Preferred modality of imaging in infants and children because of reduced radiation
  exposure compared with CT (_not in this case since children rarely presents with stones_)
- Role in radiological assessment of renal disease
  - Differentiate between obstructive and non-obstructive hydronephrosis
  - Identify difference in function between two kidneys
- Role in workup of urinary stones
  - Indicated in patients presenting with complications due to prolonged obstruction
    and requiring measurement of renal function
  - Assist surgical management since kidney with < 15% of total renal function
    (normal 50% each side) is non-functional and not worth salvaging
  - Proceed to PCNL for preserved functional kidney function whereas nephrectomy
    may be indicated for non-functional kidney
    792

VII. Treatment

1. Conservative management
   ➡Adequate hydration

- Likelihood that ureteral stones will pass depends on size and location of stone
- Smaller and distal stones are more likely to pass without interventions - More than 70% of stones < 5 mm in diameter passes spontaneously - Up to 40% of stones < 10 mm in diameter passes spontaneously - Stones > 10 mm in diameter in unlikely to pass
  ➡Dietary modification
- **NORMAL** calcium diet (in fact patients with high dietary Ca²⁺ have less episodes of urolithiasis)
- ↓ Intake of high protein food (e.g. red meat, internal organs)
- ↓ Intake of high oxalate food (e.g. peanuts, spinach, beetroot, strawberries)
- ↓ Intake of salt (sodium)
- ↑ Intake of dietary fibers (e.g. fruits, wheat, corn)
  ➡Chemical dissolution
- Alkalization of urine
  - Indicated in uric acid or cystine stones
    - **Example:** Potassium citrate or baking soda
- Acidification of urine - Indicated in struvite stones (calcium stones cannot be dissolved)
  ➡Straining urine
- Patient is instructed to strain their urine for several days and bring in any stones that passes for analysis
- Enable clinician to better plan preventive therapy

2. Medical treatment
   ➡ NSAIDs

- 1st line pain treatment but require RFT to look for deranged renal function
- Indicated for pain control of patients with acute renal colic
- NSAIDs have the possible advantage of decreasing ureteral smooth muscle tone thereby directly treatment the mechanism (ureteral spasm) by which pain is thought to occur - **Example:** Indomethacin/ Ketorolac
  ➡ Opioids
- Indicated for pain control of patients with acute renal colic who has deranged RFT - **Example:** Morphine/ Pethidine/ Tramadol
  ➡ Medical expulsive therapy (MET)
- Indicated for patients with stones of 5 - 10 mm
- Use of appropriate medical therapy to facilitate stone passage by 29% with a prerequisite that the patient is reasonably comfortable with the therapeutic approach and there is no obvious advantage of immediate active stone removal
- Spontaneous passage of stone may take up to 3-4 weeks
- a-blockers\* and CCB increases passage rate of urinary stones
  - **α-blockers:** Tamsulosin
  - CCB: Nifedipine

793

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Indications for surgical treatment
   _ Symptomatic
   _ Persistent pain
   _ Unresolved with conservative treatment
   _ Too large to pass spontaneously
   _ Failure to pass after 4 – 6 weeks
   _ Presence of complications
   _ Hematuria due to damage of renal tissues
   _ Urinary tract infection (UTI)
   _ Obstructive uropathy (Obstructed solitary kidney/ Bilateral obstruction)
   _ Acute kidney injury (AKI)

|                 | 10–20 mm | ➡ ESWL for non-lower pole                            |
|                 |          | ➡ PCNL for lower pole (unfavorable location only)    |
|                 | > 20 mm  | ➡ PCNL                                               |
|                 |          | ➡ RIRS (i.e. flexible URSL)                          |
|                 |          | ➡ Open pyelolithotomy/ nephrolithotomy (rarely done) |
| Upper ureter    | < 5 mm   | ➡ Conservative unless symptomatic or persistent      |
|                 | 5–10 mm  | ➡ ESWL                                               |
|                 | > 10 mm  | ➡ URSL                                               |

|                 |          | ➡ URSL (preferred)                                   |
|                 | > 20 mm  | ➡ Open ureterolithotomy (rarely done)                |
| Bladder         | < 30 mm  | ➡ Cystolitholapaxy                                   |
|                 | > 30 mm  | ➡ Open cystolithotomy                                |

Remarks: Definitive treatment should be initiated **ONLY** when an acute episodes of urosepsis (if present) has resolved

➡ Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)

- Minimally invasive technique that does not require anesthesia
- Employs high energy shock wave produced by electrical discharge for stone fragmentation
- Patients will often undergo multiple procedures to be rendered stone free given the lower efficacy rate of ESWL compared with PCNL and URSL
- Limitations
  - Subject to skin-to-stone disease leads to poorer efficacy in obese patients
  - NOT ideal for large or hard calculi such as cystine, calcium oxalate monohydrate stones or brushite stones (unique form of calcium phosphate stone)
    - Predicted on CT scan as being very hyperintense
  - NOT ideal for stones in unfavourable location such as in lower pole of kidney, mid to distal ureter or within calyceal diverticulum
  - NOT ideal in patients with complex renal anatomy such as horseshoe kidneys
- Contraindications
  - Pregnancy
  - Active UTI or urosepsis
  - Uncontrolled bleeding diathesis
  - Obstruction (i.e. stricture) distal to stones
- Complications
  - Incomplete fragmentation
  - Urosepsis
  - Perinephric or subcapsular hematoma\*
  - Ureteric obstruction by stone fragments (Steinstrasse - “stone street”)\*

795

➡Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)

- Procedures
  - Antibiotics on induction **MUST** be given in PCNL
    - Stone is usually infectious
    - Antibiotics should target Pseudomonas such as use of piperacillin, ticarcillin, aminoglycoside and some of the 3rd generation cephalosporin
  - Performed through a percutaneous needle puncture to gain access into kidneys
    - Ideal puncture at the lower pole, posterior calyx (takes advantage of bloodless plane) and transpapillary directed towards renal pelvis (avoids infundibular puncture)
    - Supracostal puncture above 12th rib enables access to upper pole and most of the calyces but is associated with thoracic complications requiring chest drain in 7% of cases
  - Dilatation of tract
    - Alken's dilator system or balloon dilator
  - Entry of nephroscope with energy source such as laser or ultrasound to fragment and aspirate large renal calculi
  - ± Placement of a nephrostomy tube
    - Allow postoperative drainage from pelvicalyceal system that has been expanded or injured during PCNL since the normal route (PUJ/ ureter) will likely to be inflamed and obstructed
    - Provide access for second look PCNL
- Indications
  - Large calculi > 2 cm in diameter
  - Hard stones (cystine or calcium oxalate monohydrate stones)
  - Stones in unfavourable location such as lower pole of kidney, mid to distal ureter or within calyceal diverticulum
  - Anatomical abnormalities such as horseshoe kidney or PUJ obstruction
- Contraindications
  - Uncontrolled bleeding diathesis
  - Patient unfit for GA (Requires anesthesia)
- Complications
  - Access failure (5%)
  - Incomplete fragmentation
  - Urosepsis
  - Bleeding from puncture tract
    - Bleeding requiring transfusion (7%)
  - Hydrothorax (perforation of adjacent organs)\*
    - If the supracostal puncture tract used to access the kidneys traverses the lower aspect of the pleura then large amount of irrigating fluid will result in hydrothorax
  - Bowel perforation (perforation of adjacent organs)\*
  - Mortality (< 0.5%)
    796

➡ Ureterorenoscopic lithotripsy (URSL)

- Treatment of choice for stones in middle and lower ureteral stones
- Use of rigid or semi-rigid ureteroscopy which is passed to the level of calculus
- Small stones can be extracted by baskets or grasping forceps
- Large stone are fragmented prior to removal with ultrasonic, laser (Holmium: YAG), ballistic/ pneumatic (Lithoclast) or electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL)

➡ Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) (i.e. flexible URSL)

- Direct fragmentation of stones with flexible ureterorenoscope and intracorporeal lithotripter
- Deflection capabilities of ureteroscope allows access to the entire upper urinary tract including the intrarenal collecting system
- Indicated for stones in intrarenal collecting system as last resort if PCNL is contraindicated
- Independent of body habitus and can be used in patients with bleeding diathesis
- Complications
  - Incomplete fragmentation
  - Urosepsis
    - Endoscopic irrigation can force bacteria into renal parenchyma and result in sepsis if performed in the setting of infection
  - Urinary tract infection (UTI)\*
  - Ureteric stricture\*
  - Ureteric injury and avulsion\*

➡ Adjuncts for urinary drainage

- Internal drainage by JJ stent or external drainage by PCN
- Indications
  - Uncontrolled pain
  - Uncontrolled urosepsis
  - Pyonephrosis (NOT pyelonephritis)
  - Renal failure (Deteriorating renal function)
  - Following fragmentation of stone > 2 cm to reduce risk of obstruction by stone fragments so as to ensure good drainage after surgery

# Nephrology Diseases

# Polycystic kidney disease (PKD)

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) - Also known as adult polycystic kidney disease - Characterized by cystic dilatation in all parts of nephron - Progressive formation of epithelial-lined cyst in kidneys - Enormous growth of cysts leads to loss of normal surrounding tissues and loss of renal function - Extrarenal cysts such as hepatic and pancreatic cysts favors the diagnosis - Majority of patients (85%) have an abnormality on chromosome 16 (PKD1 locus) - Remaining patients have an abnormality on chromosome 4 (PKD2 locus) - Less severe phenotype with cysts and ESRD occurring later in life
   ➡ Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) - Also known as infantile polycystic kidney disease - Characterized by cystic dilatation of the renal collecting ducts - Portal fibrosis, portal hypertension, cholangitis or biliary dysgenesis favors the diagnosis - Developmental defects of hepatobiliary ductal plate remodelling which result in varying degree of congenital hepatic fibrosis - Genetic abnormalities on PKHD1 gene

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ Incidence - Incidence of ADPKD = 1 in 400 – 1000 live births - Incidence of ARPKD = 1 in 20,000 live births

III. Etiology

1. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Multiple benign simple cysts - Relative common in general population and increases in number with age - Simple renal cysts are uncommon in patients < 30 years old - Simple renal cysts are rarely multiple and bilateral
   ➡ Localized renal cystic disease - Benign condition that is neither bilateral nor progressive
   ➡ Acquired renal cystic disease - Chronic renal failure particularly patients on maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is frequently associated with development of multiple and bilateral small cysts - Easily distinguished from ADPKD since there is no family history of ADPKD and the kidneys are usually small to normal in size with a smooth contour and the absence of extrarenal features of ADPKD
   ➡ Medullary sponge kidney - Characterized by tubular dilatation of collecting ducts confined to medullary pyramids with sparing of the renal cortex
   ➡ Other genetic disorders - Tuberous sclerosis complex (AD) - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (AD)

799

IV. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Polyuria, nocturia, urinary frequency, increased thirst

- Decreased urinary concentrating ability is one of the earliest manifestation
- Renal concentrating defect is closely related to severity of anatomical deformities induced by the cyst
- Increased vasopressin secretion as a compensatory response to preserve water balance
  ➡ Hematuria
- Gross hematuria occurs in 35 – 50% of patients and can be the presenting symptom
  - Result of rupture of a cyst into the collecting system
  - Conservative management includes bedrest, hydration and analgesics
  - Percutaneous arterial embolization or nephrectomy if persistent and severe bleeding occurs
- Microscopic hematuria occurs in nephrolithiasis - Resolves following passage or removal of stone
  ➡ Flank or back pain
- Occurs in 60% of patients with ADPKD
- Pain may result from renal cyst infection, hemorrhage, nephrolithiasis or progressive renal enlargement
- Dull and persistent pain reflecting stretching of the capsule or traction on renal pedicle

V. **Diagnosis**

1. Diagnostic criteria
   ➡ Screening and diagnosis in individuals with +ve family history

- USG criteria is less sensitive for patients with PKD2 mutation because of the late onset
  - Direct testing for the known mutation in patients with at-risk PKD2 mutation may be more cost-effective than USG

|           | Type 1 ADPKD                            | Unknown genotype / Type 2 ADPKD                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Age 15–29 | ≥ 2 Unilateral or bilateral renal cysts | Age 15–39 ≥ 3 Unilateral or bilateral renal cysts |
| Age 30–59 | ≥ 2 Renal cysts in each kidney          | Age 40–59 ≥ 2 Renal cysts in each kidney          |
| Age ≥ 60  | ≥ 4 Renal cysts in each kidney          | Age ≥ 60 ≥ 4 Renal cysts in each kidney           |

➡ Screening and diagnosis in individuals with -ve family history

- **NO** definitive number of cysts or cyst location that provides definite diagnosis
- Diagnosis should be strongly suspected if
  - Presence of multiple and bilateral cysts which is arbitrarily defined as ≥ 10 cysts in each kidney
  - Presence of renal enlargement or liver cyst
  - Absence of findings suggestive of a different renal cystic disease

2. History taking
   ➡History of presenting illness (HPI)

- Polyuria/ Nocturia/ Frequency/Thirst
- Hematuria
- Flank or back pain
- Headache (suggests ICA)
  ➡ Medical history
- **CVS**: Hypertension/ Intracranial aneurysm/ Stroke/ Valvular heart disease
- **GI**: Liver cyst/ Pancreatic cyst/ Colonic diverticulum/ Abdominal wall hernia
- **UG**: Renal stones

3. Physical examination
   ➡BP measurement

- Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is crucial
- Present is in majority of patients who have normal renal function and reached the 40s
- Occurs early prior to loss of kidney function and is associated with progressive renal disease
  ➡Abdominal examination
- Hepatomegaly
- Bilateral ballotable kidneys
- Abdominal wall hernia

4. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Anemia/ Erythrocytosis - Anemia due to hematuria or chronic renal failure - Erythrocytosis due to compensatory increase in EPO production
  ➡ RFT
- Assess and monitor development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
- Renal function usually remains normal until the 40s
  ➡ Urinalysis
- Hematuria
- Proteinuria - NOT a major features of ADPKD and usually reflects a superimposed glomerular disease if present
  ➡Genetic testing
- Indicated in patients with unequivocal imaging or when a definite diagnosis is required

5. Radiological tests
   ➡ USG kidney

- Indicated in screening of asymptomatic individuals with positive family history
- Enlarge kidneys and extensive cysts scattered throughout both kidneys
  ➡CT/T2W MRI with or without contrast of kidney
- More sensitive than USG in detecting cyst of smaller size
- Not usually preferred due to potential contrast nephropathy and allergic reactions in patient with CKD
  ➡CT with contrast of brain
- Initial diagnostic test for intracranial aneurysm

801

VI. **Treatment**

1. General approach
   - Non-pharmacological treatment
     - Dietary sodium restriction < 2 g/day
     - Increased fluid intake
       - Suppress vasopressin level which is postulated to be a therapeutic mechanic to inhibit cystic growth in ADPKD

2. Medical treatment
   _ ACEI/ ARB
   _ BP control to a target of 140/90 mmHg
   _ Do **NOT** maintain SBP to 110 mmHg in patients with moderate or advanced disease since it may increase the risk of renal disease progression by reducing renal blood flow
   _ Control of BP can prevent progression of renal disease and decreases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity
   _ ACEI should be the 1st line anti-hypertensive unless contraindicated
   _ Increased RAAS activity and extracellular volume expansion is involved in pathogenesis of hypertension in patients with ADPKD
   _ ARB should be considered in patients intolerant of ACEI due to dry cough or angioedema
   _ Statins
   _ Treatment of hyperlipidemia in patients with ADPKD who have reduced renal function
   _ Antibiotics
   _ Lipid-soluble antibiotics against Gram -ve enteric organisms are preferred for cyst infection
   _ Requires 4 – 6 weeks of treatment \* Example: Cotrimoxazole/ Fluoroquinolones
   [Image Description: This page presents information about ADPKD, starting with the title "VI. Treatment". It has two main sections: "1. General approach" and "2. Medical treatment". The "General approach" section mentions "Non-pharmacological treatment" and lists "Dietary sodium restriction < 2 g/day" and "Increased fluid intake". A sub-bullet indicates suppressing vasopressin level to inhibit cystic growth in ADPKD. The "Medical treatment" section covers "ACEI/ARB" with a target BP of 140/90 mmHg, emphasizing NOT to maintain SBP at 110 mmHg in advanced cases to avoid progression of renal disease. It also states that ACEI is the first-line anti-hypertensive and ARB should be considered for patients intolerant to ACEI. Finally, it mentions treatment with "Statins" for hyperlipidemia and the use of "Antibiotics," specifically lipid-soluble antibiotics, for cyst infection, requiring 4-6 weeks of treatment, with "Cotrimoxazole/ Fluoroquinolones" given as an example. The number 802 is at the bottom right of the page.]

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡Nephrectomy

- Should be avoided whenever possible in ADPKD
- Most often considered for pain that is constant and requires narcotic medications or is associated with reduced QOL extending over periods of time
- Indications of nephrectomy
  - Chronic pain
  - Chronic hematuria requiring transfusion
  - Recurrent cyst infections or UTI
  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
  - Uncontrolled renal hemorrhage in patients contraindicated to or failure with intra- arterial embolization
  - Marked limitation of daily activities such as fatigue, anorexia and other signs of malnutrition

➡Hemodialysis

- Renal replacement therapy for patients with ESRD
- Peritoneal dialysis is less commonly performed since it is difficult for patients to accommodate large volumes of dialysate fluid in the setting of enlarged kidneys and increased risk of peritonitis secondary to cyst infection as well as abdominal hernia

➡Renal transplantation

- Renal replacement therapy for patients with ESRD
- Patient with very large polycystic kidneys and recurrent renal cyst infection may require pre-transplant nephrectomy or bilateral nephrectomy to accommodate the allograft and reduce the pain
- Patient should be screened for presence of intracranial aneurysm before surgery due to possible hemodynamic instability

803

VII. **Complication**

1. Renal complication
   ➡ Kidney stones (Nephrolithiasis)

- Occurs in up to 25% of patients
- Most of the stones are composed of uric acid and the remaining is calcium oxalate
  ➡ End-stage renal disease (ESRD)
- Requires renal replacement therapy such as hemodialysis or renal transplantation

2. Extrarenal complications
   ➡ Hypertension

- Result from increased activation of RAAS or increased sympathetic nerve activity
- Present is in majority of patients who have normal renal function and reached the 40s
- Occurs early prior to loss of kidney function (reduction in GFR)
- Risk factor for both cardiovascular and kidney disease progression in ADPKD
  ➡ Cerebral aneurysms
- Ruptured cerebral aneurysm resulting in _subarachnoid_ or intracerebral hemorrhage is the **MOST** serious complication of PKD
- Screening with CTA or MRA is offered
  - High-risk patients include those with previous rupture, positive family history of aneurysm, high occupational risk and patients requiring chronic anticoagulation
- Indications for intervention - Asymptomatic small aneurysm < 7 mm (Asian < 5 mm) generally required observation only without intervention due to low risk of hemorrhage - Asymptomatic aneurysm of ≥ 7 – 10 mm (Asian ≥ 5 mm) warrants strong consideration for treatment taking into account the patient's age, existing medical and neurological conditions and risks of treatment - Large symptomatic aneurysm requires treatment and is cost-effective
  ➡ Cardiac valve disease
- **MOST** common abnormalities include MVP and AR
- Less frequent lesions include TVP, MR and TR
- Murmurs may not be audible but only demonstrated on echocardiogram
- Majority of patients are asymptomatic but some may progress and require valve replacement
  ➡ Liver cysts
- Liver cyst derived from biliary epithelium is the **MOST** common extrarenal complication
- Massive cysts occurs almost exclusively in women particularly those who have had several pregnancy
- Polycystic liver disease (PLD) associated with ADPKD is different from autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD) - ADPLD has no or only a few renal cysts and does not progress to renal failure - ADPLD is caused by mutation in at least 2 distinct gene (PRKCSH and SEC63)
  ➡ Pancreatic cysts
- Occurs in 7 – 10% of patients with ADPKD
  ➡ Colonic diverticulum
- Colonic diverticular are found in many ADPKD patients on maintenance dialysis but may not occur in those without ESRD
  ➡ Abdominal wall and inguinal hernia
- Both abdominal wall and inguinal hernia are found with increased frequency in ADPKD patients

804

3. Complications of the cysts
   ➡Infected renal cysts and pyelonephritis

- Second most common cause of death in patients with ADPKD
- Correlates with the structural abnormality of the renal parenchyma
  ➡Rupture and hemorrhage of renal cysts
- Presents with hematuria

VIII. Prognosis

1. Prognosis of PKD
   ➡Most patients die from cardiac causes

- Cardiac hypertrophy and coronary disease accounts for majority of cases

V. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms (Triad (9%) = **Hematuria** + **Flank pain** + **Palpable abdominal renal mass**)
   ➡Hematuria

- Only observed with tumour invasion into the collecting system
- May lead to blood clot formation and colicky discomfort when bleeding is severe
  ➡Abdominal mass
- Abdominal or flank mass which is associated with lower pole tumour is more commonly palpated in the thin adult
- Mass is generally firm, homogenous, non-tender and moves with respiration
  ➡Abdominal pain
  - Flank pain
    ➡Constitutional symptoms
  - Fever
  - Night sweats
  - Anorexia and weight loss
  - Fatigue
  - Cachexia

2. Paraneoplastic symptoms\* (10 – 40%)
   ➡Hepatic abnormalities

- Stauffer syndrome - Paraneoplastic syndrome associated with malignancy can induce a reversible form of cholestasis leading to↑ ALP - Benign elevation of liver enzymes usually resolves after tumour removal
  ➡Hematological abnormalities
- Anemia
  - Normochromic or microcytic anemia
  - Anemia of chronic (kidney) disease with↓ EPO
- Erythrocytosis
  - Constitutive production of erythropoietin (EPO) by tumour
  - Impaired degradation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors under normoxic conditions in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
- Thrombocytosis - Related to IL-6 production by the tumour
  ➡Endocrine abnormalities
- Hypertension
  - Renin overproduction can present as hypertension
- Hypercalcemia - Overproduction of PTHrP (enhanced by concurrent IL-6 production) - Lytic bone metastasis - ↑ Production of prostaglandins that promote bone resorption
  ➡ Others
- AA amyloidosis
- Polymyalgia rheumatica

809

3. Signs and symptoms of complications
   ➡Varicoceles

- Occurs in as much as 11% of men with RCC
- Scrotal varicoceles arise when kidney tumour obstructs the gonadal vein where it enters the renal vein
- Majority of varicoceles are left-sided - Left gonadal vein drains into left renal vein - Right gonadal vein drains directly into IVC
  ➡IVC involvement (thrombosis)
- Cavoatrial tumour involvement refers to thrombus involving the IVC or RA occurs in less than 10% of all cases
- Four stages of cavoatrial tumour involvement
  - Level I = Thrombus < 2 cm above renal vein
  - Level II = Thrombus below the intrahepatic vena cava
  - Level III = Thrombus involves intrahepatic vena cava but is below diaphragm
  - Level IV = Thrombus involves the atrium
- Simple thrombectomy is sufficient for thrombus extending up to major hepatic veins
- Cardiopulmonary bypass with or without hypothermic circulatory arrest is required for thrombus extends above major hepatic veins

VI. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Ankle edema - IVC thrombosis or venous compression from tumour or lymph node
  ➡Abdominal examination
- Palpable abdominal renal mass
- Ballotable kidneys
- Scrotal swelling suggesting varicocele

810

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Anemia/ Erythrocytosis
- Thrombocytosis
  ➡ Urinalysis
  ➡Urine cytology
  ➡LFT
- Albumin for nutritional status
- Deranged liver function in liver metastasis or Stauffer syndrome
  ⇨ RFT
- Baseline renal function should be assessed since patients with preoperative renal dysfunction and those with risk of CKD should be offered partial instead of radical nephrectomy in order to preserve renal function
  ➡Serum LDH level
- May be prognostic in metastatic disease
  ➡Tissue diagnosis
- Nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy
  - Used in most cases to obtain tissue for diagnosis for renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
  - For patients with isolated solid renal masses resection with either a partial or complete nephrectomy is preferred to biopsy since it provides both diagnosis and definitive treatment
- Renal biopsy
  - Role of percutaneous biopsy is limited and preoperative needle biopsy is usually not used for resectable renal lesions because of low specificity and concern about tumour seedling of the peritoneum
  - Biopsy of a metastatic lesion is occasionally diagnostic and can be used for a small renal mass if there is high index of suspicion for a metastatic lesion to kidney since pathological confirmation is required prior to starting therapy (Biopsy of a metastatic site is often easier and more informative than biopsy of the primary tumour)

811

3. Radiological tests
   ➡ USG abdomen

- Less sensitive than CT in detecting a renal mass but is useful to distinguish a simple benign cyst from a more complex cyst or a solid tumour (cystic VS solid)
- Criteria that allows simple cyst to be differentiated from a tumour or abscess - Cyst is round and sharply demarcated with smooth walls - No echoes within the cyst (i.e. anechoic) - Strong posterior wall echo indicating good transmission through a cyst
  ➡CT abdomen and pelvis (CTU) with and without contrast
- Initial first imaging modality which is extremely accurate in staging RCC
  - 90% accurate in which the remaining inaccuracy is due to detection of oncocytoma which is a benign tumour
- Extent of local and regional involvement is determined primarily by abdominal CT
- Allows imaging of the renal parenchyma and collecting system
- CT findings of advanced malignancy\*
  - Central necrosis
  - Contrast enhancement
- Bosniak classification of cystic renal masses (by CT scan)

➡MRI abdomen and pelvis (MRU)

- Indicated when CT are non-diagnostic or radiographic contrast cannot be administered because of allergy or poor renal function
- Useful to identify presence or extent of involvement of collecting system or inferior vena cava (IVC)

[Image Description: The image shows the bottom right corner of a document page, the last three digits are 812]

➡CXR/CT thorax

- Evaluate for lung and mediastinal lymph node metastasis
- CT chest is warranted if metastatic disease is suspected from the CXR
  ➡ CT brain
- Evaluate for patients with neurological symptoms suspected of brain metastasis
  ➡Bone scan
- Indicated only in patients with bone pain or an elevated ALP
- Bone metastasis are frequently lytic rather than blastic and thus bone scan can be FN - Utilizes Tc to detect osteoblastic activity in bone with high turnover rate - Radionuclide bone scan is **NOT** indicated to look for osteolytic lesions since radionucleotide is taken up by osteoblast in order to show increased in uptake
  ➡PET-CT scan
- High sensitivity and specificity for primary metastasis
- Detects distant metastasis

VII. **Treatment**

1. **General approach**
   ➡Localized disease (Stage I, II and III)

- Partial nephrectomy either open or laparoscopic is indicated for small tumours especially in patients with bilateral and multiple lesions
- Radical nephrectomy is the most widely used approach when there is evidence of invasion into adrenal, renal vein or perinephric fat
- Ablative technique includes cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation are indicated in patients with significant comorbid disease
- **NO** role of adjuvant chemotherapy following complete resection of localized RCC
  ➡Advanced disease
- Radiotherapy
- Immunotherapy
- Targeted therapy
- Cytoreductive nephrectomy - Resection of tumour as much as possible to decrease tumour load to improve immunotherapy and targeted therapy
  [Image of the number 813]

2. Medical treatment
   ➡X Chemotherapy

- **NO** role in treatment of RCC due to low response rate and most response are short-lived
- Chemotherapeutic agents administered are easily excreted by kidneys
  ➡X Radiotherapy
- **ONLY** indicated for patients with brain or bone metastasis for palliation
  ➡Immunotherapy
- Interleukin-2 (IL-2) (High-dose)
  - Effective with long-term remissions without relapse
  - Associated high toxicity is often not tolerable
- IFN-α
  - Combined to cytoreductive nephrectomy which can improve survival
- Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)
  ➡Targeted therapy
- Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
  - **Example:** Sorafenib / Axitinib/ Sunitinib/ Pazopanib
- Anti-angiogenic (VEGF) agents
  - **Example:** Bevacizumab
- mTOR inhibitors
  - **Example:** Temsirolimus/ Everolimus/ Nivolumab/ Cabozantinib

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)/ Cryotherapy

- Indicated in patients with significant comorbidities that are not surgical candidates
- Oncological outcomes are inferior to surgery and associated with a high recurrence rate
- Maximal preservation of renal parenchyma and function
  ➡Partial nephrectomy
- Nephron-sparing surgery which preserve more renal function but associated with a higher recurrence rate
- Open _VS_ Laparoscopic _VS_ Robotic approach
  - Open approach is preferred in difficult cases such as solitary kidneys or tumour near the renal hilum
  - Laparoscopic approach is technically difficult unless robotic-assisted and has comparable outcomes with open approach
- Indications
  - Solitary kidney (**Absolute**)
  - Bilateral tumours (**Absolute**)
  - Multiple small tumours (**Absolute**)
  - Patients with comorbidities that already impaired renal function or will affect future renal function (e.g. DM) (with an intention to preserve renal function)
  - Primary tumour ≤7 cm (T1 stage) (**Elective**)

[Image: A small number "814" is at the bottom right of the page.]

➡Radical nephrectomy

- Open VS Laparoscopic VS Robotic approach
  - Laparoscopic approach is the standard approach nowadays
- Involves ligation of renal artery and vein, removal of kidney and Gerota's fascia ± Ipsilateral adrenal gland + Regional lymph nodes
  - Early ligation of vascular pedicle is important to prevent tumour dissemination and once artery is occluded the tumour lost most of its profuse blood supply and massive bleeding during mobilization becomes less likely
  - Thrombectomy can also be performed when there is cavoatrial tumour involvement meaning thrombus involving IVC and right atrium (RA)
- Anterior transabdominal (Transperitoneal) VS Retroperitoneal approach

| Approach                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Anterior transabdominal (Transperitoneal) | ➡Ability to remove tumour through a relatively small incision ➡ More spacious operative field Easier mobilization of the renal hilum Easier dissection of Gerota's fascia Renal pedicle and IVC can be widely exposed |
| Retroperitoneal approach                  | ➡Indicated in patients with Multiple unresolved abdominal scars Adhesions due to previous abdominal surgery Peritoneal dialysis (PD)                                                                                  |

- Indications
  - Primary tumour > 7 cm (T2 stage)
  - Renal vein or IVC thrombus (T3 stage)
  - Direct extension into ipsilateral adrenal gland (T4 stage)
  - Suspected lymph node involvement
  - Tumour involving a more central position of the kidney
- Complications

| :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| General  | ➡General anesthetic risk Respi: Aspiration pneumonia/ Atelectasis/ Pulmonary embolism/ Pneumothorax CVS: Hypotension/ Cardiac arrhythmia/ AMI                          |
|          | ➡Bleeding ➡Superficial or deep wound infections ➡Paralytic ileus Especially for transperitoneal approach Ileus is not common when peritoneal cavity is not entered     |

[Image Description: The image contains a table comparing Anterior transabdominal and Retroperitoneal approaches for radical nephrectomy. It details the advantages and indications for each approach. The table is followed by lists of indications and complications associated with the procedure. The "Types" table has two categories "General" and "Specific" listing potential complications. The complications include general anesthesia risk, respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, bleeding, wound infections, paralytic ileus, injury to adjacent organs, and temporary or permanent renal failure.]

# Nephrology Diseases

## Urothelial bladder cancer

I. **Overview**

1. General features
   ➡ Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy involving the urinary system
   ➡ Urothelial cell (previous known as transitional cell) carcinoma (UCC) is the predominant
   histological subtype accounting for approximately 90% of bladder cancers
   - SCC (5%) and adenocarcinoma (2%) are rarer
     ➡ Classification
   - Classification by depth of invasion or metastasis includes non-muscle invasive
     (superficial), muscle invasive and metastatic disease
     - Non-muscle invasive (superficial) = Ta, Tis, T1
     - Muscle invasive = T2 or above
   - Classification by differentiation includes low-grade or high-grade tumour based upon the
     degree of nuclear anaplasia and architectural abnormalities - Muscle invasive tumours (T2 or above) are mostly high-grade tumours
     ➡ Field cancerization concept
   - Multifocal occurrence is a characteristic and notorious feature of urothelial carcinoma of
     both urinary bladder and upper urinary tract
   - Spreads through urothelium via intraluminal seeding or intraepithelial migration
     ➡ Common sites of metastasis
   - Liver
   - Lung
   - Bone

II. **Epidemiology**

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ Male predominance (M:F = 3:1)
   - Second most prevalent malignancy after prostate cancer in middle-aged males
     ➡ Median age of diagnosis = 70 years old
   - Presence of otherwise unexplained hematuria indicates urothelial cancer in individuals
     over age 40 until proven otherwise
     [Image: the number 816 at the bottom right of the page]

III. Etiology

1. Risk factors for UCC
   ➡ Medical history

- Chronic cystitis
- Upper urinary tract cancer
  - Urothelial cancer of renal pelvis and ureter are thought to be due to same etiological factors as urothelial cancer of bladder
  - Drop metastasis meaning urothelial cancer can spread to urothelial structures either proximal or distal to the primary tumour
  - Patients with CA renal pelvis or ureter have a 17% chance of having a concurrent CA bladder
  - Patients with CA bladder only has 2% chance to have an upper tract cancer due to antegrade flow of urine
    ➡ Drug history
- Cyclophosphamide
  - Increases risk of both hemorrhagic cystitis and urothelial cancer
- Radiation therapy
  - Pelvic irradiation for rectal, cervical, prostate and testicular cancer
    ➡ Social history
- Smoking
  - **MOST** important factor contributing to bladder cancer
- Occupational chemical exposure
  - Exposure to paints, hair dyes, textile dyes, rubber, solvents and diesel exhaust
  - Occupations of increased risk include metal workers, painters, rubber industry workers, leather workers, textile and electrical workers, miners, cement workers, transport operators and excavating-machine operators

2. Risk factors for SCC
   ➡ Bladder stones
   ➡ Parasitic infections (Schistosomiasis)
   ➡ Long-term indwelling catheters

- Patients with spinal cord injuries who have long-term indwelling catheters have a 16 – 20x risk of developing SCC in the bladder (**NOT** UCC because of chronic irritation by catheter in bladder)

3. Risk factors for adenocarcinoma
   ➡ Urachal remnants
   ➡ Bladder exstrophy

IV. Pathogenesis

1. WHO histological grading

PUNLMP Low grade High grade 2004 WHO

Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 1973 WHO

[Image Description: A horizontal gradient bar ranging from light gray to dark gray. Above the bar, labels "Grade 1," "Grade 2," and "Grade 3" are positioned above specific points along the gradient, indicating increasing severity. Two gray horizontal lines run above the gradient bar, with labels "PUNLMP," "Low Grade," and "High Grade" indicating the different levels of grading along the lines. To the right of the upper and lower horizontal lines are labels "2004 WHO" and "1973 WHO" respectively.]

Histologic Spectrum of transitional cell carcinoma (urothelial carcinoma [UC])
➡ Histological grading

- 1973 WHO grading
  - Grade 1 = Well-differentiated
  - Grade 2 = Moderately differentiated
  - Grade 3 = Poorly differentiated
- 2004 WHO grading (papillary lesion)
  - Urothelial papilloma (completely benign lesion)
  - Papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP)
  - Low grade (LG) papillary urothelial carcinoma
  - High grade (HG) papillary urothelial carcinoma

818

2. TNM staging or urothelial cancer (2017)
   ➡ Staging system
   - Clinical staging
     - Based on information derived from bimanual examination, imaging study and
       pathological result from cystoscopic biopsy or TURBT
   - Pathological staging
     - Pathological staging is based on specimen from cystectomy and pelvic

Remarks: Carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) is by definition high-grade intraepithelial neoplasm without invasion
into subepithelial connective tissue

V. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Hematuria

- Typically gross, intermittent, painless and present throughout micturition
- Painless gross hematuria in adult should be regarded as a symptom of malignancy until proven otherwise and demand immediate urological examination
  - Most common cause of gross hematuria in patient ≥ 50 is CA bladder
- Suspect CA bladder in patients present with unexplained microscopic hematuria
  ➡Abdominal pain
- Result of locally advanced tumour
  - Flank pain suggests tumour obstructing ureter at any level
- Suprapubic pain suggests tumour invading perivesical soft tissues and nerves
- Hypogastric, rectal or perineal pain suggests tumour invading obturator fossa, perirectal fat, presacral nerves or urogenital diaphragm
  ➡Voiding symptoms
- Most common in patients with carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) of bladder
- Result from functional decrease in bladder capacity, detrusor overactivity, invasion of trigone or obstruction of bladder neck or urethra
- Irritative voiding symptoms
  - Frequency
  - Urgency
  - Dysuria
- Obstructive voiding symptoms
  - Nocturia
  - Straining
  - Intermittent and weak stream
  - Incomplete voiding
    ➡LL edema
- Compression of iliac vessels

2. Signs and symptoms of metastasis
   ➡ Bone pain

- Suggests presence of bone metastasis
  ➡RUQ pain and jaundice
- Suggests presence of liver metastasis
  ➡Headache or disordered cognitive function
- Suggests presence of intracranial or leptomeningeal metastasis

3. Constitutional symptoms
   ➡ Fatigue
   ➡ Anorexia and weight loss

VI. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡Abdominal examination

- Pelvic mass or nodularity in periumbilical region
- Para-aortic lymph node
- Hepatomegaly
  - Suggests liver metastasis
    820

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials
   ⇨ LFT
   ⇨ RFT
   _ Metastatic workup
   ➡ Urine cytology
   _ Cells in the urinary tract that are proliferating rapidly will be exfoliated
   _ Low sensitivity in particular for low-grade tumours
   _ **High** specificity and thus any positive cytology should be assumed malignancy (either urothelial malignancy or carcinoma-in-situ)
   ➡ Urinalysis \* Look for evidence of glomerular bleeding including red cell casts, dysmorphic red cells particularly acanthocytes and proteinuria

3. Radiological tests
   ➡ Cystourethroscopy + Biopsy
   _ **GOLD STANDARD** for initial diagnosis and staging of bladder cancer
   _ Any visible tumour or suspicious lesion should be either biopsied or resected transurethrally (TURBT) to determine the histology and depth of invasion
   _ Biopsy alone may not be able to determine extent of muscle invasiveness
   _ **Low**-grade non-invasive tumour appears as papillary with a narrow stalk
   _ **High**-grade invasive tumour appears as sessile, solid or nodular
   _ Carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) appears as flat velvety lesion and can arise in patches
   ➡ Renal USG
   _ Confirm the presence of a soft tissue mass
   _ Evaluate for renal parenchymal disease and hydronephrosis
   _ **CANNOT** determine depth of invasion, extravesical extension or nodal status
   ➡ CT urography (CTU)
   _ CT should include **BOTH** abdomen and pelvis and **BOTH** with and without contrast
   _ Demonstrate extravesical extension, LN involvement in pelvis or retroperitoneum, metastasis to lung and bone and tumour involvement or obstruction of upper urinary tract
   _ Miss small tumours < 1 cm in size particularly those in bladder trigone or dome and cannot differentiate depth of bladder wall invasion
   ➡ MR urography (MRU)
   _ Indicated in patients with allergy to iodinated contrast
   _ Cannot be used in claustrophobic patients or patients with pacemakers or other metallic foreign bodies
   ➡ Retrograde pyelogram
   _ Used to diagnose urinary tract obstruction but largely supplanted by USG and CTU
   _ Indicated in patients with insufficient renal function to excrete IV contrast
   _ Classical urographic findings of an upper tract TCC is a meniscus-shaped ureteral filling defect known as "Goblet" sign produced by contrast being trapped in the fronds of a papillary tumour
   ➡ Other imaging modalities for metastasis
   _ CXR for lung metastasis
   _ Radionuclide bone scan for bone metastasis
   _ PET-CT scan for metastasis

VII. Treatment

1. Risk stratification
   Non-muscle invasive disease (Ta, Tis, T1)
   Risk of progression is stratified as low, intermediate and high based upon tumour grade,
   tumour size, invasion into lamina propria and whether tumour is recurrent and multifocal

| Group        | Description                                                                                               | Risk of progression | Recommended treatment                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low          | ➡Solitary, low-grade Ta tumour < 3 cm in diameter, with no CIS                                            | 0 – 4%              | ➡ TURBT +<br>➡ One immediate instillation of intravesical chemotherapy perioperatively                                                                  |
| Intermediate | ➡ All tumours not meeting criteria for low risk or high risk                                              | 10 – 15%            | ➡ TURBT +<br>➡ One immediate instillation of intravesical chemotherapy perioperatively<br>➡ Intravesical immunotherapy (BCG) or chemotherapy for 1 year |
| **High**     | ➡ T1 tumours (OR)<br>➡ HG/G3 tumours (OR)<br>➡ CIS (OR)<br>➡ Multiple large tumour > 3cm Ta G1/G2 tumours | 30 – 40%            | ⇨ TURBT +<br>One immediate instillation of intravesical chemotherapy perioperatively<br>➡Intravesical immunotherapy (BCG) for 3 years<br>➡Cystectomy    |

2. Treatment for non-muscle invasive disease (Ta, Tis, T1)
   ➡Transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT)

- Initial treatment of non-muscle invasive tumours is a complete TURBT
- Allows staging of tumour to provide an initial assessment of the depth of invasion
  ➡Intravesical therapy
- Significance: Risk of recurrence and progression
- Intravesical therapy is typically started 2 – 6 weeks after TURBT to allow healing of mucosa damage after surgery to reduce local or systemic toxicities
- Induction therapy
  - Administered weekly for 6 weeks
  - Facilitate delivery of high local concentrations of therapeutic agents within bladder to destroy viable tumour cells that remain following TURBT and preventing tumour implantation
- Maintenance therapy
  - Administered weekly for 3 weeks at 3, 6, 12 months (intermediate-risk)
  - Administered weekly for 3 weeks at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months (high-risk)
- Intravesical chemotherapy with mitomycin C
  - Mitomycin C is an alkylating agent (direct cytotoxicity)
  - One immediate postoperative instillation is proven to decrease recurrence
  - Complications include chemical cystitis and rash
- Intravesical immunotherapy with BCG
  - BCG = Bacillus Calmette Guerin which is a live attenuated form of M. bovis
  - Acts by triggering non-specific cytokine-mediated local immune response
  - Localized complications: Cystitis/ Prostatitis/ Epididymoorchitis
  - Systemic complications: BCG sepsis/ Pneumonitis/ Hepatitis/ Arthritis

3. Treatment for muscle invasive disease (T2 or above)
   ➡Radical cystectomy + Urinary diversion

- Can be performed in open or laparoscopic approach with or without robotic assistance
- Role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  - Patients receiving platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy has a statistically significant survival advantage
- Includes removal of bladder, adjacent organs and regional lymph nodes
  - **Males**: Includes prostate and seminal vesicles
  - **Females**: Includes ovaries, uterus, cervix and anterior vagina (Anterior exenteration)
- Lymph node dissection
  - ALL patients should undergo bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy including external and internal iliac nodes and obturator nodes
- Complications - Urine leak (from ureteroileal anastomosis) - Common cause of prolonged ileus, intraabdominal urinoma, abscess formation and wound dehiscence - Intestinal anastomotic leak - Prolonged ileus/ Intestinal obstruction - Rectal injury - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/ Pulmonary embolism (PE) - Common after cystectomy due to advanced age of most patients, presence of malignancy and proximity of iliac veins to resection and LN dissection

[Diagram of the urinary system with a diversion. The diagram shows a female body with the bladder removed. In one image, the ureters are connected to a segment of small intestine, which is then brought to the skin as a stoma. In the other image, the ureters are connected to a pouch made from small intestine, which is then connected to the urethra.]

- Types of urinary diversion
  - Common metabolic deranges with use of intestine include metabolic acidosis, vitamin B12 deficiency and bone loss

➡ Radiotherapy

- Can be given in external beam irradiation or brachytherapy
- Inferior to surgery and hence is only indicated in patients with muscle-invasive diseases who are not surgical candidate

824

4. Treatment of metastatic disease
   ➡Chemotherapy

- Platinum-based chemotherapy is the preferred initial approach for systemic therapy in patients with metastatic disease
- Urothelial bladder cancer is most sensitive to cisplatin-based chemotherapy
  ➡Immunotherapy
- Utilization of checkpoint inhibition agents leads to advancement in treatment of non- small cell lung carcinoma and melanoma

VIII. Complication

1. Complications of urothelial cancer
   ➡ Hydronephrosis and hydroureter

- Invasive bladder tumours can cause distal ureteral obstruction and secondary hydronephrosis

IX. Prevention

1. Surveillance
   ➡Careful follow-up is required for all patients with bladder cancer

- Secondary primary tumours can develop in urothelium anywhere along the urinary tract including the renal pelvis, ureter, urethra and bladder
- Surveillance includes a careful program of cystoscopy and urine cytology beginning 3 months after initial treatment

# Nephrology Diseases

## Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)

I. Overview

1. General features
   - ➡BPH is a common disorder that increases in prevalence with age
     - BPH is a histological diagnosis
     - Does **NOT** predispose to prostate cancer
2. Anatomy of prostate

[Anatomical drawing of the male prostate. On the left is a clear drawing of the prostate highlighting the Transitional zone, Anterior region (nonglandular), Area of seminal colliculus, External urethral sphincter, Penile urethra, Ampulla of ductus deferens, Seminal vesicle, Ejaculatory duct, Peripheral zone and Central zone. On the right is a cross-sectional side view drawing of the male prostate, highlighting the bladder neck, Median lobe, Ejaculatory ducts, Posterior lobe, External urethral sphincter, and Anterior lobe.]

- ➡Characteristics
  - **Normal size**: < 2 finger breaths
  - **Normal volume**: < 25 cm³
  - Anterior to rectum, posterior to pubic symphysis and inferior to bladder
  - Ejaculatory duct passes through the posterior aspect of the prostate and opens into prostatic urethra
  - Testosterone is converted into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the gland by 5a-reductase
  - Prostate epithelial cells and stromal cells express androgen receptors and depend on androgen (i.e. DHT) for growth
- ➡Divisions of prostate

| Region            | Characteristics                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Anterior zone     | ➡ Fibromuscular region                                                                          |
| Central zone      | ➡Surround ejaculatory duct                                                                      |
| Periurethral zone | ➡ Surrounds prostatic urethra                                                                   |
| Transitional zone | ➡Common site of BPH (**Median lobe**)                                                           |
|                   | BPH is more symptomatic since it is located in the middle                                       |
| Peripheral zone   | ➡ Common site of prostate cancer and inflammation (**Posterior lobe**)                          |
|                   | Prostate cancer usually presents late with symptoms since it is located at the posterior aspect |

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ 50% of patients at age 50 have lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to BPH

III. Etiology

1. Risk factors
   ➡ Aging

2. Differential diagnosis of LUTS
   ➡ Bladder outlet obstruction typically presents with predominantly voiding symptoms
   ➡ Overactive bladder typically presents with predominantly storage symptoms

IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Dysuria

- Result of urinary infection from obstruction or stasis or by inflammation of the distended urethral mucosa
  ➡ Hematuria
- Gross or microscopic hematuria (bleeding BPH)
- Presence of BPH should not dissuade from further evaluation of hematuria since older men are also at risk of other genitourinary disorders
  ➡ Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) (Mnemonics: FUN DISH)

| Lower urinrary tract symptoms                           |                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Storage (irritative) symptoms                           | Voiding (obstructive) symptoms (predominant)                                                                                             |

# V. Diagnosis

1. History taking

➡ History of presenting illness (HPI)

- Hematuria
- Abdominal or back pain
- Storage/ Voiding/ Irritative symptoms
- American Urologic Association/ International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)\*
  - Assessment of symptoms severity in a quantitative way
  - Incomplete emptying/ Urinary frequency/ Dribbling/ Urgency/ Weak stream/ Hesitance/Nocturia

[Image Description: This is a table in two rows and eight columns. The first row represents a form for patient information, including fields for Name and Date. The second row is the header row that describes the frequency in which symptoms are experienced with these titles from left to right: None, Less than once in five times, Less than half the time, About half the time, More than half the time, Almost Always. There is a column containing score values from zero to five at the top of each column respectively.]

[Image Description: This is a table with 7 rows and 7 columns. The first column lists different urinary symptoms, while the remaining columns quantify the frequency of these symptoms. The first column starts with a number and a title of the symptom, followed by a descriptive sentence. The column titles are: None (0), Less than once in five times (1), Less than half the time (2), About half the time (3), More than half the time (4), Almost Always (5). The rows of the table are: 1. Incomplete emptying, "Over the past month, have you had a sensation of not emptying your bladder completely?", 2. Frequency, "Over the past month, have you had to urinate again less than two hours after you finished urinating?", 3. Intermittency, "Over the past month, have you found you stopped and started again several times when you urinated?", 4. Urgency, "Over the past month, have you found it difficult to postpone urination?", 5. Weak stream, "Over the past month, have you had a weak urinary stream?", and 6. Straining, "Over the past month, have you had to push or strain to begin urination?". ]

[Image Description: This is a table in three rows and seven columns. The first column contains score values from zero to six, while the remaining columns describe the quality of life associated with those scores. The column titles from left to right: Very satisfied, Satisfied, More or less satisfied, About equally satisfied and dissatisfied, More or less dissatisfied, Dissatisfied, Very dissatisfied. The first row is titled: 7. Nocturia, "Over the past month, how many times did you typically get up to urinate from the time you went to bed at night until the time you got up in the morning?", with score values of zero through five. The second row is titled: IPSS Overall Score, followed by the sentence: "Total score: 0-7 indicates mild symptoms, 8-19 indicates moderate symptoms, 20-35 indicates severe symptoms". The third row is titled: "How would you feel about your quality of life for the rest of your life if you continue to experience your urinary condition?", with score values of zero through six.]

➡ Medical history

- Urinary tract infection (UTI)
- Sexually transmitted disease (STD)
- Neurogenic diseases

➡ Surgical history

- Radical prostatectomy
- Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)
- Urinary instrumentation

➡ Drug history

- Sympathomimetic increases outflow resistance
  - α-adrenergic agents: Phenylephrine (decongestant)
  - β-adrenergic agents: Terbutaline (asthma) / Isoproterenol
- Anticholinergics (anti-muscarinic/ anti-nicotinic) impairs bladder contractility
  - Promethazine (1st gen: allergic rhinitis)/ Loratadine (2nd gen: allergic rhinitis)
  - Ipratropium/ Tiotropium (asthma)

➡ Social history

- Smoking
- Sexual history

2. Physical examination

➡ Abdominal examination

- Distended bladder

➡ Digital rectal examination (DRE)

- Prostate size, consistency, surface nodularity, presence of median groove and tenderness
- Anal sphincter tone and presence of perineal sensation
  - Suggests underlying neurological causes and focused neurological examination should be considered

829

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials
   ⇨ RFT

- High serum creatinine level can result from bladder outlet obstruction or underlying renal disease which should prompt an USG
  ➡ Urinalysis
- Detect presence of blood, bacteria and WBC
- Urine smear and culture with sensitivity testing to exclude UTI
  ➡Urine cytology
- Indicated if bladder cancer is suspected in patients presenting with hematuria and predominantly irritative symptoms
  ➡Serum PSA level (t1/2 = 2 - 3 days)
- Prostate-specific but **NOT** prostate-cancer specific
- PSA level predicts the prostate volume and risk for BPH progression
  - PSA > 1.5 ng/mL is a useful marker for prostatic enlargement and predicts an increased risk of BPH progression
- Level of PSA is strongly associated with risk and outcome of prostate cancer
- Do **NOT** screen if patients have < 10 years of life expectancy unless they have clinically obvious diseases such as a palpable nodule on DRE
- ↑ Serum PSA level
  - Prostatitis
  - Benign prostatic hyperplasia
  - Prostate cancer
  - Prostate biopsy
- Interpretation of serum PSA level - PSA < 4 ng/mL = Normal - **PSA ≥ 4 ng/mL** = Cutoff for diagnostic prostate biopsy - PSA 4-10 ng/mL = 20% chance of cancer - **PSA ≥ 10 ng/mL** = 50% chance of cancer
  ➡Prostate biopsy
- Definitive diagnosis is established by an image-guided needle biopsy with direct visualization by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) or MRI
  - Transrectal biopsy is associated with a risk of sepsis
  - -ve Biopsy result does not exclude prostate cancer and repeated biopsy may be indicated if PSA level increases further
- Indications for prostate biopsy **PROVIDED** patients have > 10 years of life expectancy
  - Elevated PSA level in repeated (2nd) measurement
  - Abnormal DRE (Palpable nodule in prostate)
  - Clinical metastatic disease for diagnosis

4. Radiological tests
   ➡ USG kidney and bladder

- Non-invasive test that can demonstrate the size and shape of kidneys, presence of duplication and dilatation of ureters and existence of gross abnormalities
- Identify stone and exclude complications of obstruction such as hydroureter and hydronephrosis
  ➡ Urethrocystoscopy
- Indicated in patients with suspected urethral stricture, bladder calculi and cancer
  ➡ Urodynamic study (Flow rate study)
- Should have passed > 150 mL of urine and residual urine normally < 50 mL
- Qmax < 10 mL/s is more likely to benefit from surgery
- Post-void residual (PVR)
  - Indicated in patients with urinary retention
  - PVR > 200 mL indicates obstruction

VI. Treatment

1. Non-pharmacological approach
   ➡ Foley catheterization

- Indicated in patients in AROU
- Monitor first catheterization volume and Q1H for urine output
- Urine should be sent for smear and culture with sensitivity testing
- Placed for 2 days and undergo a trial without catheter (TWOC)
- Look for complications of decompression such as post-obstructive diuresis
  - Defined as diuresis > 200 mL/hr for 2 hours
  - Refers to diuresis that persists after decompression of the bladder as body attempts to excrete excess fluid retained during the period of obstruction
  - Primarily a problem of chronic but not acute urinary retention
  - Do **NOT** remove Foley catheter since it may lead to hydronephrosis
  - Patients normally can manage the increase in urine output by increasing oral fluid intake but fluid replacement is required in patient who are unable to do so
    ➡ Medical advice
- Avoid fluids prior to bedtime or before going out
- Reduce consumption of caffeine and alcohol
- Double voiding to empty bladder more completely

2. Medical treatment
   ➡ Treatment choices

- α1-adrenergic antagonist monotherapy is the initial treatment of choice
  - Start α-blocker for immediate symptom relief and FU in 1 – 3 months
- Combination therapy (α1-adrenergic antagonist + 5α-reductase inhibitor) for patient with severe symptoms of BPH and has inadequate response with monotherapy
- Combination therapy (α1-adrenergic antagonist + anti-cholinergics) for patients presenting with **BOTH** storage and voiding symptoms
- Desmopressin may be used to treat nocturia

Remarks: ß₃-adrenergic agonist (e.g. Mirabegron) is now available and effective for treating LUTS related to overactive bladder. It acts by activating ß₃-adrenergic receptors resulting in relaxation of detrusor smooth muscle during urine storage phase. It is effective as other anticholinergics in reducing frequency, urgency and incontinence and does not have the same concern for urinary retention as do the anticholinergic medications.

3. Surgical treatment (Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP))
   ➡General features

- TURP decreases urinary symptom score (IPSS), decreases PVR and increases maximal urinary flow rate
  ➡Indications
- Recurrent acute retention of urine (AROU)
  - Failed a voiding trial without catheter (TWOC)
- Recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI)
- Recurrent hematuria
- Renal insufficiency secondary to BPH
- Bordering LUTS refractory or cannot tolerate medical treatment
  ➡Pre-operative preparation
- Antibiotic prophylaxis - Recommended for procedures that manipulate genitourinary tract
  ➡Surgical procedure
- Monopolar TURP(經 patient 身體 earth 落地下)
  - Resectoscope loaded with monopolar diathermy loop is introduced into bladder
  - Continuous irrigation using non-conductive solution containing glycine is used to distend the bladder and wash away blood and prostate tissue fragments
    - Glycine is better than distilled water as non-conductive irrigant since it causes less TUR syndrome comparatively
    - Saline solution **CANNOT** be used for monopolar resection because it is a good conductor of electricity, diffuses power and does not allow cutting or cauterization of tissue
  - Strips of prostate tissue are resected under direct vision and placed temporarily into the bladder until entire region of hyperplasia is resected
  - Prostate chips are evacuated from bladder and bleeding is controlled using electrocautery
- Bipolar TURP - Saline is used as the irrigant in bipolar which eliminates the risk of hyponatremia in TUR syndrome (post-prostatectomy syndrome) - More expensive than monopolar TURP
  ➡Complications
- Bleeding (Hematuria)
  - Secondary to trauma or infection (prostatitis)
  - Bleeding requiring blood transfusion (1%)
- Urethral stricture
- Urinary incontinence
- Sexual dysfunction
  - Erectile dysfunction
  - Retrograde ejaculation
- TUR syndrome\* (Post-prostatectomy syndrome) - Hyponatremia due to systemic absorption of hypotonic irrigating fluid used in monopolar TURP procedure - Characterized by fluid overload, dilutional hyponatremia and glycine toxicity - Severe cases with mental status change and pulmonary edema should be managed with diuresis with hypertonic saline for Na+ supplementation - Prevented by using bipolar technique which uses NS which is isotonic and thus not associated with hyponatremia and decrease time of procedure
  [Image of the number 833 at the bottom right of the page.]

- Post-operative management
  - Avoid straining and stool softeners are prescribed
    - Increased vulnerability to bleeding until prostatic fossa is completely epithelialized

4. Other surgical treatment (Laser technique)

- Holmium laser enucleation of prostate (HoLEP)
  - HOLEP uses the laser like a knife to enucleate the BPH adenoma
  - Normal saline is usually used as the irrigation solution
  - **Advantage:** Decrease blood loss (preferred in patients on anticoagulants)/ Less TUR syndrome (NS can be used because there is no monopolar electrocautery)
  - **Disadvantage:** Technically more challenging to perform than PVP
- Photoselective vaporization (PVP) (Greenlight laser)
  - PVP uses the laser to vaporize the prostate tissue
  - Normal saline is usually used as the irrigation solution
  - Based upon the concept of photothermolysis (i.e. selective thermal confinement of light-induced damage)
  - Can be performed under local or regional anesthesia as an outpatient procedure
  - **Advantage:** Decrease blood loss (preferred in patients on anticoagulants)/ Less TUR syndrome (NS can be used because there is no monopolar electrocautery)
  - **Disadvantage:** Takes more time than TURP to perform and less prostatic tissues are removed

5. Other surgical treatment (Minimally invasive ablative technique)

- Transurethral/ Transrectal microwave thermotherapy (TUMT/ TRMT)
  - Involves heating prostatic tissues to temperature > 45°C
  - Microwave delivery catheter is passed per urethra and located in prostatic urethra by inflation of the catheter balloon
  - Rectal temperature is monitored by means of a device inserted into rectum

VII. Complication

1. Complications of BPH

- Acute retention of urine (AROU)
- Hydroureter and hydronephrosis
- Bladder stones
- Recurrent UTI
- Renal failure

# Nephrology Diseases

# Prostate cancer

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ > 95% of prostate cancer are adenocarcinoma
   ➡ Metastatic prostate cancer can be result of direct extension from colon cancer of transitional cell
   tumour of the urinary bladder
   ➡ Mode of spread (most common site of metastasis is pelvic LNs and bone)

- Direct spread = Bladder/ Seminal vesicles
- Lymphatic spread = Pelvic and paraaortic LNs
- Hematogenous spread = Prostatic venous plexus to vertebral venous plexus

2. Anatomy of prostate

[Anterior view of the prostate and seminal vesicles in a person. The prostate is a pear-shaped gland located below the bladder. The urethra passes through the prostate. On either side of the prostate are the seminal vesicles, which are responsible for producing fluid that nourishes and protects sperm. Parts of the figure are labelled "Urethra", "Transitional zone", "Anterior region (nonglandular)", "Area of seminal colliculus", "External urethral sphincter", "Penile urethra", "Ampulla of ductus deferens", "Seminal vesicle", "Ejaculatory duct", "Peripheral zone", and "Central zone".]

[A side view illustration of the prostate gland and bladder, showing the different lobes of the prostate. The bladder neck connects the bladder to the urethra. The median lobe is a small lobe located in the middle of the prostate. The ejaculatory ducts pass through the posterior lobe, which is located at the back of the prostate. The external urethral sphincter is a muscle that controls the flow of urine. The anterior lobe is located at the front of the prostate. Parts of the figure are labelled "Bladder neck", "Median lobe", "Ejaculatory ducts", "Posterior lobe", "External urethral sphincter", and "Anterior lobe".]

➡ Characteristics

- Normal size: < 2 finger breaths
- Normal volume: < 25 cm³
- Anterior to rectum, posterior to pubic symphysis and inferior to bladder
- Ejaculatory duct passes through the posterior aspect of the prostate and opens into prostatic urethra
- Testosterone is converted into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the gland by 5a-reductase
- Prostate epithelial cells and stromal cells express androgen receptors and depend on androgen (i.e. DHT) for growth

| Transitional zone | Common site of BPH (Median lobe) BPH is more symptomatic since it is located in the middle                                                                         |
| Peripheral zone   | ➡ Common site of prostate cancer and inflammation (Posterior lobe) Prostate cancer usually presents late with symptoms since it is located at the posterior aspect |

IV. **Pathogenesis**

1. Gleason score
   ➡ Background

- Commonly used system for classifying histologic characteristics of prostate cancer
- Predominant pattern and second-most common pattern are each given a grade (1 – 5)
- Gleason score is the sum of these 2 grades (Range: 2 – 10) (8 – 10 considered high)
  ➡ Grading of histological patterns

[Image: A diagram titled "Gleason's Pattern" showing the progression of prostate cancer grades. The diagram is vertically oriented with five horizontal bands, each representing a different grade, each represented by histological depictions. The grades are:

1. Small, uniform glands. The corresponding image shows well-defined, rounded glands closely packed together. A label says "Well differentiated" with an arrow pointing towards this grade.
2. More stroma between glands. The corresponding image shows glands that are slightly less uniform and more spaced out with more stroma in between.A label says "Moderately differentiated" with an arrow pointing towards this grade.
3. Distinctly infiltrative margins. The corresponding image shows glands with irregular shapes and infiltrating margins.
4. Irregular masses of neoplastic glands. The corresponding image shows disorganized, irregular masses of cells.
5. Only occasional gland formation. The corresponding image shows only a few glands, almost completely undifferentiated cells. A label says "Poorly differentiated/Anaplastic" with an arrow pointing towards this grade.
   Below the diagram are three microscopic images, each labeled with a grade. From left to right, they are:
   Grade 3: Shows irregular glands with some infiltrating margins.
   Grade 4: Shows more disorganized tissue with fewer distinct glands.
   Grade 5: Shows sheets of undifferentiated cells with almost no recognizable glands.

| Grade | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | ➡ Well-differentiated carcinoma ➡ Glands are small, well-formed and closely packed                                                                       |
| 2     | ➡ Moderately differentiated carcinoma ➡ Glands are larger, well-formed but with increased stroma separating glands                                       |
| 3     | ➡ Moderately differentiated carcinoma ➡ Glands are still recognizable but darker ➡ Infiltrative pattern - Cells begin to invade surrounding tissues      |
| 4     | ➡ Poorly differentiated carcinoma ➡ Few recognizable glands ➡ Infiltrative pattern - Many cells are invading the surrounding tissue in neoplastic masses |
| 5     | ➡ Anaplastic carcinoma ➡ No recognizable glands ➡ Sheets of cells throughout surrounding tissues                                                         |

Remarks: Differentiation is the degree in which the neoplasm resembles the native tissue. So less differentiation (less resemblance) typically has a worse prognosis

2. TNM staging (American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) & Union for International Cancer
   Control (UICC) 2017)
   ➡Clinical staging

- Patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer are assigned a clinical prognostic stage
  group based upon DRE, imaging studies and prostate biopsy findings
  ➡Pathological staging
- Patients who subsequently undergo a radical prostatectomy are assigned a pathologic
  stage group based upon the histological examination of surgical resection specimen
- Patients who do not undergo prostatectomy are NOT assigned a pathological stage and
  treatment decision are based upon the clinical stage

V. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Anemia
   ➡ Hematuria and hematospermia

VI. **Diagnosis**

1. Physical examination
   ➡ Digital rectal examination (DRE)
   - Hard, nodular and irregular prostate with loss of median sulcus
   - Asymmetrical induration or frank nodules are consistent with CA prostate
   - Symmetrical enlargement and firmness are consistent with BPH

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials - Anemia
   ➡ Serum Ca2+ level - Evaluate for bone metastasis
   ➡ LFT - Serum ALP level to evaluate for bone metastasis
   ⇨ RFT
   ➡ Urinalysis - Evaluation for hematuria
   ➡ Serum PSA level - Prostate-specific but **NOT** prostate-cancer specific - Level of PSA is strongly associated with risk and outcome of prostate cancer - Do **NOT** screen if patients have < 10 years of life expectancy unless they have clinically obvious diseases such as a palpable nodule on DRE - ↑ Serum PSA level - Prostatitis - Benign prostatic hyperplasia - Prostate cancer - Prostate biopsy - Interpretation of serum PSA level - PSA < 4 ng/mL = Normal - **PSA ≥ 4 ng/mL** = Cutoff for diagnostic prostate biopsy - PSA 4 – 10 ng/mL = 20% chance of cancer - **PSA ≥ 10 ng/mL** = 50% chance of cancer
   ➡ Prostate biopsy - Definitive diagnosis is established by an image-guided needle biopsy with direct visualization by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) or MRI - Transrectal biopsy is associated with a risk of sepsis and antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered - -ve Biopsy result does not exclude prostate cancer and repeated biopsy may be indicated if PSA level increases further - Indications for prostate biopsy **PROVIDED** patients have > 10 years of life expectancy - Elevated PSA level in repeated (2nd) measurement - Abnormal DRE (Palpable nodule in prostate) - Clinical metastatic disease for diagnosis - Histological aggressive is assigned using Gleason grading system - Staging of the cancer by TMN system
   [Image: The number 840 is at the bottom right corner of the page.]

3. Radiological tests
   ➡X-ray pelvis and lumbar spine

- Investigation of back pain
- Presence of osteosclerotic metastasis in prostate cancer - Bone metastasis in CA prostate is predominantly **OSTEOBLASTIC** - In contrast to multiple myeloma which is purely osteolytic - In contrast to breast cancer which is mixed osteolytic and osteoblastic with predominant osteolytic lesions
  ➡Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)/ Transperineal biopsy
- Frequently use to direct prostate biopsy instead of staging of primary tumour
- **NO** TRUS finding consistently indicates cancer with certainty and **NOT** used for staging of prostate cancer
  - Low sensitivity and specificity
  - Cancer can be hyperechoic, isoechoic or hypoechoic
  - Ant abnormalities detected should be disregarded since benign and malignant pathology is absolutely the same
- Complications of TRUS biopsy
  - AROU due to pain and swelling of prostate
  - Bleeding (Hematuria/ Hematospermia/ PR bleeding)
  - Prostatitis and prostatic abscess
  - Urosepsis
- Transperineal approach is an alternative for patients who cannot undergo transrectal procedure such as previous APR or severe anal stenosis - Performed with USG, CT or MRI guidance and overall diagnostic accuracy appears to be equivalent to TRUS but is associated with higher complication rates
  ➡CT abdomen + pelvis
- Evaluation of regional LN enlargement
- CT-directed biopsy can be used to confirm metastasis if pathologically enlarged LN are detected
  ➡ Multiparametric MRI scan
- Multiparametric (mp) MRI is any functional form of imaging used to supplement standard anatomical T1 and T2-weighted imaging
  - Functional sequences of choice are dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)
- Indications
  - Guide targeted prostate biopsy in patients with and elevated PSA level but -ve TRUS biopsy which is shown to result in reduction in number of unnecessary biopsy, higher yield of significant cancer and fewer biopsy cores
  - Staging tool for T stage based on presence or absence of extra-glandular disease or involvement of neurovascular bundles and seminal vesicles to differentiate T1/2 disease from T3 disease
  - Allow detection or recurrence or residual disease after prostatectomy and allows careful planning of salvage radiation or focal image-guided ablative salvage therapy such as cryotherapy
  - MRI spine is indicated in patients present with bone pain and neurological symptoms to establish the presence and site of cord compression
- Prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) - Reporting system used to characterize and assess all suspicious focal intraglandular prostate lesions - Assessment to be applied by radiologist when interpreting MRI images provides a summary assessment number 1-5 for each focal lesion identified

Headings and subheadings indicate different imaging modalities, such as X-ray, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), CT scan, and multiparametric MRI. Bullet points list specific applications, limitations, and complications of each test. Key terms like "OSTEOBLASTIC" are highlighted in red, and the text generally discusses the sensitivity, specificity, and indications for each imaging technique in the context of prostate cancer detection and management.]

➡Radionuclide bone scan (Bone scintigraphy)

- Indicated in patients with high risk disease when PSA > 10 ng/mL or low risk disease when PSA > 20 ng/mL
- Evaluate spread to osseous sites by assessing areas of increased uptake
  ➡ PET-scan
- Assess pelvic LNs and distant metastasis but of limited utility since cellular uptake of 18-FDG is highly variable

842

VII. Treatment

1. General principles
   ➡Early stage (Stage 1 or 2)

- Radical prostatectomy
- Radiotherapy
  ➡Advanced stage (Stage 3 or 4)
- Hormonal therapy
- Watchful waiting

2. Conservative treatment
   ➡Active surveillance

- Indicated in low-risk prostate cancer ONLY
- An intention to delay radical treatment with a pre-defined criteria to initiate treatment
- Last until patient can no longer benefit from any forms of treatment which is then changed to watchful waiting
- Monitor illness at fixed intervals with DRE and serum PSA measurements
- Repeat prostate biopsy as indicated until histopathological or serological changes correlative of progression warrant treatment with curative intent
  ➡Watchful waiting
- Indicated in advanced age, life-limiting comorbidities or life expectancy < 10 years
- Treatment provided if local or metastatic progression occurs

3. Medical treatment
   ➡Testosterone-lowering agents

- GnRH agonists
  - ↑↑ LH and FSH which stimulates testes to produce testosterone initially which may cause an unwanted disease flare
  - Downregulation of receptors in pituitary glands
  - ↓ LH and FSH secretion by pituitary glands
  - Testosterone secretion by the testes
  - Inhibits growth of prostate cancer
  - Example: Goserelin/ Leuprolide
- GnRH antagonists
  - Testosterone secretion by the testes without an initial rise of testosterone level
  - Inhibits growth of prostate cancer
  - Example: Degarelix
- Side effects of testosterone-lowering agents (androgen-depletion) - Hot flushes/Fatigue/ Erectile dysfunction/Loss of libido/ Anemia/ Gynecomastia
  ➡ Anti-androgens
- Block ligand binding to androgen receptor
- Block disease flare that may occur with the rise of serum testosterone associated with GnRH agonist therapy
- Side effects include gynecomastia
- Example: Flutamide/ Nilutamide/ Bicalutamide

843

➡Bisphosphonates/ RANK-ligand inhibitor

- Prevention of bone loss
- **Bisphosphonates**: Alendronate/ Risedronate/Zoledronate / Ibandronate
- **RANK-ligand inhibitor**: Denosumab
  ➡Symptomatic relief
- α1-adrenergic antagonists (α-blocker)
  - Act against the dynamic component of bladder outlet obstruction
  - Relaxation of smooth muscle in the bladder neck, prostate capsule and prostatic
    urethra
  - Example: Terazosin/ Tamsulosin/ Alfuzosin/ Doxazosin
- 5α-reductase inhibitor (anti-androgens) - Act against the structural component of bladder outlet obstruction - Inhibits conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) - Reduces the size of prostate gland to improve obstructive symptoms - Example: Finasteride/ Dutasteride
  ➡Chemotherapy
- Docetaxel - Leads to PSA declination, disease regression and improvement in both pre-
  existing pain and prevention of future cancer-related pain - Side effects include myelosuppression
  ➡Radiation therapy
- Radiotherapy is given by external beam radiation or by brachytherapy (radioactive
  sources implant into gland)
  - Brachytherapy is for low-risk cancer only
  - External beam irradiation if for intermediate to high-risk cancer
- Standard definition of biochemical failure = Rise in PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL higher than the
  lowest PSA achieved
- Oncological outcomes between radiotherapy or radical surgery are equally favourable and
  the choice of treatment is up to the patient
- Complications - GI: Proctitis/ Enteritis/ Diarrhea/ Frequency/ Urgency/ Tenesmus - UG: Cystitis/ Urethritis/ Frequency/ Urgency/ Dysuria - Erectile dysfunction
  [Image]
  The image shows a listing of complications as follows: GI: Proctitis/Enteritis/Diarrhea/Frequency/Urgency/Tenesmus, UG: Cystitis/Urethritis/Frequency/Urgency/Dysuria, Erectile dysfunction.

844

4. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Radical prostatectomy

- Indications and prerequisite
  - Confirmed histological diagnosis
  - Patients with a life expectancy of > 10 years
  - Patients fully counselled and aware of possible complications and alternative treatment options
  - PSA level < 20 ng/mL (> 20 is much more likely to have spread)
  - Gleason grade < 8 (≥ 8 is much more likely to have spread often at a micrometastatic level)
- Negative bone scan ± Negative MRI scan
- Performed through an open or laparoscopic approach
  - Open approaches including retropubic or perineal approach has become extinct
  - Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted approach is the preferred treatment
- LN are removed between the external iliac vein and obturator vessels bilaterally but can be omitted if probability of involvement is very low
- Oncological outcomes between radiotherapy or radical surgery are equally favourable and the choice of treatment is up to the patient
- Aims and objectives
  - Excise cancer completely with a clear margin
  - Maintain continence by preserving external sphincter
  - Maintain potency by sparing autonomic nerves in the neurovascular bundles
    - Cavernous nerves lie immediately posterolateral to prostatic capsule
- Complications - General perioperative complications (MI/ DVT)/ Bleeding/ Sepsis - Urine leaks - Rectal or ureteral injury - Urethral strictures due to bladder neck contracture - Urinary incontinence* due to damage to urinary sphincter (manage with pelvic floor muscle exercise or artificial sphincter) - Erectile dysfunction* due to damage to cavernous nerve (managed with PDE5 inhibitors or penile prosthesis)
  ➡ Orchiectomy
- Depletion of androgens by surgical means
  - > 90% of male hormones (i.e. testosterone) originate from the testes
  - < 10% of male hormones (i.e. DHEA/ DHEA-S/ androstenedione) originate from adrenals
- GOLD STANDARD but is rarely done nowadays due to effective medical therapy and more widespread use of hormones

VIII. Prevention (Screening)

1. General principles
   ➡ Wilson and Jungner criteria
   (1) The condition sought should be an important health problem
   (2) There should be an accepted treatment for patients with recognized disease
   (3) Facilities for diagnosis and treatment should be available
   (4) There should be a recognizable latent or early asymptomatic stage
   (5) There should be a suitable test or examination
   (6) The test should be acceptable to the population
   (7) The natural history of the condition, including development from latent to declared
   disease should be adequately understood
   (8) There should be an agreed policy on whom to treat as patients
   (9) Cost of case-finding (including diagnosis and treatment of patients diagnosed) should be
   economically balanced in relation to possible expenditure on medical care as a whole
   (10) Case-finding should be a continuing process and not a "once and for all" projects

➡ Background
• Most patient die with the disease but not of the disease
o 5-year-survival rate of patients with cancer confined to the prostate = 100%
o 5-year-survival rate with distant metastasis = 29.3%
• PSA testing leads to a dramatic increase in incidence of prostate cancer
o Majority of newly-diagnosed cancer is clinically localized which lead to an
increase in aggressive treatment intended to cure these early-stage cancer
• Current evidence
o ERSPC: Reported a small absolute survival benefit with PSA screening after 9
years of follow-up but 48 additional patients would need to be diagnosed with
prostate cancer to prevent 1 prostate cancer death
o PLCO: Reported NO benefit for annual PSA and DRE screening after 7 - 10
years of follow-up

Remarks: _ERSPC_ = European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer; _PLCO_ = Prostate,
Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial

➡ Details of screening
• Screening should be discussed with average-risk men beginning at age 50
o Upper age limit to screening is still controversial but clinical data shows a
screening survival benefit only among the core group of men age 55 - 69
• **NOT** with men who have a comorbidity that limits their life expectancy to < 10 years
o Screening for prostate cancer is unlikely to benefit men with less than a 10-year
life expectancy given the generally indolent course of diseases
• Screening every 2 - 4 years with PSA levels is suggested but the optimal interval and
combination of tests remains uncertain

846

2. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
   ➡General features

- Glycoprotein produced by prostate epithelial cells
- PSA is sued to liquefy semen after ejaculation
- Half-life (t1/2) = 2.2 days
- PSA elevation can precede clinical disease by 5-10 years or even longer
  ➡Test performance
- Traditional cutoff for PSA ≥ 4 ng/mL as it balances the tradeoff between missing
  important cancers a t a curable stage and avoiding both detection of clinically
  insignificant disease and subjecting men to unnecessary prostate biopsy
  - Sensitivity = 21% for any prostate cancer; 51% for high-grade cancers
  - Specificity = 60%
  - PPV = 30%
  - NPV = 85%
- Effects of lowering PSA cutoff - Lowering PSA cutoff improves test sensitivity but at the same time reduces
  specificity leading to far more FP results and unnecessary biopsy

3. Methods to improve PSA accuracy
   ➡ Background

- Strategies have been proposed to improve diagnostic performance of PSA when levels fall into "gray zone" of 4 - 10 ng/mL
- Calculation-based strategies
  - Age-specific reference range
  - Race-specific reference range
  - PSA velocity (change of PSA over time)
  - PSA density
- Measurement-based strategies
  - Free PSA level
  - [-2] ProPSA

➡Age-specific reference range

- **40 – 49 years old** = 0 – 2.5 ng/mL
- **50 – 59 years old** = 0 – 3.5 ng/mL
- **60 – 69 years old** = 0 – 4.5 ng/mL
- **70 – 79 years old** = 0 – 6.5 ng/mL

➡ PSA velocity

- PSA level increases more rapidly in men with prostate cancer than in healthy man
- Accurate measurement requires three serial readings ideally with the same assay obtained over at least a 12 – 24 months period
- PSA velocity > 0.75 ng/mL/year has increased risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer and has higher specificity than PSA cutoff level itself (controversial)

> 10 ng/mL > 50% 20-25% 16%
> 25% 8%

The top row highlights the intersection of 0-10% fPSA and a 56% Cancer Probability, an arrow points from this intersection to a text box that says "Biopsy required". The bottom row highlights the intersection of >25% fPSA and an 8% Cancer Probability, an arrow points from this intersection to a text box that says "Monitor patients".]

➡Free PSA level

- Free form of PSA is bound to macromolecules that has been used to develop additional assays to improve test specificity
- ↓Ratio of free-to-total PSA (% fPSA) in patients with prostate cancer
- Interpretation - Free-to-total PSA (% fPSA) < 10% detects prostate cancer up to 56% - Optimal free-to-total PSA (% fPSA) is selected to be ≤ 25% which would reduce the number of unnecessary biopsy by 20% - Normal free-to-total PSA (% fPSA) will still have 8% probability of having cancer which may not be low enough to convince patients and clinician to forego a prostate biopsy - Free-to-total PSA (% fPSA) is generally only clinical helpful at extreme values of the ratio
  [-2]ProPSA level (p2PSA)
- Specific isoform of PSA proenzyme proPSA
- Reduces unnecessary biopsy for men with PSA values between 2 - 10 ng/mL
- Prostate Health Index (PHI) is a derived measure that incorporates %[-2]ProPSA, free PSA and total PSA

4. Harms of screening
   ➡Overdiagnosis

- Overdiagnosis refers to detection by screening of conditions that would not have become clinically significant
- Patients are subject to risks of screening, confirmatory diagnosis and treatment as well as potential psychosocial harm from anxiety and labelling
  ➡Risk of biopsy
- ↑ Risk of bleeding and infection leading to sepsis
- Physical discomfort
  - Post-procedure pain
- Anxiety - Being diagnosed with prostate cancer is psychologically distressing - Negative biopsy result is also distressing since the apparently favourable result cannot completely rule out prostate cancer given the high FN biopsy result
  ➡Risk of therapy
- Aggressive therapy including radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy are provided even with early-staged disease
- Complications include urinary incontinence, bowel dysfunction and sexual dysfunction

849

5. Digital rectal examination (DRE)
   ➡General features

- **NOT** recommended to perform DRE whether alone or in combination with PSA screening for prostate cancer screening - No high-level evidence that combined PSA and DRE improves survival benefit
  ➡Test performance
- Traditional cutoff for PSA ≥ 4 ng/mL - _Sensitivity_ = 59% - _Specificity_ = 94% - PPV = 5 – 30%
  ➡Limitations
- Stage T1 cancers are non-palpable by TNM definition
- Only detects tumours in the posterior and lateral aspect of prostate gland
  - Inherited limitation of DRE such that only 85% of prostate cancer arises peripherally where they can be detected by digital rectal examination (DRE)

## Testicular cancer

I. **Overview**

1. General features
   ➡ Most common solid malignancy affecting males between age 15 – 35
   ➡ Germ cell tumours (GCTs) accounts for 95% of all testicular cancer - Ratio of seminoma to non-seminomatous germ cell tumour (NSGCTs) = 1:1 - Seminoma is more likely to be present with localized disease, indolent growth and a long natural history - Non-seminoma is more likely to spread to retroperitoneal LNs and to distant areas such as the liver, lung, bone and brain via bloodstream

III. Pathophysiology

1. Anatomy

[Anatomical drawing of the scrotum and testis. The scrotum is sliced open to reveal the various layers: superficial fascia, external spermatic fascia, cremaster muscle and fascia, internal spermatic fascia, and the parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis. The epididymis is shown on the side of the testis. The testis itself is labeled as being covered by the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis. Next to this image is a cross section of the testicle showing layers of tissue and the skin of the scrotum, superficial fascia, external spermatic fascia, cremaster fascia, internal spermatic fascia, parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis, visceral layer of tunica vaginalis, tunica albuginea of testis. Also shown are lobules of testis, ductus deferens and epididymis.
Another anatomical drawing shows the vas deferens, epididymis and testicle, the head, body and tail of the epididymis are labelled. Inside the testicle are efferent ductules, area of rete testis, tunica albuginea and lobules.]

➡Tunica vaginalis

- Potential space that encompasses the anterior 2/3 of the testes
- Fluid from a variety of sources can accumulate

V. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Painless nodules or swelling of testicles (common)
   ➡Dull ache or heavy sensation in lower abdomen, perianal area or scrotum
   ➡Acute painful testes
   _ Occurs in 10% of patients
   _ Should be distinguished from testicular torsion
   ➡Gynecomastia
   _ Occurs in 5% of patients
   _ Systemic endocrine manifestation of neoplasms \* Associated with production of hCG by foci of choriocarcinoma or trophoblastic cells in the tumours

2. Signs and symptoms of metastasis
   ➡Neck mass
   _ Supraclavicular LN metastasis
   ➡Cough and dyspnea
   _ Lung metastasis
   ➡Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, GI bleeding
   _ Retroduodenal metastasis
   ➡Lumbar back pain
   _ Metastasis involving para-aortic LNs
   _ Bulky retroperitoneal disease involving the psoas muscles or nerve roots
   ➡ Bone pain
   _ Bone metastasis
   ➡CNS or PNS symptoms
   _ Cerebral, spinal cord or peripheral nerve root involvement
   ➡Unilateral or bilateral lower extremity swelling
   _ Iliac vein or IVC obstruction or thrombosis

3. Paraneoplastic syndrome
   ➡Hyperthyroidism
   _ Marked overproduction of hCG will lead to hyperthyroidism
   _ hCG and TSH has a common a-subunit and a ß-subunit with considerable homology and thus hCG has a weak thyroid stimulating effect

856

VI. **Diagnosis**

1. History taking
   →Medical history

- Cryptorchidism
  - History of undescended testis increases the risk of testicular cancer in both testes with greater risk in the undescended one

2. Testicular examination
   ➡ Inspection

- Groin or scrotal scars
- Groin or scrotal swelling
  ➡ Palpation (bimanual)
- Ask for any pain and start with the normal contralateral testis
- Size/ Border/ Consistency/ Tenderness/ Mobility
  - Normal testis is homogeneous in consistency, non-tender and freely movable
  - Testicular tumour is hard, nodular, irregular and non-tender
- Get above the swelling
  - Able to get above the mass in testicular tumour
- Identify the testis and epididymis
  - Normal testes should be separable from epididymis
  - Mass is inseparable from the testes in testicular tumour
- Transillumination - Transilluminable indicates hydrocele or cyst of epididymis - Testicular tumour does not transilluminate
  ➡ Completion of examination
- Examination of abdomen and groin
  - Examine groin swelling if it is an indirect hernia with scrotal extension
  - Para-aortic LNs are rarely palpable unless extremely large since they are located retroperitoneally
  - Inguinal LNs are not likely to be a response of testicular pathology but rather from the skin of scrotum and penis (CA penis)

857

3. Biochemical tests (Tumour markers = AFP + β-hCG + LDH)
   ➡Tumour markers are used for initial diagnosis and mainly for subsequent follow-up of disease
   status after primary treatment
   ➡Alpha fetoprotein (AFP)

- AFP is **NEVER** elevated in pure seminoma
- AFP is elevated in 80-85% of non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT)
- Other causes of elevations in AFP - Pregnancy - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) - Germ cell tumours - Acute or chronic hepatitis - Liver cirrhosis
  ➡ẞ-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG)
- ẞ-hCG is used since α-subunit is common to several pituitary hormones
- B-hCG is elevated in < 20% of seminoma
- B-hCG is elevated in 80-85% of non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT)
- Other cause of elevations in ẞ-hCG - Pregnancy - Gestational trophoblastic disease - Trophoblastic differentiation of a primary lung cancer - Trophoblastic differentiation of a primary gastric cancer
  ➡X FNAC/ Biopsy
- FNAC and biopsy are **NOT** indicated in diagnosis of testicular cancer due to risk of
  tumour seedling along biopsy tract
- Tumour seedling in the skin of scrotum will drain into the inguinal LNs in which these
  LNs are normally not affected in testicular cancer as the testes drain into paraaortic LNs
  only

4. Radiological tests
   ➡USG scrotum

- Distinguish solid from cystic nature
- Screen the contralateral testes for pathologies
- Seminoma appears as well-defined hypoechoic lesions without cystic areas
- Non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCTs) appears indistinct margins,
  inhomogeneous lesions with cystic areas and calcifications
  ➡CT thorax, abdomen and pelvis
- Imaging modality of choice to evaluate the retroperitoneum
  - Regional metastasis first appear in the retroperitoneal LNs which is the para-aortic
    lymph nodes
  - Abnormal node is defined as > 10 mm to indicate pathological adenopathy

858

VII. Treatment

1. Medical treatment
   ➡Chemotherapy

- Adjuvant chemotherapy can be given to early or advanced stage testicular tumours
- Single-agent therapy
  - Cisplatin/ Carboplatin
- BEP therapy
  - Bleomycin + Etoposide + Cisplatin
    ➡Radiotherapy
- Seminoma is exquisitely sensitive to radiation therapy
- Non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCTs) are more radio-resistant
- Adjuvant radiotherapy can be given to seminoma in early stages but at the risk of secondary radiotherapy-induced malignancies

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡Radical inguinal orchiectomy

- Diagnostic by permitting histological evaluation of primary tumour and therapeutic to provide local tumour control
- Early clumping of testicular artery and vein within the spermatic cord before testis is mobilized out of the scrotum to prevent intraoperative seeding of tumour up the veins
  ➡Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND)
- Reserved for patients with post-chemotherapy residual disease since primary chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for patients with Stage II or III disease
- Requires expertise and has high risk of complications
- Only reliable method to identify nodal micrometastasis given the high FN rate with CT
- GOLD standard for providing acute pathological staging of the retroperitoneum
  ➡Cryopreservation of sperm
- Should be made available to all men diagnosed with testicular cancer prior to instituting therapy if they wish to preserve fertility
- Baseline sperm count and sperm banking should be performed prior to radiographic diagnostic evaluation to avoid radiation exposure of sperm
- Note that testicular tumour are associated with gonadal dysgenesis and ~50% of men have some degree of underlying impairment of spermatogenesis and semen quality may further deteriorate following removal of affected testis

# Nephrological Diseases

## Peritoneal dialysis

I. Overview

1. General features

   ➡ Peritoneal dialysis enables solute and water exchange between capillary blood and dialysate fluid in peritoneal cavity across peritoneal membrane
   - Thin semipermeable membrane
   - Large surface area
   - Highly vascularized

   ➡ Clearance of solutes and water during exchange depends on the balance between movement of solute and water into peritoneal cavity versus absorption from peritoneal cavity

   ➡ Rate of diffusion diminishes with time and eventually stop when equilibration between plasma and dialysate is reached

2. Mechanism of peritoneal dialysis

   ➡ Diffusion
   - Process where molecules in solutions diffuse across semipermeable membrane using a concentration gradient
   - Pulls solutes out of blood from peritoneal capillary network through membrane into intraperitoneal dialysate
   - **MOST** effective for molecules that are not present in dialysis including urea, creatinine, K+, PO43- and other uremic toxins

   ➡ Ultrafiltration
   - Convective process where molecules pass through pores in the membrane using hydrostatic or osmotic pressure gradients
   - Occurs across osmotic pressure gradient between dialysate and blood created by adding dextrose, icodextrin (glucose polymer solution) to dialysate
   - Promotes convective free water movement through aquaporin channels in peritoneal membrane and the convective forces also helps solutes move into peritoneal fluid when the water is moving

860

3. Different types of peritoneal dialysis

[A table with 4 columns and 4 rows. The header row is "PD Mode", "DAY", "NIGHT", "DAY", "NIGHT". The first column contains "CAPD", "CCPD", and "NIPD". The rest of the table contains curves representing peritoneal dialysis methods: CAPD, CCPD, and NIPD.]

➡Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (**CAPD**)

- Manual peritoneal dialysis that involves filling of intraperitoneal space with dialysis solution through indwelling catheter followed by emptying several hours later
- Multiple exchanges during the day (usually 3) followed by an overnight dwell
  ➡Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD)
- Utilizes cycler programmed to perform dialysis according to treatment requirement
- Overnight cycler device that infuses and drains more rapidly with shorter dwells
- Preferred mode of dialysis for majority of patients because it frees up majority of their waking hours
- Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (**CCPD**)
  - Dialysis performed for the full 24-hour period (abdomen full during the day)
  - NIPD followed by filling of abdomen with dialysis solution at the end of APD cycle with abdomen full during the day
- Nocturnal intermittent peritoneal dialysis (**NIPD**)
  - Dialysis performed only at night (abdomen empty during the day)
  - Total abdominal drainage during exchange

II. Indications and contraindications

1. Indications
   ➡Acute kidney injury (AKI)

- A = Acidosis: Refractory metabolic acidosis with HCO3 < 10 mmol/L
- E = Electrolyte disturbance: Uncontrolled hyperkalemia > 6 mmol/L
- I = Intoxication: Alcohol/ NSAIDs/ acetaminophen/ metformin
- O = Oedema: Refractory fluid overload/ Uncontrolled pulmonary edema
- U = Uremia: Uremic pericarditis/ Uremic encephalopathy/ Intractable uremic symptoms
  ➡ Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
- Patients with GFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m² (OR) Stage 5 CKD
- Patients becomes symptomatic of uremia
  - Presents as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, pericarditis, peripheral neuropathy and CNS abnormalities such as loss of concentration, lethargy, seizures and coma
  - NO direct correlation exists between the absolute serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or creatinine and the development of symptoms

2. Contraindications
   ➡Previous extensive abdominal surgery (scarring)
   ➡Frequent PD-related peritonitis
   ➡Place of residence that does not permit peritoneal dialysis or residence lacking sanitary conditions

861

III. Technical details

[Image of a PD catheter laying on a blue surface. The catheter is a clear tube with markings labeled "Cuff" and "Sides holes" with arrows pointing to them. The title below is "PD catheter (Tenckhoff catheter)".]

[Image of a person's abdomen with a PD catheter inserted. The image is a close-up of the lower abdomen with the catheter exiting the skin. Labels point to the "Exit site", "Paramedian incision", and "PD catheter" with arrows.]

[Image of an X-ray of a person's abdomen with a PD catheter inserted. The catheter is visible inside the abdominal cavity. A label points to "PD catheter" with an arrow.]

1. Access to the peritoneal cavity
   ➡ PD catheter (Tenckhoff catheter)

- Catheter insertion site
  - **Entrance site** = Paramedian incision is created
  - Insertion ≥ 2 weeks before start of dialysis may decrease pericatheter leaks
    - Scarring that occurs around the cuffs anchors the catheter and seals it from bacteria tracking from the skin surface into the peritoneal cavity and prevents external leakage of fluid from the peritoneal cavity
- Placement of PD catheter
  - Tip should be pointing downwards inside pelvic cavity since the pelvis is the most dependent part of the body when patient is undergoing dialysis in a sitting position
- Catheter exit site
  - **Exit site** = Lateral and caudal to entrance site
  - Upward facing exit site should be avoided to prevent accumulation of bacteria, debris, perspiration and shower water
  - Exit site should be visible by patient and should not be located at the belt line, skin creases or skin folds
  - Exit site is usually on the left side since migration is more likely on the right side due to upward direction of peristalsis and right side can be reserved for renal transplant as there is wide choice of vessels for reconstruction and vessels are more superficial for anastomosis

2. Dialysis solutions
   ➡ Osmotic agents

| Types          | Description                                        |

| **LMW agents** | Glucose (Dextrose\*)                               | ➡ **MOST** commonly used agents which comes in different concentrations including 1.5% (小水)/2.5%(中水)/4.25%(大水) ➡ **NOT** an ideal osmotic agent since it is _ Easily absorbed leading to short-lived ultrafiltration _ Leads to metabolic complications including metabolic syndrome (hyperglycemia + hyperlipidemia + weight gain) \* Presence of glucose degradation products (GDP) which affects peritoneal host defence mechanism by inhibiting phagocytosis and bactericidal activity |
| **HMW agents** | Low GDP solution (Biocompatible solution)          | ➡ Neutral pH-low GDP is developed in an attempt to decrease the number of GDPs in dialysis solutions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|                | Glucose-polymer-containing solution (Icodextrin\*) | ➡ Decreased absorption of solute and thus increases ultrafiltration for a longer duration ➡ Reduced carbohydrate dose provides some long-term metabolic advantages ➡ Particularly useful for patients with DM, those who require long dwell and patients whose ultrafiltration capacity may need to be enhanced                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                | Amino-acid-based solution                          | ➡ Improves nutritional status in PD patients _ Absorbed amino acids from PD solution might help contribute to protein synthesis ➡ Malnutrition is common in PD patients and has been associated with higher mortality and hospitalization rates _ Helpful for patients with protein and energy malnutrition as a result of loss of protein and amino acids from effluent                                                                                                                         |

➡ Buffers and electrolytes

- Lactated-buffered, balanced salt solution devoid of K+ usually with glucose (dextrose) as the osmotic agent

| Composition | Content                            | Rationale                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Volume      | 1.5 – 3.0 L (usually 2 – 2.5)      | ➡ Infused into peritoneal cavity and dwell for around 2 – 4 hours                                                                                                     |
| Glucose     | 1.5% (小水)/2.5%(中水)/4.25%(大水) | ➡ Osmotic agent for fluid removal                                                                                                                                     |
| K+          | 0 mmol/L                           | ➡ Patients are usually hyperkalemic ➡ K+ devoid dialysate tends to maintain serum K+ at around 4 mEq/L                                                                |
| Na+         | 132 mmol/L                         | ➡ Water removal from blood exceed Na+ removal in PD since fluid removal is mainly by convection ➡ Relatively low Na+ thus prevents hypernatremia due to fluid removal |
| Ca2+        | 2.5 – 3.5 mmol/L                   | ➡ Ca2+ replacement since patients is usually hypocalcemic                                                                                                             |

-> Common additives to PD solutions

- Heparin to prevent obstruction of dialysis catheter lumen with fibrin
- Antibiotics during an episode of acute peritonitis
- Insulin added in patients with DM (intraperitoneal insulin)
  - Insulin is a better option than oral hypoglycemic agents which may have a prolonged half-life in ESRD with risk of hypoglycemia
  - Advantages: Intraperitoneal insulin is directly absorbed into the splanchnic system and can be continuous absorbed with dialysate glucose during a peritoneal dialysis dwell
  - Disadvantages: Much higher dose is needed due to adsorption to plastic bags and tubes and incomplete absorption/ Introduction of organisms into dialysate with each intraperitoneal insulin administration

[Image Description: The image is a scanned document page with some text. The page number 864 is located at the bottom right corner of the image. The image shows a list of common additives to PD solutions, including Heparin, Antibiotics and Insulin. For Insulin, there is a short paragraph about how Insulin is a better option than oral hypoglycemic agents and some advantages and disadvantages are listed]

IV. Assessment of adequacy of PD

1. Solute and fluid removal
   ➡Weekly Kt/Vurea (PD + Residual renal function)

- Calculated by adding together PD urea clearance with clearance from residual renal function which is determined from
  - 24-hour urine collection
  - 24-hour dialysate effluent collection and measurement of total volume
- Urea concentration of effluent and plasma
- Target Weekly Kt/V urea
  - Minimum weekly Kt/V urea ≥ 1.7/week
  - Underdialysis should be managed by either increasing the volume of dialysate per exchange or number of exchanges

➡Solute clearance provided by peritoneal dialysis (PD)

- Kt = Daily peritoneal urea clearance
  - Kt = Dialysate volume (L) x [Dialysate urea/ Plasma urea]
- Vurea = Volume of distribution of urea
  - Vurea = Weight (kg) x Age/Gender-specific fraction of body weight
    - Non-elderly male/ Children = 0.6
    - Non-elderly female/ Elderly male = 0.5
    - Elderly female = 0.45
- Daily renal Kt/V urea = Kt/V urea
- Weekly Kt/V urea (from PD) = Daily Kt/V urea x 7

➡Solute clearance provided by residual renal function

- Urea clearance (mL/min) = Urine volume x [Urine urea nitrogen/ Plasma urea nitrogen]
- Daily urea clearance (mL/day) = Urea clearance (mL/min) x 1440 mins/day
- Vurea = Volume of distribution of urea
  - Vurea = Weight (kg) x Age/Gender-specific fraction of body weight
    - Non-elderly male/ Children = 0.6
    - Non-elderly female/ Elderly male = 0.5
    - Elderly female = 0.45
- Daily renal Kt/V urea (from residual renal function) = Daily urea clearance / Vurea
- Weekly Kt/V urea (from residual renal function) = Daily renal Kt/V urea x 7

2. Peritoneal membrane function
   ➡Peritoneal equilibrium test (PET)

- Formal evaluation of peritoneal membrane characteristics that measure the transfer rate of creatinine and glucose across peritoneal membrane
  - Dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine at 4 hours
- Ratio of glucose concentration in dialysate at 4 hours to initial level
- Patients are classified as low, low-average, high-average and high transporters
  - High transporters tend to lose larger quantities of albumin and other proteins and thus require the use of more frequent and shorter dwell time exchanges, nearly always obligating the use of cycler
  - Slow transporters tend to do well with fewer exchanges and larger volume allow greater solute clearance

865

V. Complications

1. Catheter-associated complications
   ➡Catheter insertion

- Pericatheter leakage
- Bleeding
  - If damage the inferior epigastric artery
- Injury to visceral organs
  - Perforation of bowel, sigmoid and bladder
- Mechanical flow dysfunction
  - Catheter kinking
  - Catheter malposition (Tip of catheter may occasionally migrate out of pelvis leading to poor drainage of peritoneal dialysis fluid)
  - Obstruction due to blood clot or fibrin
  - Catheter failure - Failure usually due to omental wrapping (blockage) - Need Tenckhoff revision with omentectomy
    ➡Catheter-associated infection
- Exit-site infections
  - Indicated by the presence of purulent discharge with or without erythema of skin around catheter insertion site
- Tunnel infections
  - Indicated by the presence of inflammation or collection along catheter tunnel as determined by USG
  - Presents with erythema, edema, tenderness or induration along catheter tunnel but often clinically occult

2. PD-associated complications
   ➡Metabolic complications

- Metabolic syndrome (Hyperglycemia + Hyperlipidemia + Weight gain)
  - Several hundred calories in the form of dextrose are absorbed each day depending on the concentration employed
- Hypoalbuminemia
  - Albumin and other proteins can be lost across the peritoneal membrane in concert with the loss of metabolic wastes
  - Obligates a higher dietary protein intake in order to maintain nitrogen balance

866

➡CAPD peritonitis

- General features
  - Primary peritonitis presenting with fever, abdominal pain and turbid PD fluid
  - Chronic exposure to dextrose containing PD fluid and repeated peritonitis will cause fibrosis of peritoneal membrane leading to PD failure which is the major reason for conversion to long-term hemodialysis
- Risk factors
  - Catheter-associated infection (exit-site and tunnel infections)
  - Lacking sanitary conditions in living environment
  - Living far away from dialysis unit
  - Underlying GI pathology (cholecystitis/ appendicitis/ diverticulitis)
  - Recent invasive interventions (colonoscopy/ cystoscopy/ hysteroscopy)
  - Nasal carriage of S. aureus
  - Constipation
  - Smoking
- Microbiology
  - Gram +ve: Staphylococcus sp. (Particularly coagulase -ve)
  - Gram -ve: E. coli/ Campylobacter/ Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  - Fungal infections
- Diagnostic criteria
  - Clinically features indicative of peritonitis such as fever, abdominal pain or cloudy effluent
    - Absence of fever does not exclude peritonitis since the infection can be localized or low-grade
  - WBC count ≥ 100 cells/mm³ and percentage of neutrophils (PMNs) > 50% in peritoneal fluid after dwell time ≥ 2 hours
    - Cutoff is lower than in SBP because of the presence of dextrose in PD solutions and thus there will be rapid bacterial proliferation in this environment without antibiotic therapy
  - +ve Peritoneal dialysate effluent culture
- Treatment
  - Gram +ve: 1st generation cephalosporin (cefazolin) or Vancomycin
    - Vancomycin should be avoided as initial treatment to minimize emergence of resistant strains
  - Gram -ve: Aminoglycoside or 3rd or 4th generation cephalosporin (ceftazidime/ cefepime)
    - Replacing aminoglycoside with 3rd generation cephalosporin is advocated to preserve residual renal function and avoid ototoxicity
  - Indications for catheter removal - Refractory peritonitis with failure of effluent to clear up after 5 days of antimicrobial treatment (put on temporary hemodialysis with antibiotics continued) - Peritonitis due to hydrophilic gram -ve rods (e.g. Pseudomonas sp.) or fungal infection (e.g. yeast) (Antimicrobial therapy is usually not sufficient and PD catheter removal is required to ensure complete eradication of infection)

# Nephrological diseases

## Hemodialysis vascular access

I. **Overview**

1. General features

[Image of a Standard Radiocephalic AV Fistula at the Wrist: The image depicts a cross-sectional view of a human wrist and hand with the cephalic vein and radial artery labeled. The cephalic vein is positioned closer to the surface of the skin on the back of the wrist, while the radial artery is deeper and closer to the thumb side. The vein and artery are connected directly, forming an arteriovenous fistula. Small red arrows show the blood flowing from the artery to the vein through the new connection.]

[Image of a Tunneled Cuffed Double-Lumen Central Venous Catheter Inserted in the Right Internal Jugular Vein: The image shows the upper part of a human torso with a catheter inserted into the right internal jugular vein. The catheter is tunneled under the skin before entering the vein. The superior vena cava and right atrium are visible, highlighting the catheter's path. The catheter is a double-lumen type, with two external ports connected to the tunneled section. The heart is partially visible and blood is flowing through the vein in an upward direction.]

➡ Recommended type of **chronic** hemodialysis vascular access

- **AV fistula** > AV graft > Central hemodialysis catheter
- AV fistula is preferred over AV graft since a mature AV fistula has the lowest morbidity and mortality, lowest need for intervention and best long-term patency
- Central hemodialysis catheter is consistently associated with worse complication and survival rates and should be avoided if possible
- Central hemodialysis catheter is an acceptable option in the following cases
  - AV access is exhausted
  - AV access is contraindicated (e.g. severe heart failure)
  - Expected duration of dialysis < 1 year

868

II. Arteriovenous (AV) hemodialysis access

1. General features
   ➡Arterial and venous vascular mapping should be performed in all patients before placement of an access with Duplex USG
   ➡ Comparison between AV fistula and AV graft

| Complications                  | ➡ Lower risk of thrombosis <br> ➡ Lower risk of infection | ➡ Higher risk of thrombosis <br> ➡ Higher risk of infection |

Remarks: Primary failure is defined as an AV access that never provided reliable access for hemodialysis

2. Arteriovenous (AV) fistula
   ➡ Deliberate connection between a native artery and vein
   ➡Maturation of AV fistula and graft

- Minimum time for maturation for AV fistula = 4 weeks
- Minimum time for maturation for AV graft = 3 - 6 weeks
- AV fistula must be adequately mature to allow repeated cannulation - Native vein has thin wall and is rather fragile - High pressure and flow artificially introduced when a fistula is created causes the involved vein to undergo changes by dilation and thickening of the wall
  ➡End-to-side vein-to-artery anastomosis is preferred
- Retrograde flow from distal radial artery enter the fistula conduit
- Retrograde flow originates from ulnar artery and enters distal radial artery through the palmar arch which contribute to the high proximal venous flow

| End-to-side <br> (preferred) | ➡High proximal venous flow <br> Less venous thrombosis <br> ➡ **NO** venous hypertension                                                | ➡Vascular steal syndrome <br> - Convert to end-to-end                                                                             |

| End-to-end                   | ➡Fistula flow is limited thus preventing hypercirculatory state <br> ➡ **NO** vascular steal syndrome <br> ➡ **NO** venous hypertension | ➡ Technically more demanding <br> ➡ Lowest proximal venous flow <br> _(absence of retrograde flow)_ <br> - More venous thrombosis |

➡ Types of AVF (descending order of preference)

- **Radial-cephalic AVF**
  - Most straightforward to create
  - Preserve proximal arm vessels for later access attempts
- **Brachial-cephalic AVF**
  - Higher blood flow but high incidence of vascular steal phenomenon
  - Easier to be created than brachial-basilic AVF requiring less dissection
  - Easier to be cannulated than brachial-basilic due to the lateral and relatively superficial location of cephalic vein and its shorter length
- **Brachial-basilic AVF**
  - Basilic vein is deeply positioned and less accessible for venepuncture normally and hence better preserved and less involved with post-phlebitic changes
  - Higher blood flow but high incidence of vascular steal phenomenon
  - Difficult to be created since the basilic vein has to be elevated and transposed to make it usable as a hemodialysis access
  - Difficult to cannulate due to the medial and relatively deeper location of basilic vein and its shorter length

Remarks: Cephalic-based AVF is more easily created; Brachial-based AVF is associated with high fistula flow but higher risk of vascular steal phenomenon

3. Arteriovenous (AV) graft
   ➡ Indicated in patients with inadequate size and quality of vessels for AVF

- Constructed by interposing a prosthetic graft between an artery and vein
  - Typically with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)
    ➡ Common graft locations
  - Looped forearm (**Brachial artery** to **cephalic vein**)
  - Straight forearm (**Radial artery** to **cephalic vein**)
  - Looped upper arm (**Axillary artery** to **axillary vein**)
  - Straight upper arm (**Brachial artery** to **axillary vein**)

870

4. Examination of AV fistula
   ➡ Inspection

- Appearance of fistula
  - No overlying skin changes including erythema and swelling suggesting infection and inflammation associated with fistula
  - No focal masses or bulging area and no areas of marked thinning, ulceration or spontaneous bleeding suggestive of aneurysm formation
- Distal extremities
  - No evidence of distal ischemia such as pallor and cool in temperature indicating vascular steal phenomenon (compare with contralateral limb)
  - No edema or swelling of distal extremity indicating venous hypertension
- Elevation of arm - Normal AVF collapse when arm is elevated to level above heart - Presence of venous stenosis will lead to collapse of the portion proximal to lesion and the portion distal to the lesion will remain distended
  ➡ Palpation
- Skin overlying flowing fistula is warm in temperature
- Palpation should **NOT** elicit any tenderness normally
- Presence of pulsation
  - Best appreciated with fingers rather than hands
  - Pulse in fistula should be evaluated along the length of fistula from AV anastomosis through venous outflow
  - Pulse in the distal extremities should also be evaluated
  - When normal fistula is occluded a short distance from the AV anastomosis the arterial pulse at wrist should be increased in which reduced augmentation suggest arterial stenosis
- Presence of thrills
  - Best appreciated with hands rather than fingers
  - Normal AV fistula is characterized by soft continuous diffuse thrill that is palpable over the course of fistula and most prominent over AV anastomosis with both a systolic and diastolic component
- Direction of flow - Direction of flow is easily determined by occluding the fistula with tip of fingers and palpating each side of occlusion point for a pulse - Side without a pulse is the downstream side - Distal extremity pulse should be increased during the occlusion
  ➡ Auscultation
- Presence of bruit
  - Bruit over a well-functioning fistula has a low-pitched, soft, machinery-like rumbling sound with both a systolic and diastolic component

### III. Central hemodialysis catheter

1. Overview

[Image Description: This image shows two illustrations of central venous catheters inserted into the neck of a patient. The first illustration, labeled "A Non-tunneled catheter," shows a catheter inserted directly into the jugular vein without any subcutaneous tunneling. The second illustration, labeled "B Tunneled catheter," shows a catheter that is tunneled under the skin before entering the jugular vein. In the top right corner of the image are two small pictures, labeled "Uncuffed" and "Cuffed," showing two types of catheters, the cuffed catheter having a cuff around the part of it that is located under the skin.]

➡Tunnelled VS Non-tunnelled central venous catheter

| Types         | Usage     | Examples                                     | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Non-tunnelled | Immediate | ➡Acute kidney injury (AKI)                   | ➡Relatively rigid to ease insertion and thus higher risk to perforate through great veins or heart |
|               |           | ➡Thrombosed hemodialysis access              |                                                                                                    |
|               |           | ➡Poisoning                                   |                                                                                                    |
| Tunnelled     | Long-term | ➡Chronic kidney disease (CKD)                | ➡Lower risk of infection with a cuffed catheter                                                    |
|               |           | ➡Poor candidates for AV access               | ➡Larger size available allowing greater blood flow rates                                           |
|               |           | ➡Pending maturation of a permanent AV access |                                                                                                    |

➡Double lumen VS Triple lumen of dialysis catheter

- Red port: Arterial lumen
  - Draws blood from the body (proximal opening)
- Blue port: Venous lumen
  - Return of blood from dialysis machine to the patient (distal opening)
- Extra port
  - Located between red and blue ports
  - Available for blood drawing and administer IV fluids or drugs to diminish the need for additional central venous catheter and peripheral IV devices

➡ Cuffed VS Non-cuffed

- Tissue ingrowth into the cuff seals off the catheter tunnel and reduces the risk of infection
  ➡ Remarks
- Surface-coated catheters such as antimicrobial and anti-thrombogenic catheters are designed to prevent intravascular catheter infections and catheter-related thrombosis
  873

2. Catheter placement
   ➡Access site considerations (descending order of preference)

- Internal jugular vein (IJV) (**most common**)
  - Right IJV is preferred since it takes a straight path into SVC
  - Left IJV is **NOT** preferred since it has to make two right angles prior to reaching SVC and has difficulty of insertion
- External jugular vein (EJV)
  - EJV enters the subclavian vein at right angle and perforation of EJV can occur
- Common femoral vein
  - Indicated in bilateral occlusion of central thoracic vein
  - Avoids complications associated with thoracic central venous access such as pneumothorax and air embolism
- Subclavian vein
  - Indicated if internal and external jugular veins are occluded and common femoral vein is not a good option
  - High risk of subclavian vein thrombosis and is generally not preferred
    ➡ Technique
- Real-time ultrasound-guidance
  - Recommended for venous access during placement of central venous catheter
  - Used to assess vein size and patency prior to venous puncture
  - Minimize incidence of complication such as arterial puncture or pneumothorax
- Surface mark the IJV at the centre of the triangle formed by the 2 lower heads of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle and the clavicle
- Palpate the carotid artery and ensure that the needle enters the skin lateral to the artery
- Direct the needle caudally along sagittal plane and aiming towards the ipsilateral nipple
- Cannulate the vein via the Seldinger technique (below)
  - Refers to the use of a guidewire placed into a vessel to provide a conduit for intravascular device placement
- Catheter positioning
  - Tip of non-tunnelled catheter should be positioned in SVC
  - Tip of tunnelled catheter should be positioned in RA
- Perform fluoroscopy to confirm position
- Perform CXR to confirm position and exclude pneumothorax

# Nephrological Diseases

## Renal transplantation

I. **Overview**

1. General features
   - Renal replacement therapy (RRT) refers to therapy that replaces lost functions of the kidneys in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
     - Renal transplantation is one of the modalities of RRT and remains the treatment of choice in end-stage renal disease (ESRD)

II. **Immunopathology**

[A diagram titled "Chromosome 6" shows a representation of the human chromosome 6, with a highlighted region labeled "MHC Region". Below, there's a breakdown of the MHC region into MHC Class II, MHC Class III, and MHC Class I genes, each visually represented as segments of the chromosome. Arrows point downwards, leading to more detailed representations of the genes, including specific genes like HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR, TNF, C4, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-A. These genes are depicted with their respective structures and directional arrows indicating their genetic flow.]

1. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
   - MHC houses HLA genes
     - MHC Class I: Present on all nucleated cells and platelets
     - MHC Class II: Expressed on APCs (antigen presenting cells)
     - MHC Class III: Does not code for HLA but contains genes for other components involved in inflammation and other immune complexes

2. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes
   - HLA genes are blueprints to show how cells should organized amino acids to make proteins and are located on chromosome 6
   - HLA genes are passed down from parents to child
     - Each person gets two copies of each gene one from father and one from mother
     - As each parent has two copies of each gene there are 4 possible combinations of genes that can be passed down to children
   - HLA genes are highly polymorphic
     - Human has 12 HLA genes or antigens per individual dual to diploid chromosomes
     - Individual can express 6 different types of MHC Class I molecules and 6 different types of MHC Class II molecules on the cell surface
     - Polymorphism increases the diversity of peptides being produced
   - Different types of HLA genes
     - Class I HLA genes: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C
       - Encodes production of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C antigens
     - Class II HLA genes: HLA-DRA1, HLA-DRB1/3/4/5, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1
       - Encodes production of HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP antigens

3. Factors affecting graft survival
   ➡ABO compatibility

- Compatible blood group
  - Group A → Group A or AB
  - Group B → Group B or AB
  - Group AB → Group AB
  - Group O → ALL groups
- Extreme lack of available deceased-donor organs encouraged investigation into desensitization for ABO incompatibility for living-donor transplant currently - Desensitization protocol uses two methods to reduce circulating ABO antibody titres including plasmapheresis and immunoabsorption in recipients
  ➡HLA compatibility
- Good HLA matching correlates with better graft survival
- Significance - CANNOT accept HLA mismatch in bone marrow transplantation - Can accept HLA mismatch in solid organ transplantation
  ➡Presence of anti-HLA antibodies
- Anti-HLA antibodies will target against HLA antigens expressed on surface of allograft
- Patients may be sensitized to HLA via pregnancy, previously administered blood products or prior transplantation which leads to formation of anti-HLA antibodies
- Crossmatch is performed prior to transplantation to evaluate for any evidence of preformed antibodies with specificity for the potential donor that could lead to hyperacute or acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR)
  ➡HLA and transplantation
- Liver/Heart/ Lung/ Corneal transplantation
  - Availability of donor organ and physical size of organ outweigh importance of HLA matching
- Kidney transplantation
  - Matched HLA antigens at serological level required including HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR
- Stem cell/ Bone marrow transplantation
  - CANNOT accept HLA mismatch in bone marrow transplantation
  - Matching for HLA Class I and II genes at allelic level is crucial
  - Must include HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1 genes
  - HLA-DPA1/B1, HLA-DQA1/B1 genes is extended in some centres
- Cord blood transplantation - 4/6 HLA matching required - Low resolution HLA Class I match required - High resolution HLA Class II match required
  ➡Hepatitis status
- HBsAg +ve → HBsAg +ve recipients
- HBsAg -ve → HBsAg -ve recipients
  - HBV carrier is relatively prevalent (8%) and thus HBsAg +ve recipients need not receive HBsAg -ve donor graft and can wait for HBsAg +ve donor graft
  - HBsAg -ve graft should therefore be reserved for HBsAg -ve recipients whenever possible
- HCV +ve → HCV +ve recipients
- HCV -ve → HCV -ve or HCV +ve recipients
  - HCV carrier is uncommon and may not live long enough if they have to wait for a HCV +ve donor graft and hence can receive HCV -ve donor graft as well

III. Transplantation prerequisite

1. Donor's requirement
   ➡Requirements for living donor

- Good past health
- Normal renal structure and function
  ➡Requirements for deceased donor
- Irreversible brain damage leading to brainstem death
- Normal renal structure and function
- No known history of kidney disease
- No known history of long-standing HT or DM

2. Recipient's requirement (Indications of renal replacement therapy)
   ➡Acute kidney injury (AKI)

- A = Acidosis: Metabolic acidosis with HCO3- < 10 mmol/L
- E = Electrolyte disturbance: Uncontrolled hyperkalemia > 6 mmol/L
- I = Intoxication
- O = Oedema: Fluid overload/ Uncontrolled pulmonary edema
- U = Uremia: Uremic pericarditis/ Uremic encephalopathy/ Intractable uremic symptoms
  ➡ Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
- Patients with GFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m² (OR) Stage 5 CKD
- Patients becomes symptomatic of uremia
  - Presents as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, pericarditis, peripheral neuropathy and CNS abnormalities such as loss of concentration, lethargy, seizures and coma
  - NO direct correlation exists between the absolute serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or creatinine and the development of symptoms

IV. Transplantation procedures

1. Preparation
   ➡Donor nephrectomy

- ALWAYS ask for any siblings available for kidney donation
- Laparoscopic nephrectomy for living donor
- Open nephrectomy for deceased donor
  ➡ Screening
- TB + HBV + HCV + HIV
  - Corresponding prophylaxis should be given accordingly
- G6PD deficiency - Cotrimoxazole (Septrin) is commonly prescribed following renal transplantation to prevent infection against pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) - Cotrimoxazole is contraindicated in G6PD deficiency patients due to risk of hemolysis and should be substituted by pentamidine
  [Image Description: The number 878 is printed in the bottom right corner of the page. It appears to be a page number.]

2. Implantation of renal allograft
   ➡Incision

- Gibson incision
  - Curvilinear incision in the lower quadrant of the abdomen
  - Division of muscles of abdominal wall and dissection of retroperitoneal space to expose iliac vessels and bladder
- Hockey stick incision
  - Inverted J-shaped incision
    ➡Native kidneys
- Removal of native kidneys are usually **NOT** required
  - Failed native kidneys seldom pose a threat to patient when left in place even though they are incapable of filtering adequately
- Nephrectomy of native kidneys are indicated in the following conditions
  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
  - Polycystic kidney disease (PKD)
  - Pyelonephritis
    ➡Placement of graft
- Right iliac fossa (RIF)
  - Exposure of iliac vessels in RIF is greater than LIF as in the right external iliac vein is more superficial and accessible than the left for vascular anastomosis
  - In case iliac vessels are proven unsuitable on the right side it is easier to move up to the aorta and IVC while still remaining retroperitoneal
- Extraperitoneal (retroperitoneal) position
  - Potential retroperitoneal space is created by making a LLQ/RLQ incision
  - Facilitates assessment by palpation, auscultation and biopsy
  - Staying out of peritoneal cavity allows more rapid return of bowel function and any hemorrhage or urine leak is confined to a small non-absorptive space making diagnosis easier and more rapid
- Other positions can be considered
  - Presence of enlarged native kidneys such as in PKD in which graft should be placed in the side of smaller native kidney
  - Some suggest left kidney should be placed in RIF and vice versa since the renal veins lie anterior to renal artery in native position but external iliac vein lies posterior to external iliac artery
    ➡Procedures
- Renal artery (donor) anastomosis to internal or external iliac artery (recipient)
  - Internal iliac artery is **NOT** preferred since anastomosis to internal iliac artery will reduce blood flow to pelvic organs leading to erectile dysfunction
  - Internal iliac artery is difficult to dissect since mobilization of a tract of external and common iliac arteries is also needed which increase the operative time and risk of surgical complications
- Renal vein (donor) anastomosis to external iliac vein (recipient)
- Anastomosis of ureter to the bladder by ureteroneocystostomy
  - Reconstruction of urinary tract by passing donor ureter through a tunnel carved through the dome of posterior bladder wall and sewn to inner bladder mucosa

➡ Monitoring of renal allograft function
• Serum creatinine and GFR
◦ Nearly all patients have a decreased GFR following transplantation if compared with normal native kidney function
• Urine dipstick (Urinalysis) for proteinuria/ Spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)
◦ Screen for proteinuria at 3, 6, 12 months and every 12 months thereafter
◦ Mild proteinuria following transplantation predicts decreased long-term graft function and is associated with mortality
◦ Proteinuria may also suggest acute allograft rejection, transplant glomerulopathy or de novo or recurrent disease
• Allograft renal biopsy
◦ Performed when there is evidence of allograft dysfunction such as elevated serum creatinine, decreased urine output or worsening proteinuria

➡ Screening of post-transplant infections
• CMV
◦ Monitoring of CMV viral load with PCR, CMV IgG and CMV pp65-antigen
◦ (Oral) Valganciclovir or (IV) Ganciclovir should be initiated if viremia is detected
• Polyomavirus (BK and JC virus) infection
◦ Blood and urine DNA PCR after transplantation
◦ Mainstay of treatment is reduction of immunosuppressive dose
• Asymptomatic bacteriuria
◦ Urinalysis and microscopy ± culture after transplantation to screen for UTI

3. Rejection prophylaxis
   ➡ General features
   • Long-term immunosuppressant is needed to prevent rejection of transplanted kidney by recipient's immune system
   • Risk of rejection is highest in the first 3 - 6 months after transplantation
   ➡ 3 immunosuppressants are used concurrently to minimize the side effects of individual drugs while achieving adequate immunosuppression
   • Corticosteroids (e.g. Prednisolone) (**AND**)
   • Calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. Cyclosporine/Tacrolimus) (**AND**)
   • Any of the following: Azathioprine/ Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)/ mTOR kinase inhibitors (e.g. Sirolimus)
   • Remarks: MOST common combination = Prednisolone + Tacrolimus + MMF

[A white background with a table on it that summarizes the effects of Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies and Corticosteroids. The table is divided into Example, Description, Mechanism of Action and Adverse Effects for each of the medications. The example for Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies is: IL-2 receptor antagonists (IV), Basiliximab, Daclizumab. The description includes Indications and the fact that it is for Rejection prophylaxis in transplant recipients. The mechanism of action indicates that Anti-CD25 antibodies block IL-2 receptor on activated T-cells. Further, it inhibits IL-2 mediated T-cell activation and proliferation. The adverse effects indicate no side effects.
The example for Corticosteroids is: Prednisone / Methylprednisolone. The description includes the fact that it is a non-specific anti-inflammatory agent. The mechanism of action describes the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B activation (NFκB). It also binds to glucocorticoid response elements in cytokine genes. Further, it inhibits cytokine production by T cells and macrophages, and disrupts T-cell activation and macrophage-mediated tissue injury. The adverse effects are Cushingoid changes, Moon face, Buffalo hump, Truncal obesity, Supraclavicular fat pads, Cataracts, Peptic ulcer disease (PID), Proximal myopathy, Thinning of skin, Osteoporosis/ AVN, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Glucose intolerance, Immunosuppression, Infection and Malignancy.]

V. **Complications**

1. Renal allograft dysfunction
   ➡Acute allograft rejection

- Acute increase in serum creatinine > 20% after excluding other causes
- Presents as fever, oliguria, ankle edema, hypertension and graft tenderness
- Arrange urgent Duplex USG kidney and consider renal biopsy
  ➡Causes of allograft dysfunction
- Immediate post-transplantation allograft dysfunction
  - Hyperacute and acute antibody-mediated allograft rejection
  - Post-ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
  - Renal artery or vein thrombosis
  - Hypovolemia (secondary to anesthetic vasodilatation)
  - Early acute allograft dysfunction
- Acute allograft rejection
  - Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity
  - Viral infection (e.g. CMV)
  - Urinary tract obstruction
  - Urinary leak due to ureteral necrosis, bladder injury or obstruction
  - Hypovolemia (↓ Fluid intake)
- Late chronic allograft dysfunction (Syndrome characterized by slow progressive decrease
  in renal graft function, proteinuria, hypertension and histological features of interstitial
  fibrosis and tubular atrophy) - Chronic allograft nephropathy - Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity - Viral infection (e.g. CMV) - Hypertensive nephrosclerosis - Recurrence or de novo renal disease

## Carotid artery stenosis

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Carotid artery atherosclerosis occurs most commonly at the bifurcation of common carotid artery
   often with extension into proximal ICA

- Plaque ulceration, thrombosis and embolism are important in pathogenesis of clinical
  manifestations

2. Symptomatic **VS** Asymptomatic
   ➡Symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease

- Focal neurological symptoms in carotid artery territory referable to the appropriate
  carotid artery distribution (ipsilateral to significant carotid atherosclerotic pathology) - Includes ≥ 1 TIA manifested by focal neurological dysfunction or transient
  monocular blindness (amaurosis fugax) (**OR**) ≥ 1 Minor non-disabling ischemic
  stroke - Carotid symptoms occurred within previous 6 months - Vertigo and syncope are **NOT** generally caused by carotid stenosis and hence
  should not be considered as indicative as symptomatic
  ➡Asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease
- Presence of atherosclerotic narrowing of extracranial internal carotid artery in individuals
  without a history of recent ipsilateral carotid territory ischemic stroke or TIA
- Estimated risk of ipsilateral stroke = 0.5-1.0% annually
  II. Pathophysiology

1. Anatomical correlation
   ➡Surgical anatomy

- CCA divides into ICA and ECA at the level of superior border of thyroid cartilage
  corresponding to C3/4 intervertebral disc space - ICA has no extracranial branches - ECA has multiple branches supplying face and scalp and provide collateral
  circulation to the brain
- MCA is **NOT** considered part of the circle of Willis
- Vagus nerve is located posterior to CCA in majority of individuals (90-95%)
  ➡Carotid baroreceptors
- Stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors that respond to alterations in BP
- Located within the adventitia of the origin of ICA and are innervated by a branch of
  glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)
- Nerve fibers decrease firing rates stimulating sympathetic nervous system and inhibit
  parasympathetic nervous system in response to low BP
- Patient display varying degrees of BP and HR alterations during manipulation of carotid
  bifurcation, carotid clamping or postoperatively after carotid endarterectomy

[Image Description: The number 892 is at the bottom right of the page.]

[Detailed illustration of the human arterial system, focusing on the head, neck, and upper chest. The aorta is shown at the bottom, branching into the brachiocephalic trunk and the subclavian arteries. The carotid arteries ascend on either side of the neck, branching into the internal and external carotid arteries. Several smaller arteries branch off, including the vertebral, thyroid, and cervical arteries. In the head, the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries are labeled, along with other smaller arteries like the ophthalmic, supra-orbital, and lacrimal arteries. Anastomoses, labeled with numbers 1-5, indicate connections between different arteries. The text labels each artery, and a key at the bottom right lists the anastomoses.]

III. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡Cardiovascular examination

- Carotid bruit
  - Typically heard over origin of ICA when stenosis ≥ 70%
  - Poor predictor of the degree of stenosis and patients with total carotid artery occlusion does not give any bruit at all
    ➡Ophthalmological examination
- Partial or complete blindness in one eye
  - Ocular ischemia ipsilateral to the side of occlusion
- Absence of pupillary light response
  - Ocular ischemia ipsilateral to the side of occlusion
- Fundoscopic examination
  - Demonstrate retinal arterial occlusion and ischemic changes
    ➡CNS examination
- Demonstrate signs and symptoms of cerebral hemisphere ischemia
- Cortical signs = Aphasia/ Apraxia/ Agnosia/ Neglect/ Homonymous hemianopia
- Left hemisphere = Aphasia
- Right hemisphere = Visuospatial neglect/ Constructional apraxia

894

2. Radiological tests
   ➡Carotid duplex USG

- Detect focal increases in blood flow velocity indicative of high-grade carotid stenosis
- Peak systolic velocity\*, end-diastolic velocity, carotid index (Peak ICA velocity/ CCA velocity) measurement to gauge the severity of the stenosis
- Transcranial doppler USG is commonly used in conjunction with carotid duplex USG to examine major intracerebral arteries through orbit and base of the brain
- Advantages
  - Non-invasive/ Inexpensive/ Safe/ Convenient
  - Accurate in detecting high-grade stenosis
- Disadvantages - Operator-dependent - Less accurate in detecting low-grade stenosis - Not reliable in cases with severe kinking, severe calcification, patients with short neck or high carotid artery bifurcation
  ➡CT angiography (CTA)
- Advantages
  - Provides anatomical depiction of carotid artery lumen and allows imaging of adjacent soft tissues and bony structures
- Disadvantages - Relatively contraindicated in patients with impaired renal function due to contrast administration
  ➡MR angiography (MRA)
- Utilizes either 2D or 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MRA or gadolinium-enhanced MRI
- Advantages
  - Accurate in detecting high-grade stenosis
  - Less operatory-dependent
- Disadvantages - High cost/Time-consuming/Less readily available - Not applicable if patients is severely ill, unable to lie supine, has claustrophobia, pacemaker or ferromagnetic implants
  ➡Cerebral angiography
- GOLD imaging for imaging the carotid arteries and intracranial atherosclerotic disease but rarely performed nowadays
- Indications
  - Suspected non-atherosclerotic disease such as dissection or vasculitis
  - Suspected disease in proximal common carotid artery or the origins of great vessels from the aortic arch
  - Poor quality or discordant results of non-invasive imaging
- Advantages
  - Permits evaluation of entire carotid artery system providing information about tandem atherosclerotic disease, plaque morphology and collateral circulation
- Disadvantages - High cost - Invasive with risk of neurological complication such as stroke - Limited number of projections leading to underestimation of the degree of stenosis if stenosis is asymmetrical instead of concentric
  895

IV. Treatment

1. General approach
   ➡Approach to asymptomatic disease

- Medical therapy ALONE for all patients
- Carotid endarterectomy in SELECTED patients - Medically stable patients who have a life expectancy of ≥ 5 years (AND) - High-grade (≥ 70%) asymptomatic carotid stenosis at baseline (OR) - Progression to ≥ 70% stenosis despite intensive medical therapy
  ➡Approach to symptomatic disease
- Carotid revascularization
  - Carotid endarterectomy
  - Carotid artery angioplasty and stenting

2. General management
   ➡Lifestyle modification

- Weight control
- Mediterranean diet
- Regular aerobic physical activity
- Smoking cessation
- Limited alcohol consumption

3. Medical treatment
   ➡ Statins
   ➡Anti-platelets (i.e. Aspirin)
   ➡ Anti-hypertensive

[Chart of a flow diagram showing the treatment plan for carotid stenosis. The flow diagram starts with "Carotid stenosis" and branches out to different treatment options based on the severity of the stenosis and the patient's symptoms. The main branches are "Medical Management," "Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA)," and "Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS)." Each branch further details specific criteria and considerations for choosing the appropriate treatment.]

896

4. Carotid endarterectomy
   ➡Indications

- **Symptomatic** or **asymptomatic** carotid stenosis of ≥ 70 – 99% and a life expectancy of ≥
  5 year who meet all of the following criteria
  - Surgically accessible carotid lesion
  - No prior ipsilateral endarterectomy
  - Absence of clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary or other disease that would
    greatly increase the risk of anesthesia and surgery
- Overall morbidity and mortality rate associated with carotid endarterectomy should be
  low (< 6% in **symptomatic** patients; < 3% in **asymptomatic** patients)
  ➡Contraindications
- Asymptomatic complete carotid occlusion (**ABSOLUTE contraindicated**)
  - NO surgical treatment has been proven to be of benefit for preventing a
    subsequent stroke in patients with complete carotid artery occlusion
- Surgically inaccessible location (high bifurcation)
- Prior neck irradiation resulting in "woody fibrosis" of skin and subcutaneous tissues
- Prior radical neck dissection with or without irradiation
- Recurrent carotid stenosis despite previous endarterectomy
- Unacceptably high medical risk
  ➡Pre-operative evaluation
- Cardiac evaluation (e.g. exercise testing) due to association with coronary heart disease
- CXR due to association with smoking and coronary heart disease
- Brain CT or MRI to assess degree of cerebral infarction
- Carotid duplex to ascertain the carotid artery is not totally occluded
- Otolaryngologic examination (e.g. laryngoscopy) in patients who have a residual voice
  disturbance after a prior neck surgery
  ➡Pre-operative preparation
- Low dose aspirin
  - Recommended for all patients who are having carotid endarterectomy and should
    be started prior to surgery and continued for at least 3 months after surgery
- Statins
- Antibiotics
  - Prophylactic antibiotics to control surgical site infection due to frequent use of
    prosthetic material
    ➡Anesthesia
- Can be performed using local (regional) anesthesia or general anesthesia
- **Advantages** of LA over GA
  - Associated with fewer alterations in BP since GA reduces BP during anesthesia
    induction and may require the use of pressor agents to manipulate BP
- **Disadvantages** of LA over GA
  - Uncomfortable for patients
  - Urgent conversion to GA may be necessary

897

➡Procedures

- Routine **VS** Selective shunting
  - Cerebral blood flow is assured in routine shunting without the need for neurological monitoring
  - EEG monitoring is required for patients under GA to assess cerebral perfusion during carotid artery clamping if selective shunting is chosen
- Patch angioplasty **VS** Primary closure
  - Carotid artery after removal of plaque can be closed primarily or being patched with saphenous vein or prosthetic material
  - Patch angioplasty is associated with a decrease in frequency of restenosis and lower rate of ipsilateral stroke
    ➡Post-operative care
- BP is maintained between 100 – 150 mmHg to prevent complications related to hypertension (e.g. neck hematoma) or hypotension (e.g. cerebral ischemia)
  - BP lability is common 12 – 24 hours postoperatively
  - Standard of care for patients to be monitored with an arterial line in place
- Duplex doppler USG surveillance
  - Repeat duplex USG 3 – 6 weeks following carotid endarterectomy to obtain baseline and perform surveillance at 6 months and annually
    ➡ Complications
- Stroke
  - Factors contributing to stroke include plaque emboli, improper flushing, poor cerebral protection or relative hypotension
- Hyperperfusion syndrome
  - Small vessel compensate for ischemic changes with chronic maximal dilatation to maintain sufficient cerebral blood flow
  - Blood flow is restored to an elevated perfusion pressure within the previously hypoperfused hemisphere after surgery
  - Dilated vessels are unable to vasoconstrict sufficiently to protect the capillary bed due to loss of cerebral blood flow autoregulation
  - Breakthrough perfusion pressure thus causes hemorrhage and edema
- Myocardial infarction
- Carotid restenosis
  - Occurs in 2 – 10% in 5 years
- Nerve injury (CN 7, 9, 10, 12)
  - Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) is most frequently involved
  - Marginal mandibular branch from facial nerve (CN VII), laryngeal nerve from vagus nerve (CN X), glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) can also be involved
  - Sympathetic nerves can also be injured resulting in Horner's syndrome
- Cervical hematoma
  - Can result in abrupt airway obstruction
- Infection
  - Surgical wound infection and parotitis can occur following manipulation of the parotid gland during the procedure

898

5. Carotid artery angioplasty with stenting
   ➡General features

- Stenting reduces risk of embolization, thrombosis and long-term restenosis
  ➡Indications
- Surgically inaccessible location (high bifurcation)
- Radiation-induced stenosis
- Restenosis after endarterectomy
- Clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary or other disease that greatly increases the risk of anesthesia and surgery
  ➡Contraindications
- Absolute contraindications
  - Active infection
  - Inability to gain vascular access
  - Visible thrombus within the lesion
- Relative contraindications - Age > 80 years old - Severe carotid tortuosity - Near occlusion of carotid artery - Heavily calcified aortic arch - Severe plaque calcification, circumferential carotid plaque
  ➡Pre-operative preparations
- Aspirin and clopidogrel
- Statins
- Antibiotic prophylaxis
  ➡Anesthesia
- Can be performed using local (regional) anesthesia or general anesthesia - Most carotid stenting procedures are performed with LA and minimal sedation
  ➡Procedures
- Percutaneous access is typically obtained via common femoral artery
- Patient should be anticoagulated with heparin before manipulation of guidewires and catheters within the carotid artery
- Placement of embolic protection devise
- Stent placement and dilation - Bradycardia due to baroreceptor activation can occurs and lead to hypotension - Reaction is usually transient and may require administration of atropine
  ➡Post-operative care
- Control of hemodynamic instability
- Duplex doppler USG surveillance
  - Repeat duplex USG 3 - 6 weeks following carotid endarterectomy to obtain baseline and perform surveillance at 6 months and annually

899

- Complications
  - Stroke
    - Short-term periprocedural risk of stroke and death is higher in carotid artery
      stenting than carotid endarterectomy whereas long-term outcomes are similar
    - Result of thromboembolism, hypoperfusion due to bradycardia or baroreceptor
      stimulation, cerebral hyperperfusion, intracerebral hemorrhage
  - Myocardial infarction
  - Hyperperfusion syndrome
    - Small vessel compensate for ischemic changes with chronic maximal dilatation to
      maintain sufficient cerebral blood flow
    - Blood flow is restored to an elevated perfusion pressure within the previously
      hypoperfused hemisphere after surgery
    - Dilated vessels are unable to vasoconstrict sufficiently to protect the capillary bed
      due to loss of cerebral blood flow autoregulation
    - Breakthrough perfusion pressure thus causes hemorrhage and edema
  - Contrast-related complications
    - Contrast-induced nephropathy but renal dysfunction can also be due to renal
      atheroemboli or renal hypoperfusion in patients with hemodynamic instability
  - Access-related complications
    - Bleeding or hematoma
    - Pseudoaneurysm
    - Peripheral embolization
  - Stent-related complications - Stent fracture - Stent restenosis

# Cardiovascular Diseases

## Aortic dissection

I. **Overview**

1. General features
   ➡ Aortic dissection is defined as separation of layers of aortic wall by intimal injury
   - Allows blood to travel between intima and media resulting in creation of two flow channels known as the true lumen and false lumen
     ➡ Ascending aorta dissections are **2x** more common than descending aorta
   - Right lateral wall of ascending aorta is the most common site of aortic dissection
2. Anatomical classification

[Diagram illustrating the anatomical classification of aortic dissection. There are four different aorta diagrams, representing the four types: Type I, Type II, Type IIIa, and Type IIIb. Type I shows a dissection starting in the ascending aorta and extending through the aortic arch and descending aorta. Type II shows a dissection limited to the ascending aorta. Type IIIa depicts a dissection starting in the descending aorta, distal to the subclavian artery. Type IIIb illustrates a dissection involving the thoracic and abdominal aorta, starting distal to the left subclavian artery. Below each diagram is a label: "Type I", "Type II", "Type IIIa", and "Type IIIb". Underneath this row, the labels "DeBakey classification", "Type A", "Stanford classification", and "Type B" are provided.]

➡ Rationale of classification

- **Type A** dissection (60%) is a **life-threatening** surgical emergency requiring emergency repair due to potentially deadly complications including AR, AMI and cardiac tamponade
- **Type B** dissection can usually be managed medically **EXCEPT**
  - Dissection into end-organ vessels leading to ischemia (celiac/ renal/ LL)
  - Concomitant aortic aneurysm which has a higher risk of rupture

| DeBakey classification |                                                                                                                 | Stanford classification |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type I**             | ➡ Involves ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta ➡ May progress to involve abdominal aorta | **Type A**              | ➡ Involves ascending aorta ➡ May progress to involve the aortic arch and thoracic and abdominal aorta Note: "A" for ascending |

Acute dissection Intramural hematoma Penetrating ulcers

=> Overview

- Acute aortic syndrome involves a spectrum of life-threatening aortic conditions
- Includes the classical aortic dissection (AD) which is defined as separation of the layers of aortic wall due to an intimal tear
- Encompasses other variants including intramural hematoma, penetrating aortic ulcers, intimal tear without hematoma and periaortic hematoma
  => Aortic intramural hematoma
- Accounts for 5-20% of patients with symptoms consistent with aortic dissection
- Focal hematoma confined between intima and media layer due to spontaneous rupture of vasa vasorum in the ABSENCE of a detectable intimal tear or dissection flap due to hypertension, trauma or iatrogenic injuries
- Classified similar to aortic dissection - Involves ascending aorta: Managed surgically - Does not involve ascending aorta: Managed medically unless hematoma > 1cm thick (9x higher progression), aortic diameter > 4 cm (30x higher progression) or progression on serial imaging
  => Penetrating aortic ulcers
- Aortic ulcers penetrating into adventitia with surrounding hematoma that is usually subadventitial
- Aortic intima is denuded (clearly break) with the lesion progressing through a variable amount of aortic wall
- Typically associated with atherosclerotic changes of adjacent aortic wall and smoking
- Can lead to aortic dissection or perforation
- Classified and treated similar to intramural hematoma
  => Limited intimal tear without hematoma
- Characterized by a stellate or linear intimal tear associated with exposure of underlying aortic media or adventitia

902

II. Etiology

1. Risk factors
   ➡HT (**most important**)
   ➡Collagen disorders

- Marfan syndrome
- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
  ➡Aortic aneurysm
  ➡Bicuspid aortic valve
  ➡Family history of aortic dissection

III. Pathogenesis

1. Pathophysiology
   ➡Tear in aortic intima layer and blood passes into aortic media
   ➡Creates a false lumen as it separates intima from surrounding media and adventitia
   ➡False lumen dilation and true lumen collapse immediately following dissection

- False lumen dilation depends on BP, size of entry tear, depth of dissection plane within media and percentage of aortic circumference involved
- True lumen collapses due to pressure differential between true and false lumen and can be exacerbated by intrinsic recoil of muscular elements within dissection flap
  ➡Leads to an increase in aortic cross-sectional area

IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Acute pain

- **Site**: Anterior chest (Type A)/ Back or abdomen (Type B)
- **Onset**: Abrupt onset
- **Character**: Sharp, tearing and knife-life
- **Radiation**: Radiates anywhere in thorax or abdomen
  ➡Pulse deficit
- Weak or absent carotid, brachial or femoral pulse
- Impaired or absence of blood flow to peripheral vessels result from intimal flap or compression by hematoma
  ➡Hypertension (Type A: 25 – 35%; Type B: 70%)
  ➡Hypotension (Type A: 25%; Type B: 5%) and syncope
- Aortic regurgitation
- Cardiac tamponade
- Acute myocardial infarction
- Hemothorax or hemoperitoneum

2. Presentation of complications
   ➡Early diastolic decrescendo murmur with wide pulse pressure

- Aortic regurgitation (AR)
  ➡Focal neurological deficits
- Result from propagation of dissection involving brachial arteries or mass effect of expanding aorta compressing on surrounding structures
- Presentation - Paraplegia (spinal cord) - Altered level of consciousness (carotid artery) - Horner's syndrome (superior cervical ganglion) - Hoarseness (left recurrent laryngeal nerve)
  [Image Description: The image is a white page with black, red, and magenta text. The text is an outline of clinical information regarding etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, signs and symptoms, and presentation of complications.]

3. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Pneumothorax
   ➡ Pulmonary embolism
   ➡ Pericarditis
   ➡ Acute pancreatitis
   ➡ Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)

V. Diagnosis

1. Biochemical test
   ➡ Cardiac enzymes \* cTnT, cTnI, CK-MB

2. Radiological tests
   ➡ Chest X-ray (CXR)
   _ Differentiate aortic dissection from pneumothorax
   _ Radiological findings
   _ Irregular or wavy aortic outline
   _ Widening of aortic silhouette
   _ Widening of mediastinum (erect PA = 6 cm and supine AP = 8 cm) (unable to see the aortic knuckle and descending aorta
   ➡ ECG
   _ Differentiate aortic dissection from AMI
   ➡ Echocardiogram \* Look for aortic regurgitation, pericardial effusion and presence of dissection flap

[Image Description: This image contains two CT scan images, one showing a focal aortic dissection on a CT scan and the other showing a thoracic aortic dissection on computed tomography. The left image shows a cross-sectional view of the abdomen, with a clear aortic dissection marked with a yellow arrow. There are some yellow asterisks on the image. The right image shows a cross-sectional view of the thorax, with the ascending aorta (AA) and descending aorta (DA) clearly visible, and the dissection is also highlighted. The left and right sides of the patient are labelled R and L respectively]

➡ CT angiography (CTA)
_ Indicated in hemodynamically stable patients
_ Diagnosis is made by identification of true and false lumens whereas intimal dissection flap may or may not be demonstrated
_ Compressed true lumen is the key radiological finding
_ True lumen is usually smaller \* False lumen is usually larger

# Aortic dissection on noninvasive imaging

[Image Description: There are two ultrasound images, labeled A and B, showing aortic dissection. Image A displays the layers of the aorta, with labels indicating 'Intimal Flap', 'TL', and 'FL'. Image B also shows the layers of the aorta, along with labels indicating 'Intimal Flap', 'TL', 'FL' and thrombi.]

➡Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)

- Indicated in hemodynamically unstable patients or patient with renal failure who cannot tolerate contrast
- Identification of
  - Intimal dissection flaps
  - True and false lumens
  - Thrombus in false lumen
  - Aortic regurgitation
  - Pericardial effusion

➡ Remarks

- MRI (MR angiography) is **NOT** performed since it is time-consuming and most life-supportive equipment are not MRI-compatible but can be used in long-term FU
- Aortography is rarely performed unless in situations where there is high clinical suspicion of aortic dissection but non-invasive imaging remains inconclusive

905

VI. **Treatment**

1. General management
   ➡ Book coronary care unit (CCU) or intensive care unit (ICU) bed - Monitoring by ECG - Monitoring of BP, pulse, input and output
   ➡ Complete bed rest
   ➡ Nil per oral (NPO) with IV line
   ➡ Morphine as analgesics

2. Medical treatment
   ➡ Sodium nitroprusside (IV) - Vasodilator to decrease BP - Significance - Maintain systolic BP to 100 – 120 mmHg - The **higher** the BP the **more** the blood going into false lumen and the **more**
   extensive the dissection
   ➡ Labetalol (IV) - β-blocker to decrease HR - Significance - Maintain HR at 60 – 70/min

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Indications - Type A: **ALL** patients - Type B: Complicated cases - Type B dissection is classified as complicated or uncomplicated depending on
   evidence of malperfusion of end-organs - Complicated Type B: Aimed at revascularization of affected segment - Uncomplicated Type B: Managed medically including β-blockade and long-term
   antihypertensives - Uncomplicated Type B dissection may progress to become complicated
   and up to 25% require intervention within 4 years
   ➡ Open repair - Excision of intimal tear - Obliteration of entry into false lumen - Reconstitution of aorta by interposition of a synthetic vascular graft - Repair or replacement of aortic valve
   ➡ Endovascular repair - Endovascular stent-grafting

906

VII. **Complications**

1. Complications of aortic dissection
   ➡ _Type A_ - Dissection in aortic valvular annulus → Aortic regurgitation - Dissection into pericardium → Cardiac tamponade - Dissection in coronary artery ostia → Myocardial infarction - Focal neurological deficits related to cerebrovascular ischemia

VIII. **Prognosis**

1. Prognosis of aortic dissections
   ➡ Mortality of Type B dissections - 10% at 30 days - 25% at 3 years - 50% at 5 years

[Image Description: This is a page from a medical document outlining complications and prognosis of aortic dissection. Section VII discusses complications, listing Type A and Type B dissections with their respective sequelae such as aortic regurgitation, cardiac tamponade, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular ischemia, and ischemia in celiac/renal/lower limb.]

# Vascular Diseases

## Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)

I. Overview

1. General features

[Image Description: Four diagrams illustrating different types of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Each diagram shows the aorta and its major branches in red, with an aneurysm (ballooning) at a different location along the aorta. From left to right, the aneurysms are located: above the renal arteries (Suprarenal AAA), between the renal arteries and the iliac bifurcation (Pararenal AAA), immediately below the renal arteries (Juxtarenal AAA), and below the renal arteries (Infrarenal AAA). Labels above each diagram identify the type of AAA: "Suprarenal AAA," "Pararenal AAA," "Juxtarenal AAA," and "Infrarenal AAA".]

➡ Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common true arterial aneurysm

- True aneurysm is defined as a segmental, full-thickness (intima, media and adventitia) dilation of a blood vessel that is > 50% greater than the normal aortic diameter (i.e. 3 cm)
- Rapidly expanding = > 1.0 cm/ year
  ➡ Different size of aneurysm
- Normal aortic diameter = 2.0 cm
- Aortic diameter > 3.0 cm is considered aneurysmal - Small aneurysm: Diameter < 4.0 cm - Medium aneurysm: Diameter = 4.0 cm – 5.5 cm - Large aneurysm: Diameter > 5.5 cm - Very large aneurysm: Diameter ≥ 6.0 cm
  ➡ Different location of aneurysm
- **Suprarenal AAA**: Aneurysm originates above renal arteries
- **Pararenal AAA**: Aneurysm originates from an aneurysmal aorta (i.e. involves aorta at the level of renal arteries)
- **Juxtarenal AAA**: Aneurysm originates at level of renal arteries but aorta at the level of renal arteries is normal
- **Infrarenal AAA** (most common) (85%): Aneurysm originates below renal arteries
  ➡ Association with peripheral aneurysms
- 14% of patients with AAA is associated with peripheral aneurysm such as femoral or popliteal aneurysm
- 62% of patients with popliteal aneurysm has an associated AAA → Screening required
- 82% of patients with femoral aneurysm has an associated AAA → Screening required

II. Etiology
1.↑↑ Risk of AAA
➡ Elderly + Caucasian + Male
➡ Smoking
➡Atherosclerosis
➡ Hypertension
➡Family history of AAA
➡Presence of large artery aneurysm

- Iliac artery aneurysm
- Femoral aneurysm
- Popliteal aneurysm

2. ↑ Risk of AAA
   ➡ Non-Caucasian females
   ➡ Diabetes

III. Pathogenesis

1. Pathophysiology of aneurysmal degeneration
   ➡Majority (90%) of AAA are degenerative in origin and the remaining are inflammatory (5%) and
   idiopathic
   ➡Alterations in vascular wall biology leading to progressive thinning and weakening of aortic wall
   and enlargement of aortic diameter

- Transmural inflammatory changes
- Abnormal collagen remodelling and cross-linking
- Loss of elastin and smooth muscle cells

[Image of the number 909 in the bottom right corner of the page.]

IV. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Non-ruptured AAA (75%)
   ➡ Abdominal, back, flank or pelvic pain

- Rapid expansion of aneurysm
- Rupture of aneurysm
- Compression or erosion of aneurysm into surrounding structures such as spine
- Infection or inflammation of aortic wall by an infected or inflamed aneurysm
  ➡ Limb ischemia
- Presentation varies from acute painful blue digits (blue toe syndrome), painful pulseless cool extremity or claudication
- Thrombus builds up gradually along the wall as aorta expands over time
- Embolism of thrombus or atherosclerotic debris from aneurysm
  ➡ Constitutional symptoms (infected or inflammatory aneurysm/ DIC)
- Fever
- Malaise
- Weight loss
- Nausea
- Syncope

2. Ruptured AAA
   ➡ Hypotension
   ➡ Abdominal distension
   ➡ Abdominal pain (_severe and acute_)

- Proximal aortic rupture near renal arteries
  Ο Back or flank pain
- Distal aortic rupture near iliac bifurcation
  • Abdominal or pelvic pain
  Ο Radiates to groin or thigh due to lumbar nerve irritation
- Anterior aortic wall rupture
  Ο Abdominal pain progress as rupture progresses quickly to free intraperitoneal rupture with hemodynamic instability
- Posterior aortic wall rupture
  Ο Severe focal pain due to retroperitoneal hematoma
  Ο Subsidization of pain after hematoma stabilizes

3. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Aortic dissection
   ➡ Ulcerated aortic plaque
   ➡ Acute pancreatitis
   ➡ Acute peritonitis
   ➡ Acute myocardial infarction (MI)

910

V. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡General examination

- Vital signs
  - Fever
  - Tachycardia
  - Hypotension
- Ecchymosis
  - Extensive retroperitoneal hematoma from ruptured AAA may lead to extravasation of blood into subcutaneous tissues
  - Grey-Turner sign: Flank ecchymosis
  - Cullen's sign: Periumbilical ecchymosis
  - Fox's sign: Proximal thigh ecchymosis
  - Bryant's sign: Discoloration of scrotum

Note: Ecchymosis of these sites include acute pancreatitis, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, ruptured HCC and perinephric hematoma
➡Abdominal examination (Aortic bifurcation = Umbilicus - L3/4 level)

- Expansile pulsatile mass
- Abdominal distension
- Abdominal tenderness
  ➡Vascular examination
- Other peripheral artery aneurysms
  - Femoral aneurysm
  - Popliteal aneurysm
- Evidence of distal embolization and ischemia

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Anemia
  - Hypochromic microcytic anemia due to acute blood loss
- Leukocytosis - Infected or inflamed aneurysm
  ➡Clotting profile
- Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) - ↑ (Prolongation) of PT, APТТ, ТТ - Coagulation inhibitor (e.g. anti-thrombin) - ↓Platelet count - ↓ Fibrinogen level from consumption of coagulation factors and platelets - ↑ Fibrin degradation products especially D-Dimers (Clot lysis indicator)
  ➡Inflammatory markers
- ↑ ESR and CRP - Infected or inflamed aneurysm
  ➡Arterial blood gas (ABG)
- Metabolic acidosis - Acute blood loss leading to shock
  [Image of the number 911 on the bottom right of the page]

3.  Radiological tests
    USG abdomen
    - Initial diagnostic modality in asymptomatic patients suspected of AAA based on history and clinical examination or incidental findings
    - Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exam is also indicated in hemodynamically unstable patients with suspected AAA
    - Non-invasive inexpensive way to diagnose AAA with high sensitivity and specificity
    - Fasting is required to reduce the presence of overlying bowel gas that obscure aorta

    CT angiography (CTA)
    - Indicated in symptomatic patients with suspected AAA
    - Differentiate ruptured from non-ruptured aneurysm and define the extent of aneurysm to provide information for planning of urgent AAA or EVAR repair
      - Patients who are unstable should be AAA

    MR angiography (MRA)
    - Comparable to CT but avoids radiation exposure and is useful in patients with IV contrast contraindications

VI. Treatment

1.  General principles
    Non-operative management
    - Monitoring with USG/ CTA yearly
    - Lifestyle modification
      - Smoking cessation
      - Control of hypertension
      - Exercise
      - Treatment of COPD

    Indications for surgery of uncomplicated AAA
    - Symptomatic aneurysm of any size
    - ALL AAA > 5 cm (5.5 cm in Caucasians)
      - Should be operated on unless patient is medically unfit or limited life expectancy
        - Medically unfit refers to operative mortality higher than risk of rupture
    - Rapidly expanding AAA > 1.0 cm/ year or > 0.5 cm/ 6 months
    - Saccular aneurysm

    Different types of surgical treatment
    - Open surgical repair
    - Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)

    Management of ruptured AAA
    - IV fluid resuscitation (crystalloids/ colloids/ blood) to maintain organ perfusion
      - Allows permissive hypotension (SBP < 100 mmHg)
      - AVOID over-resuscitation due to associated dilution of clotting factors, destabilization of thrombus and hemorrhage
    - EVAR approach is **preferred** over open surgery for the initial approach for ruptured AAA

912

2. Surgical treatment (Open surgical AAA repair)
   ➡Replacement of diseased aortic segment with a tube or bifurcated prosthetic graft
   ➡Transabdominal or retroperitoneal approach

- Transabdominal: Midline abdominal incision
- Retroperitoneal: Left retroperitoneal incision - Advantageous in patients with previous intraabdominal surgery, obese patients, COPD patients - Proximal suprarenal or supraceliac control of aorta is more easily achieved by retroperitoneal approach
  ➡ Complications
- CVS: Arrhythmia/ AMI
- Vascular: Intraoperative hemorrhage/ LL ischemia/ Distal embolization/ Aortoduodenal fistula
  - LL ischemia may result from embolism or thrombosis which can be prevented by minimizing manipulation of aneurysm prior to clamping + Use of Fogarty balloon catheters to remove distal emboli when leg ischemia is identified in operating theatre
  - Distal embolization with microemboli arising from atherosclerotic debris can cause cutaneous ischemia (trash foot) which is usually treated expectantly as long as major vessels are patent but amputation may be required if significant necrosis results
- UG: Acute renal failure/ Sexual dysfunction
  - Related to use of IV contrast, inadequate hydration, hypotension or renal ischemia from a period of aortic clamping above renal arteries or embolization to renal arteries
  - Sexual dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation resulting from damage to sympathetic plexus during dissection near the proximal left common iliac artery
- CNS: Paraplegia
  - Result of spinal cord ischemia
- GI: Bowel ischemia/ Prolonged paralytic ileus
  - Ischemic colitis related to ligation of IMA in the absence of adequate collateral circulation
  - Presents with postoperative fever, leukocytosis and peritonitis
  - Necrosis limited to mucosa can be treated expectantly with IV antibiotics and bowel rest
  - Necrosis of muscularis propria causes segmental strictures which may require delayed segmental resection
  - Transmural necrosis requires immediate resection of necrotic colon and end colostomy
- Infection: Wound infection/ Graft infection

913

3. Surgical treatment (Endovascular repair (EVAR))
   ➡Placement of modular graft components delivered via the iliac or femoral arteries to line the aorta
   and exclude the aneurysm sac from the circulation
   ➡Lifelong surveillance is required to assure integrity of the repair

- Close FU with CT scan every 6 months for 1 year and then yearly is essential to maintain
  long-term clinical success with this technique
  ➡ MOST important selection criteria for EVAR is an appropriate aortoiliac anatomy
  ➡Preoperative CT assessment is required to determine whether EVAR is suitable
- Aortic neck diameter: Aortic diameter at the lowest renal artery - Required endograft diameter is calculated by adding an additional 15 - 20% of
  aortic neck diameter to provide sufficient radial force to prevent device migration - Commercially available devices have endograft diameter largest at 36 mm which
  allows EVAR to a maximal aortic neck diameter of 32 mm - Undersizing will lead to inadequate seal and failure to exclude the aneurysm - Oversizing will lead to incomplete expansion of endograft with infolding and
  inadequate seal, kinging of device which can form a nidus for thrombus formation
  or can also lead to endoleak
- Aortic neck length: Distance from lowest renal artery to the origin of aneurysm - Ideally should be at least 10-15 mm to provide an adequate proximal landing
  zone for endograft fixation
- Aortic neck angulation: Angle formed between points connecting the lowest renal artery,
  origin of aneurysm and aortic bifurcation - Ideally should be < 60° since angles that are greater will lead to difficulties in
  implantation, kinking, endoleak and potential for distal device migration
- Cone-shaped neck/Reverse tapered aortic neck: Dimeter of aorta 15 mm below the
  lowest renal artery is ≥ 10% larger than diameter of aorta at lowest renal artery - Cone-shaped/ Reversed tapered neck (i.e. widens more distally) may preclude
  adequate apposition of endograft to aortic wall
- Iliac artery and access vessel morphology - Iliac arteries should have a minimal amount of tortuosity and calcification and no
  significant stenosis or mural thrombus present in the distal graft landing zones
  ➡ Advantages of EVAR compared to open surgery
- Reduces perioperative morbidity and mortality
  - Since it does not require operative exposure of aorta or aortic clamping
- Shorter duration of hospitalization
  ➡ Complications
- Related to systemic complications
  - Vascular injury (e.g. iliac or femoral artery)
    - Especially iliac artery avulsion at iliac bifurcation
  - Arterial dissection
    - Additional stent may be necessary to treat the dissected vessel
  - Bowel ischemia
    - Secondary to embolization or hypoperfusion
  - Acute renal failure
    - Secondary to embolization or renal artery occlusion
    - Nephrotoxicity due to contrast-induced nephropathy
- Complications related to endografts - Endoleaks\* (Type I and III NOT acceptable) - Defined as failure to exclude the aneurysmal sac from arterial blood flow
  potentially predisposing to rupture - Graft infection/ thrombosis/ migration

914

[A diagram illustrates various types of endoleaks associated with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The central focus is an anatomical representation of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries, featuring a stent graft deployed within the aorta to reinforce a weakened area or aneurysm. Several arrows, each labeled with a different "Type," point to different locations where endoleaks can occur.

- Type Ia, indicated by a red arrow, points to the proximal attachment site of the stent graft, near the renal arteries.
- Type Ib, also marked in red, indicates the distal attachment site of the stent graft, near the iliac arteries.
- Type II, shown with a yellow arrow, points to the aneurysm sac, suggesting backflow from lumbar or inferior mesenteric arteries.
- Type III, represented by a green arrow, highlights a defect in the graft fabric or a disconnection between graft components.
- Type IV, illustrated with a blue arrow, points to the porous graft fabric, indicating leakage through the material itself.]

VII. Prognosis

1. Complications
   ➡ Rupture of aneurysm

- Intraperitoneal (Free)
- Retroperitoneal → Retroperitoneal hematoma
- Duodenum (Aortoduodenal fistula) → GI bleeding
- Inferior vena cava (Aortocaval fistula) → Heart failure
  ➡Thrombosis and embolism
  ➡ Infection and inflammation
  ➡Pressure effects

2. Risk of rupture at 5 years
   ➡Aneurysm < 5 cm = 20%
   ➡ Aneurysm > 5 cm = 50%

# Vascular Diseases

## Acute arterial insufficiency

I. **Overview**

1. General features
   - Acute arterial insufficiency = Acute arterial ischemia = Acute arterial occlusion
   - Defined as a sudden decrease in limb perfusion that causes a potential threat to the limb viability in patient who present within **2 weeks** of the acute event
   - Irreversible damage occurs 4 - 6 hours after onset if adequate collateral circulation is absent
     - Skeletal muscles can only withstand up to 6 hours of ischemia
     - Patients with pre-existing peripheral vascular disease can tolerate longer due to establishment of collaterals
   - Acute arterial insufficiency is commonly caused by embolism, thrombosis and trauma
   - Clinically manifests as ischemic rest pain or development to tissue loss such as ischemic ulcers and gangrene

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Acute extremities compartment syndrome

- Can cause extrinsic compression of arteries leading to ischemic symptoms
  ➡Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with superficial vein thrombosis - Known as phlegmasia cerulea dolens (i.e. = painful blue edema) - Venous pressure is increased to an extent that extremity perfusion is impaired

IV. Clinical manifestation

1. 6Ps Mnemonics
   ➡ **_Pain_** - Early signs of ischemia that develops acutely - Tissue sensitivity to ischemia = Nerves > Muscle > Skin > Bone - Begins distally in extremity and progresses proximally - Gradually increases in severity with time - Gradually decreases in severity subsequently - Due to ischemic sensory loss when nerves die from ischemia
   ➡***Paraesthesia*** - Early signs of ischemia that develops acutely - Tissue sensitivity to ischemia = Nerves > Muscle > Skin > Bone - Begins with paraesthesia and progresses to complete sensory loss - Light touch > Vibration > Proprioception > Deep pain > Pressure
   ➡***Pallor*** - Can still be pink in color but will be marble white in severe ischemia - Discoloration usually affect a large part of distal limbs - Site of arterial occlusion is usually one joint above line of demarcation between normal and ischemic tissues - Other colours - Mottling (patches of blue on white): Deoxygenation of stagnated blood (blue) and vasoconstriction of surrounding areas (white) - Duskiness: Deoxygenation of stagnated blood (blue) and fixed staining of color that does NOT blanch on pressure indicates the limb is not viable - Black: Gangrene formation
   ➡***Pulseless*** - Normal pulse in contralateral limb → Acute arterial ischemia → Arterial emboli - Pulse deficit in contralateral limb → Chronic arterial ischemia → Arterial thrombus - Handheld Doppler can be used to assess arterial and venous flow in limb even if the pulse is not palpable as there can still be flow without palpable pulse
   ➡***Perishingly cold***
   ➡***Paralyzed*** - Late signs of ischemia and indicates irreversible ischemia - Tissue sensitivity to ischemia = Nerves > Muscle > Skin > Bone - Indicates the limb is non-viable and is a poor prognostic sign - Assess viability of muscles by making surgical incision - Viable muscles appears shiny in appearance and twitches in response to flicking - Non-viable muscles appears dull in appearance and does not respond to flicking - Dangerous to save ischemic dead muscles since reperfusion can cause systemic circulation of toxic metabolites

4. Physical examination
   ➡ Ankle-brachial index (ABI)

- Resting systolic ankle BP (posterior tibial/ dorsalis pedis whichever is higher) is divided by systolic brachial BP (left/right arm whichever is higher)
  - Ankle pressure: Measured with BP cuff around the calf and the Doppler probe at the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial arteries
  - Brachial pressure: Measured with BP cuff around the arm and Doppler probe at brachial artery and the cuff is inflated until arterial signal is obliterated and slow deflate until signal just starts being detected at which the pressure is recorded
- Provides a measure of severity of disease and confirm clinical suspicion of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease

| ABI         | Interpretation                                                                                 |

|             | - Arterial obstruction associated with claudication                                            |
| < 0.4       | ➡ Critical limb ischemia                                                                       |
|             | - Arterial obstruction associated with ischemic rest pain, non-healing ulceration and gangrene |

- Exercise treadmill test
  - Indicated in patients with classical history of intermittent claudication or atypical extremity pain but normal ABI at rest
  - Measurement of ABI before and after patient exercise on treadmill and a ABI decrease of 0.2 indicates claudication
    ➡ Vascular examination
- Palpation of peripheral pulses
  - **Upper extremities**: Carotid/ Subclavian/ Axillary/ Brachial/ Radial/ Ulnar
  - **Lower extremities**: Femoral/ Popliteal/ Posterior tibial/ Dorsalis pedis
- Temperature, color, capillary refill
  - Cool/ Pale/ Delayed capillary refill
- Trophic changes
  - Loss of hair/ Dry, shiny and atrophy (thinning) of skin/ Brittle, ridged, hypertrophy (thickening) of nails/ Pointed toes
- Buerger test
  - Elevation of foot with the patient lying supine until the veins are completely drained and then place the foot in dependent position
  - Normal: Remains pink on elevation
  - Ischemia: Pallor → Dusky flush spreading proximally from toes (rubrous or cyanotic color)
    ➡ Neurological examination
- Signs of early nerve dysfunction
  - Numbness or paraesthesia
- Signs of advanced nerve dysfunction
  - Motor loss

922

5. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials
   ➡ Clotting profile
   ⇨ RFT

- Aware of contrast nephropathy
  ➡ Arterial blood gas (ABG)
- Look for lactic acidosis
  ➡ Serum CK level
- Evaluation of rhabdomyolysis
  ➡ Cardiac enzymes
- Indicated if suspecting an AMI with left ventricular mural thrombus

6. Radiological tests
   ➡ Duplex ultrasound

- Duplex USG = 2D USG + Doppler technique
- Locate the level of obstruction
- Classify severity of acute arterial ischemia based on Doppler findings
- Normal arterial flow waveform should be triphasic and either monophasic or biphasic waveform are abnormal
  ➡ Computed tomographic angiography (CTA)
- NO significant difference in accuracy between CTA and MRA
- Diagnose the location and severity of arterial stenosis or occlusion
  ➡ Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)
- Avoid exposure to ionizing radiation and minimal risk of contrast nephropathy
- Diagnose the location and severity of arterial stenosis or occlusion
  ➡ Catheter-based digital subtraction arteriography (DSA)
- Indicated only in patients with planned intervention such as angioplasty and stenting
- Digital subtraction removes underlying bone from the images so as to better visualize the arteries and is considered gold standard for evaluation of arterial tree before planning of revascularization
- Invasive technique and is associated with - Risk of contrast or drug allergy - Risk of bleeding from arterial puncture, worsening of ischemia due to arterial dissection or damage, hematoma formation and local infection
  ➡ Adjuncts
- ECG to look for underlying cardiac arrhythmia and AMI
- Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiogram to look for cardiac emboli source
- CXR to look for widened mediastinum indicating aortic dissection

923

VI. **Management**

1. Supportive treatment
   ➡ Measures to improve existing perfusion

- Keep the feet dependent
- O2 supplementation to maximize tissue oxygenation
- Correction of hypotension since it can precipitate acute thrombosis by low flow (stasis)

2. Medical treatment
   ➡ Analgesics
   ➡Anticoagulants\*

- **ALL** patients should be anticoagulated once the diagnosis of acute artery ischemia due to emboli or thrombi is made in the absence of contraindications
- IV heparin bolus followed by continuous heparin infusion
- Aims for APTT 2-2.5x of normal value
- Rationale of early anticoagulation - Prevents further propagation of thrombus into unaffected vascular bed - Inhibits thrombosis distally in arterial and venous systems due to low flow (stasis)
  924

3. Surgical treatment

|                 | ➡ ± Prophylactic fasciotomy                 |                                                                                                    |
|                 | - For compartment syndrome                  |                                                                                                    |
| **Indications** | ➡ Immediately threatened extremities        | ➡ Viable or marginally threatened extremities                                                      |
|                 | ➡ Recent occlusion < 2 weeks                | ➡ Prolonged occlusion > 2 weeks                                                                    |
|                 |                                             | - Preferred in diseased vessels since it can be difficult to trawl out a clot in a stenosed vessel |

4. Surgical revascularization: Embolectomy ± Fasciotomy
   ➡ Embolectomy

- Involves clamping of the involved artery and making an arterotomy
- Fogarty balloon embolectomy catheter is inserted into artery until distal to the clot
- Balloon is inflated to trawl the clot out of the artery
- Flush with heparinized normal saline
- Closure of arterotomy with meticulous hemostasis
- Intraoperative angiography is advisable to ascertain the adequacy of clot removal and document distal patency
  ➡ Fasciotomy
- Fasciotomy should be routinely considered in any patient with > 6 hours of acute limb ischemia or in the presence of combined arterial and venous injuries
  ➡ Post-operative management
- Conversion to full warfarin anticoagulation by up-titrating the dose until INR = 2-2.5 before heparin is stopped

925

5. Endovascular revascularization: IA Thrombolysis + Angioplasty and stenting
   ➡Potential to reduce morbidity and mortality while achieving limb salvage makes thrombolysis
   preferable to open surgery as 1st line treatment in patients with acute limb ischemia (ALI)
   ➡ Procedures

- Angiography is performed before thrombolysis to locate occlusion and after thrombolysis
  to check for residual clot
- Intra-arterial (IA) catheter directed thrombolysis with thrombolysis catheter inserted into
  the clot
- Thrombolytic agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (e.g.
  alteplase/ reteplase) is infused
- Balloon angioplasty and stenting
  - Can be performed after complete lysis of the clot
    ➡Advantages
- More gradual and complete clot lysis in branch vessels too small to access by
  embolectomy balloons
- More gradual clot dissolution with thrombolysis decreases incidence of reperfusion
  syndrome that is encountered after open surgical procedures where rapid return of blood
  flow may precipitate compartment syndrome
  ➡Disadvantages
- Higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke and major hemorrhage
  Contraindications
- Cerebrovascular accident within past 2 months
- Intracranial hemorrhage within past 3 months
- Intracranial malignancy or brain metastasis
- Active bleeding within past 10 days
- Major surgery or trauma past 10 days
- Uncontrolled hypertension

6. Amputation
   ➡ Indicated for non-viable extremities
   ➡Arteriography is **NOT** necessary since level of amputation is determined by clinical findings and
   by viability of tissues at time of surgery
   ➡Delays in amputation of a non-viable extremities can result in infection, myoglobinuria, acute
   renal failure and hyperkalemia

926

VII. **Complications**

1. **Complications due to ischemia**
   ➡ Compartment syndrome

- Result of prolonged ischemia when cell membrane is damaged and fluid is leaked out into interstitial space in the muscle which are enclosed within a non-distensible fascial envelop
  ➡Rhabdomyolysis (± Cardiac arrhythmia/ Acute kidney injury (AKI))
- Characterized by muscle necrosis and release of intracellular muscle constituents including CK, myoglobin and K+ into systemic circulation
- Hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmia
- Myoglobinuria can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) by acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
  - Aggressive hydration, diuresis with mannitol and IV infusion of bicarbonate to alkalinize the urine

2. **Complications due to revascularization**
   ➡ Stroke and hemorrhage

- Patients treated with endovascular procedures (thrombolysis) is associated with a higher risk of stroke and major hemorrhage including GI bleeding and hematoma at vascular puncture site
- Reperfusion injury
  - Results from formation of oxygen-free radicals that directly damage the tissue and cause WBC accumulation and sequestration in microcirculation
  - Prolongs ischemic interval since it impairs adequate nutrient flow to the tissue despite restoration of axial blood flow
    ➡ Compartment syndrome
  - Ischemic-reperfusion injury
    - Post-ischemic compartment syndrome occurs after revascularization procedures
    - Muscle deprived of arterial blood flow becomes ischemic
    - Formation of oxygen free radicals that damage the capillary walls
    - Increased vascular permeability upon reperfusion leading to localized swelling and edema which increases the compartment pressure
  - Anterior compartment is most commonly affected whereas involvement of posterior compartment is the most functionally devastating
  - Presents with excessive pain in the compartment, pain on passive stretching compartment and sensory loss due to nerve compression that course through the compartment - Numbness in the web space between first and second toes is suggestive due to compression of deep peroneal nerve in anterior compartment
    ➡Rhabdomyolysis (± Cardiac arrhythmia/ Acute kidney injury (AKI))
- Rhabdomyolysis following reperfusion releases by-products of ischemic muscles including CK, myoglobin and K+ into systemic circulation
- Hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmia
- Myoglobinuria can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) by acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
  - Aggressive hydration, diuresis with mannitol and IV infusion of bicarbonate to alkalinize the urine

# Vascular Diseases

## Chronic arterial insufficiency

I. **Overview**

1. General features
   - Defined as decrease in limb perfusion that causes a potential threat to the limb viability in patient who present more than 2 weeks of the acute event
   - Chronic arterial insufficiency is commonly caused by atherosclerosis, vasculitis and entrapment
   - Divided into critical and non-critical limb ischemia
     - Critical limb ischemia (CLI) manifests as rest pain, ischemic ulcers or gangrene
     - Non-critical limb ischemia manifests as intermittent claudication
2. Symptom classification of chronic extremity ischemia
   - Fontaine classification
     - Stage 1 = No symptoms
     - Stage 2 (mild claudication) = Intermittent claudication subdivided into
       - Stage 2a = Without pain on resting and with claudication distance > 200m
       - Stage 2b = Without pain on resting and with claudication distance > 200m
     - Stage 3 (moderate to severe claudication) = Ischemic rest pain or nocturnal
     - Stage 4 = Ulceration (necrosis/ death of tissues) or gangrene

II. **Pathophysiology**

1. Anatomy of lower limb arterial system

[Image of anterior view of the lower limb arterial system. The image shows the path of the arteries from the external iliac down to the dorsalis pedis and dorsal arch in the foot. Key arteries labeled include the common iliac, internal iliac, lateral sacral, internal pudendal, obturator, femoral, genicular, popliteal, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and fibular. The inguinal ligament, deep femoral, and lateral femoral circumflex are also labeled.]

[Image of posterior view of the lower limb arterial system. The arteries from the right external iliac down to the lateral plantar, medial plantar, and plantar arch in the foot are displayed. The deep femoral, lateral femoral circumflex, femoral, genicular, popliteal, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, fibular and peroneal arteries are labeled.]

928

III. Etiology

1. Risk factors
   ➡ Age > 65
   ➡ Hypertension
   ➡ Hyperlipidemia
   ➡Diabetes mellitus
   ➡ Smoking
   ➡Family history
2. Causes of chronic arterial ischemia
   ➡Atherosclerotic plaque
   _MOST_ common cause of chronic arterial insufficiency

- Multiple collaterals form to bypass the obstructed vessels as a compensatory mechanism
  ➡Buerger's disease (Thromboangiitis obliterans)
- Non-atherosclerotic, segmental, inflammatory disease
- Vasculitis that commonly affects small to medium-sized arteries and veins
- Patients are predominantly young and heavy smokers
- Presents with distal extremity ischemic, ischemic digit ulcers or digit gangrene
  ➡Behcet's disease
- Rare disease characterized by recurrent oral aphthae and any of the several systemic manifestation including genital aphthae, ocular disease, skin lesions, GI disease, neurological disease, vascular disease and arthritis
- Vasculitis in patients with Behcet's disease is remarkable for its ability to involve blood vessels of any sizes and to involve both arteries and veins
  ➡Popliteal entrapment syndrome
- Due to anomalous musculoskeletal attachments or an abnormal course of popliteal artery leading to compression of popliteal artery with activity
- Patients present with intermittent claudication but lacks atherosclerotic risk factors

3. Differential diagnosis of intermittent claudication
   ➡ Sciatica\*

- Non-specific term that describes variety of leg and back symptoms
- Radiculopathy (nerve root compression) at L5 – S1 from a herniated (prolapsed) disc
- Pain, numbness, tingling in the distribution of sciatic nerve
- Sharp or burning pain that radiates down the posterior or lateral aspect of leg usually to foot or ankle
  ➡Arthritis of the hip or foot\*
  ➡Chronic compartment syndrome
- Typically affects young heavy-muscled athletes
- Reversible form of acute compartment syndrome that develops when increased hydrostatic pressure within a skeletal muscle compartment compromises local tissue perfusion leading to pain and other symptoms
  ➡Baker's cysts
- Popliteal synovial cysts that usually arises in association with underlying joint disease
- Cyst forms as an enlargement of gastrocnemius semimembranosus bursa
- Presents with posterior knee pain and stiffness and a mass or swelling behind the knee

Neuropathic ulcers

➡General features

- Begins as minor traumatic wounds which fail to heal since blood supply is insufficient to meet the increased demand of healing tissues
- Can become infected resulting in cellulitis, abscess formation or spread to involve bones and joints causing osteomyelitis and septic arthritis
- Location of ischemic ulcers
  - Anterior shin
  - Base of heel
  - Malleolus and metatarsal heads (Sites of increased focal pressure)
  - Tips of toes and between digits (Termination of arterial branches)

933

2. Physical examination
   ➡Ankle-brachial index (ABI)

- Resting systolic ankle BP (posterior tibial/ dorsalis pedis whichever is higher) is divided by systolic brachial BP (left/right arm whichever is higher)
  - Ο Ankle pressure: Measured with BP cuff around the calf and the Doppler probe at the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial arteries
  - Ο Brachial pressure: Measured with BP cuff around the arm and Doppler probe at brachial artery and the cuff is inflated until arterial signal is obliterated and slow deflate until signal just starts being detected at which the pressure is recorded
- Provides a measure of severity of disease and confirm clinical suspicion of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease

| ABI         | Interpretation                                                                                  |

|             | - Arterial obstruction associated with claudication                                             |
| < 0.4       | ➡Critical limb ischemia                                                                         |
|             | - Arterial obstruction associated with ischemic rest pain, non- healing ulceration and gangrene |

- Exercise treadmill test
  - Ο Indicated in patients with classical history of intermittent claudication or atypical extremity pain but normal ABI at rest
  - Ο Measurement of ABI before and after patient exercise on treadmill and a ABI decrease of 0.2 indicates claudication
    ➡ Vascular examination
- Palpation of peripheral pulses
  - Ο **Upper extremities**: Carotid/ Subclavian/ Axillary/ Brachial/ Radial/ Ulnar
  - Ο **Lower extremities**: Femoral/ Popliteal/ Posterior tibial/ Dorsalis pedis
- Temperature, color, capillary refill
  - Ο Cool/ Pale/ Delayed capillary refill
- Trophic changes
  - Ο Loss of hair/ Dry, shiny and atrophy (thinning) of skin/ Brittle, ridged, hypertrophy (thickening) of nails/ Pointed toes
- Buerger test
  - Ο Elevation of foot with the patient lying supine until the veins are completely drained and then place the foot in dependent position
  - Ο **Normal**: Remains pink on elevation
  - Ο **Ischemia**: Pallor → Dusky flush spreading proximally from toes (rubrous or cyanotic color)
    ➡Neurological examination

934

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials
   ➡Clotting profile
   ⇨ RFT

- Aware of contrast nephropathy
  ➡Arterial blood gas (ABG)
- Look for lactic acidosis
  ➡Serum CK level
- Evaluation of rhabdomyolysis
  ➡Cardiac enzymes
- Indicated if suspecting an AMI with left ventricular mural thrombus

4. Radiological tests
   ➡Duplex ultrasound

- Duplex USG = 2D USG + Doppler technique
- Locate the level of obstruction
- Classify severity of acute arterial ischemia based on Doppler findings
- Normal arterial flow waveform should be triphasic and either monophasic or biphasic waveform are abnormal
  ➡Computed tomographic angiography (CTA)
- NO significant difference in accuracy between CTA and MRA
- Diagnose the location and severity of arterial stenosis or occlusion
  ➡Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)
- Avoid exposure to ionizing radiation and minimal risk of contrast nephropathy
- Diagnose the location and severity of arterial stenosis or occlusion
  ➡Catheter-based digital subtraction arteriography (DSA)
- Indicated only in patients with planned intervention such as angioplasty and stenting
- Digital subtraction removes underlying bone from the images so as to better visualize the arteries and is considered gold standard for evaluation of arterial tree before planning of revascularization
- Invasive technique and is associated with - Risk of contrast or drug allergy - Risk of bleeding from arterial puncture, worsening of ischemia due to arterial dissection or damage, hematoma formation and local infection
  ➡Adjuncts
- ECG to look for underlying cardiac arrhythmia and AMI
- CXR to look for widened mediastinum indicating aortic dissection
  935

VI. Treatment

1. General approach
   ➡Lifestyle modification

- HT/ DM/ Lipid control (statins)/ Weight reduction
- Supervised exercise training (e.g. treadmill)
- Stimulates collateral formation and blood flow to improve symptoms
  ➡TASC II (Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus) classification
- Classification according to anatomical distribution, number and nature of lesion (stenosis/ occlusion) and according to overall success rate of treating the lesion using surgical or endovascular means
  - Surgical revascularization = Arterial bypass grafting
  - Endovascular revascularization = Balloon angioplasty ± Stenting

[A footer containing the number 936 is present at the bottom right of the page.]

➡Treatment according to TASC classification

- **TASC A** = Endovascular treatment with excellent result
- **TASC B** = Endovascular treatment with good result and is preferred unless open revascularization is required for another lesion in same anatomical area
- **TASC C** = Open revascularization has better long-term result and is preferred unless the patient is at high risk for open surgical repair
- **TASC D** = Open revascularization is the primary treatment since endovascular treatment is associated with poor results

➡ Angioplasty **VS** Bypass grafting first

- Angioplasty is generally preferred as it is less-invasive although not as effective in treating symptoms of occlusion
- Bypass grafting is indicated when lesion cannot be treated by angioplasty or is associated with poor outcomes
  - Long-segment occlusion (lesions extends for a long distance)
  - Heavily calcified lesion
  - Absence of lumen for guide wires to pass through in complete occlusion
- For patients with estimated life expectancy ≤ 2 years or who do NOT have autogenous vein available as conduit → Balloon angioplasty
- For patients with estimated life expectancy > 2 years or who have autogenous vein available as conduit → Bypass surgery

2. Medical treatment (for claudication)
   ➡Cilostazol\* (**ONLY** FDA approved drug)

- Phosphodiesterase III (PDE III) inhibitor that suppresses platelet aggregation and is a direct arterial vasodilator
- Contraindicated in HF of any severity
  ➡ Naftidrofuryl
- 5HT2-receptor antagonist
- Fewer side effects than cilostazol
  ➡ Pentoxifylline (benefits not firmly established)
- Rheologic modifier
- Available data indicate that the benefit of pentoxifylline is marginal, particularly in light of more effective therapies such as cilostazol and naftidrofuryl
  ➡ Aspirin (benefits not firmly established)
- Data on currently available antiplatelet agents indicate only a modest improvement or no improvement in claudication symptoms can be expected and that a significant benefit may not be seen with aspirin alone
- Main indication for antiplatelet therapy remains the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke

937

3. Endovascular revascularization
   ➡Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) + stenting

- Less invasive alternative to surgery
- Stent placement
  - Stenting is indicated to salvage an unacceptable angioplasty results typically when residual stenosis after PTA is ≥ 30%
- Systemic anticoagulation should be maintained routinely during LL arterial interventions to minimize risk of pericatheter thrombosis
- All patients should be placed on antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin
- Advantages include lower procedural risk, repeatability and shorter recovery time
- Complications
  - Arterial dissection
  - Arterial rupture
  - Distal embolization
  - Restenosis of vessels

938

4. Surgical revascularization (Arterial bypass grafting)
   ➡ Choices of graft - Vein grafts - Best results are obtained with the use of autologous veins - Great saphenous vein remains the conduit of choice but lesser saphenous vein or arm veins provide suitable alternatives - Prosthetic grafts (Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts) - Patency is comparable between PTFE grafts and vein grafts for above-knee location but is associated with significantly lower patency for more distal bypass procedures
   ➡ Anatomical reconstruction - Aorto-bifemoral bypass - Preferred method of treatment of symptomatic aortoiliac occlusion - Femoro-popliteal bypass - Indicated in patients with superficial femoral artery or proximal popliteal artery occlusion in which the patent popliteal artery has luminal continuity with any of its three terminal branches
   ➡ Extra-anatomical reconstruction - Femoro-femoral bypass - Indicated in patients with unilateral iliac occlusion whose aorta and contralateral iliac artery are free of disease - Can be performed under local anesthesia and hence important in patients who are poor candidates for major surgery - Axillo-bifemoral bypass - +ve: Neither thoracic nor abdominal cavity is violated when performing an axillo-bifemoral graft and thus does not interfere with breathing, coughing or taking oral feedings - +ve: Can be performed under local anesthesia and hence important in patients who are poor candidates for major surgery - -ve: Poorer graft patency than aorto-femoral bypass and hence only reserve for high-risk patients with limb-threatening ischemia and is not commonly performed for intermittent claudication - Axillo-popliteal bypass - Used as final attempt to prevent amputation - Performed only when the usual options are not available due to groin infection with or without graft infection, operative scarring or involvement of iliac and femoral systems

939

5. Amputation
   ➡General features

- Reserved for patients with gangrene or persistent painful ischemia not amendable to
  vascular reconstruction
- Level of amputation depends on vascularity of limb and it indications - Necessary to remove all infected tissues - Ensure adequacy of blood supply to heal the amputation - Preserve as much length of extremity as possible since this improves patient's
  opportunity for rehabilitation
- Indications - **Dead**: Ischemia and unsalvageable - **Damage**: Trauma/ Burns - **Danger**: Gangrene/ Necrotising fasciitis/ Osteomyelitis/ Ascending sepsis/
  Malignancy
  ➡Different types of amputation
- Digital amputation
  - Indicated for isolated gangrene or recalcitrant osteomyelitis
- Transmetatarsal amputations - Indicated if several toes are involved in the ischemic process or after previous
  digit amputations
- Above knee amputation (AKA) = 50% of patients will be able to walk again
  - Heals more easily than BKA and is useful in older patients who do no ambulate
  - Unilateral = Increase energy expenditure by 100%
- Below knee amputation (BKA) = 90% of patients will be able to walk again - **MOST** common type of amputation performed - Unilateral = Increase energy expenditure by 40% - Bilateral = Increase energy expenditure by 60-70%

# Vascular Diseases

## Chronic venous disease

I. **Overview**

1. Description
   - Chronic venous disease is the most common vascular disorder
   - Refers to presence of morphological (i.e. venous dilation) or functional (i.e. venous reflux) abnormalities for long duration

2. Terminologies
   - Chronic venous insufficiency
     - Refers to presence of edema, skin changes or ulceration
     - Most commonly associated with chronic venous reflux

II. **Pathophysiology**

1. Anatomy of venous system of limbs

[Detailed anatomical illustration of the venous system in the legs. The illustration shows both an anterior and a posterior view. Key venous structures are labeled, including the common iliac, internal iliac, external iliac, gluteal, lateral sacral, internal pudendal, obturator, femoral, femoral circumflex, great saphenous, popliteal, small saphenous, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, fibular, dorsal venous arch, digital, lateral plantar, medial plantar, and plantar venous arch.

➡ Overview

- Venous anatomy is divided into 3 main compartments namely deep, superficial and perforating veins: **Blood flows from superficial to deep veins through perforators**
- Venous return from LL depends largely on compression of calf muscles including gastrocnemius and soleus during walking
- Flow is unidirectional due to a series of one-way valves which prevent reflux during this cycle of compression
- Failure of these valves to close leads to pooling, stasis and congestion of LL and subsequent dilatation of the superficial veins
  ➡ Deep veins
- Deep veins in the leg are named according to their paired arteries
- Deep veins in the calf are typically duplicated as venae comitantes with numerous communicating branches
- Example: Common femoral/ Femoral/ Deep femoral (_Profunda femoris_)/ Popliteal/ Anterior tibial/ Posterior tibial/ Fibular (Peroneal)
  ➡Superficial veins
- Example: Great (Long) saphenous/Lesser (Short/ Small) saphenous
  ➡Perforator (communicating) veins
- Perforators veins are valved veins that connect the superficial to the deep veins at inconstant sites allowing blood to flow from superficial to deep venous system
- Proximal thigh perforators: Hunterian perforators
- Mid-thigh perforators: Dodd perforators → Superficial femoral vein
- Below knee perforators: Boyd perforators → Gastrocnemius vein
- Lower leg perforators: Cockett I/II/III perforators → Posterior tibial vein
- Ankle perforators: May perforators → Posterior tibial vein and plantar vein

2. Natural course of veins

[Illustration of the veins in the legs. The illustration depicts the anterior and posterior views of both legs, highlighting the femoral vein, accessory saphenous vein, great saphenous vein, saphenous nerve (infrapatellar branch), saphenous nerve (terminal branch of femoral nerve), small saphenous vein, branches of saphenous nerve, and sural nerve. The veins are shown in blue, and the nerves are shown in yellow. The anterior view shows the veins and nerves running down the front of the leg, while the posterior view shows them running down the back of the leg.]

➡Great saphenous veins

- Arise from medial side of dorsal venous arch of foot
- Ascends immediately in front of medial malleolus
  - Accompanied by the saphenous nerve
- Runs up the leg posteriorly behind the medial border of patella
- Ascends obliquely in the medial aspect of thigh
- Pierces the cribriform fascia at sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ) and drains into the femoral vein - SFJ is located 2.5 cm inferolateral to the pubic tubercle
  ➡Lesser saphenous (Short/ Small) saphenous veins
- Arise from lateral side of dorsal venous arch of foot
- Ascends immediately behind lateral malleolus
- Runs up the leg along the midline of calf
- Pierces the deep fascia over popliteal fossa and drains into the popliteal vein
  - Accompanied by the sural nerve

3. Pathophysiology of venous drainage
   ➡Drainage of deep veins

- Major mechanism for venous drainage is calf muscle pump
- Contraction of calf muscles compresses large venous sinuses in the muscles
  - Squeezes blood into the popliteal veins and back to the heart
- Veins have bicuspid valves to prevent backflow of blood
  - Ensure unidirectional flow of blood towards the heart
    ➡Drainage of superficial veins
- Presence of perforator (communicating) veins which allows communication between deep and superficial venous system
- Opening of perforator (communicating) veins during calf muscle relaxation
  - Blood are drained into deep veins from superficial veins
  - Perforator (communicating) veins contain one-way valve which ensure unidirectional flow of blood from superficial to deep veins only

2. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Limb pain

- Site: Generalized (i.e. aching) or localized to specific veins, areas of lipodermatosclerosis or ulceration
- Exacerbating factors: Standing or when seated with feet dependent for prolonged period
- Relieving factors: Limb elevation and walking
  ➡Limb swelling
- Exacerbating factors: Standing or when seated with feet dependent for prolonged period
- Relieving factors: Limb elevation and walking
  ➡Limb discomfort
- Tiredness
- Heaviness
  ➡Skin discoloration or redness
  ➡ Itchiness
  ➡Numbness/Tingling sensation
  ➡Muscle cramping

V. Diagnosis

1. Radiological tests
   ➡Continuous wave Doppler

- Easily performed in the office using a handheld probe (_pen-like probe_)
- Helpful for screrning reflux at saphenofemoral (SFJ) and saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ)
- Limited clinical use due to inability to quantitate reflux and to prove precise antaomical information
  ➡Venous duplex USG
- Duplex = B-mode USG + Doppler technique
- With the leg in depednent position, cuffs are placed on the thigh, calf and foot and inflated and then rapidly deflated in an attempt to create retrograde venous blood flow in segments of valvular incompetence
- Indications
  - Recurrent varicose veins
  - Complications of chronic venous insufficiency including hyperpigementation, venous stasis eczema or venous ulcers
  - History of superficial thrombophlebitis or DVT
- Number (SFJ/ SPJ), location, diameter and extent of reflux of incompetent saphenous vein, perforating vein or other relevant veins
  - Reflux is defined as retrograde flow in the reverse direction to physiological flow
  - Competent valve normally takes no more than 0.5s to close
  - Valve closure time is assesed usually within the great saphenous vein with time lasting > 0.5s defined as abnormal
- Competence and evidence of previous DVT in the deep venous system
  - DVT has to be excluded since it is a contraindication to varicose vein surgery

VI. **Treatment**

1. General principles
   ➡Principles of treatment

- Improve O2 transport to skin and subcutaneous tissue
- Decreases inflammation
- Decreases edema and compress dilated veins

2. Conservative treatment
   ➡Leg elevation and exercise
   ➡Compression therapy

- Compression stockings
  - Relieves symptoms and improve quality of life (QOL)
  - Promotes venous ulcers healing
- Paste gauze boots (Unna's boots)
  - Combination of compression therapy with zinc oxide paste that assists in wound healing
  - Indicated when there is skin ulceration to prevent further skin breakdown
  - Advantages
    - Requires minimal patient involvement
    - Provides continuous compression and topical therapy
  - Disadvantages
    - Bulky and uncomfortable which affect compliance
    - Ulcer cannot be monitored after boot is applied
    - Technique is labour intensive and operator-dependent
- Pneumatic compression devices - Provides dynamic sequential compression - Used primarily to prevent DVT in hospitalized patients but also used successfully to treat venous sufficiency

# Vascular Diseases

## Varicose veins

I. Overview

1.  General features
    ➡ Definition = Dilated tortuous subcutaneous veins ≥ 3 mm in diameter measured in the upright position with demonstrable reflux
    - Reflux disease from venous valvular incompetence accounts for majority (> 80%) of chronic venous disease
    - Obstructive disease is a less common cause of venous pathology with reflux often being present simultaneously

II. Epidemiology

1.  General epidemiology
    ➡ More common in older people
    ➡ More common in female (10x)
    ➡ More common in Europe and North America

III. Etiology 1. Risk factors
➡ Females
➡ Aging
➡ Obesity
➡ Family history - Family history of varicose veins
➡ Medical history - Increased abdominal pressure such as chronic cough and constipation - Previous DVT or superficial thrombophlebitis
➡ Occupational - Requires prolonged standing 2. Causes of varicose veins
➡ Primary varicose veins - Idiopathic - Congenital and intrinsic abnormalities in venous wall components - Dysfunctional smooth muscle cell proliferation, collagen deposition, decreased elastin content and increased matrix metalloproteinases
➡ Secondary varicose veins

| Classification                      | Causes                                                                                                                                         |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Obstruction to venous flow          | ➡ Pregnancy ➡ Superficial thrombophlebitis ➡ External compression - Ovarian cysts - Fibroid - Pelvic cancer (CA cervix/ uterus/ ovary/ rectum) |
| Valvular destruction or dysfunction | ➡ Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - DVT accounts for most secondary cases                                                                           |
| Increased flow and pressure         | ➡ Arterio-venous (AV) fistula                                                                                                                  |

[Posterior view of a human leg with the venous system highlighted in blue. Labels point to the different veins: Common iliac, External iliac, Internal iliac, Gluteal, Lateral sacral, Internal pudendal, Obturator, Femoral, Femoral circumflex, Femoral, Great saphenous, Popliteal, Small saphenous, Anterior tibial, Posterior tibial, Fibular, Lateral plantar, Medial plantar, Plantar venous arch. Deep femoral vein is also labeled.]

[A diagram shows the relationships between the veins. From left to right: External iliac vein connects to Common femoral vein, which connects to Femoral vein and Great saphenous vein. Femoral vein connects to Deep femoral vein (Profunda femoris). Femoral vein connects to Popliteal vein (Continuation of femoral vein). Popliteal vein connects to Anterior tibial vein, Posterior tibial vein, and Short saphenous vein. Anterior tibial vein connects to Fibular (Peroneal) vein.]

➡ Deep veins

- Common femoral/ Femoral/ Deep femoral (Profunda femoris)/ Popliteal/ Anterior tibial/ Posterior tibial/ Fibular (Peroneal)
  ➡ Superficial veins
- Great (Long) saphenous/ Lesser (Short/ Small) saphenous
  ➡ Perforator (communicating) veins
- Perforators veins are valved veins that join the superficial to the deep veins at inconstant sites allowing blood to flow from superficial to deep venous system
- Proximal thigh perforators: Hunterian perforators
- Mid-thigh perforators: Dodd perforators → Superficial femoral vein
- Below knee perforators: Boyd perforators → Gastrocnemius vein
- Lower leg perforators: Cockett I/II/III perforators → Posterior tibial vein
- Ankle perforators: May perforators → Posterior tibial vein and plantar vein

2. Neurovascular of lower limb

[Image of a diagram showing the neurovascular anatomy of the lower limb from two angles. On the left, an anterior view shows the femoral vein branching into the accessory saphenous vein and the great saphenous vein. The saphenous nerve, with its infrapatellar branch, runs alongside the great saphenous vein. On the right, a posterior view shows the accessory saphenous vein, great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein, branches of the saphenous nerve, and the sural nerve.]

➡Great saphenous veins

- Arise from medial side of dorsal venous arch of foot
- Ascends anterior to medial malleolus
  - Accompanied by the saphenous nerve
- Runs up the leg posteriorly behind the medial border of patella
- Ascends obliquely in the medial aspect of thigh
- Pierces the cribriform fascia at sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ) and drains into the femoral vein - SFJ is located 2.5 cm lateral and inferior to the pubic tubercle
  ➡Lesser saphenous (Short/ Small) saphenous veins
- Arise from lateral side of dorsal venous arch of foot
- Ascends posterior to lateral malleolus
- Runs up the leg along the midline of calf
- Pierces the deep fascia over popliteal fossa and drains into the popliteal vein
  - Accompanied by the sural nerve

V. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Disfiguring effect of the veins
   - Unsightly apperanace is usually the principle complaint
   - Truncal, tributary, reticular and perforatory varicosities
     ➡ Pain/ Aching
   - Site: Usually felt in the calf and lower leg
   - Character: Dull ache, tingling, burning in character
   - Exacerbating factor: Standing for prolonged periods
   - Relieving factor: Lying down, leg elevation or wearing compression stocking
     ➡ Heaviness
     ➡ Ankle swelling
     ➡ Night cramps
     ➡ Itchiness
     ➡ Early faitigue
     ➡ More severe signs
   - Hyperpigmentation
   - Lipodermatosclerosis
   - Thrombophlebitis
   - Ulceration
   - Bleeding from attenuated vein clusters

955

VI. Diagnosis

1. History taking
   ➡ Medical history

- Pregnancy
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
  ➡Family history
- Varicose veins
  ➡ Social history
- Occupation that stands for prolonged periods

2. Physical examination
   ➡ Inspection

- Presence of scars
- Location of varicosities
  - Medial thigh and medial calf varicosities suggest long saphenous vein
    incompetence
  - Posterior calf varicosities suggest short saphenous vein incompetence
  - Anterolateral thigh and anterolateral calf varicosities suggest isolated
    incompetence of proximal anterolateral long saphenous tributary
- Signs of chronic venous insufficiency - Overlying skin changes (corona phlebectatica/ hyperpigmentation/ atrophie
  blanche/ venous stasis eczema/ lipodermatosclerosis) - Venous ulcers
  ➡ Palpation
- Palpate along the course of saphenous veins and their tributaries to feel for the
  varicosities and tenderness
- Palpate for peripheral pulses
  - Rule out peripheral artery disease since management of varicose vein include
    compression of limbs
- Pitting edema
  - Result of increase in volume of fluid in skin and subcutaneous tissue
  - Confined to ankle area usually but can extend to foot and rest of the leg
- Saphena varix
  - Palpate the inguinal region for a saphena varix which presents as a compressible
    lump that refills when released

956

Leg horizontal, superficial veins empty

[Image: This image shows a cross-section of a leg with veins. The first image shows a leg lying horizontally with superficial veins that are empty. The vein system includes the superficial vein at the top, then the muscle, the deep vein below it, and the fascia at the bottom. A band encircles the superficial veins and is labeled "Tourniquet occludes the superficial veins". The tourniquet is placed around the leg to constrict blood flow in the superficial veins.]

The patient stands up

[Image: The image contains two diagrams depicting the effect of a tourniquet on incompetent communicating veins in the leg of a patient standing up. In the left diagram, the tourniquet is placed above the incompetent communicating vein, which fills the superficial veins below the tourniquet. In the right diagram, the tourniquet is placed below the incompetent communicating vein, which fills the superficial veins above the tourniquet. The veins are colored blue, and the tourniquet is represented as a dark band.]

➡Tourniquet tests

- Procedures
  - Patient should lie on a bed with the leg elevated
  - Veins are emptied by stroking the blood within the veins towards the heart
  - Tourniquet is pulled tight around the upper thigh and held in place by forceps
  - Patient is asked to stand up quickly and the legs are observed for refilling
- Superficial to deep valvular incompetence at sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ) which is 2.5 cm below and lateral to the pubic tubercle
  - Veins above tourniquet will rapidly fill
  - Veins below tourniquet will remain collapsed
  - Confirmed by releasing tourniquet and watching veins below rapidly filled
- Interpretation
  - **NO refilling below tourniquet** = Incompetence at level of tourniquet
  - **Refilling below tourniquet** = Other sites of incompetence below level of tourniquet
- Remarks
  _ Test can be repeated with tourniquet moving progressively down the whole length of the leg to define all sites of superficial to deep vein incompetence (mid-thigh > below knee > mid-calf)
  _ Easier and simpler to apply once below the knee to exclude short saphenous incompetence
  ➡Completion of examination
- Auscultate over varicosities for AV malformations
- Examine inguinal region for mass or lymphadenopathy causing venous outflow obstruction

957

3. Radiological tests
   ➡ Venous duplex USG

- Indications
  - Recurrent varicose veins
  - Complications of chronic venous insufficiency including hyperpigementation, venous stasis eczema or venous ulcers
  - History of superficial thrombophlebitis or DVT
- Number (SFJ/SPJ), location, diameter and extent of reflux of incompetent saphenous vein, perforating vein or other relevant veins
  - Reflux is defined as retrograde flow in the reverse direction to physiological flow
  - Valve closure time is assesed usually within the great saphenous vein with time lasting > 0.5s defined as abnormal
- Competence and evidence of previous DVT in the deep venous system
  - DVT has to be excluded since it is a contraindication to varicose vein surgery

VII. Treatment

1. General approach
   ➡ Minimally-invasive approach _VS_ Surgical approach - Endovenous therapy and surgery appears to be equally effective - Endovenous therapy is associated with less post-operative pain and analgesic use with minimal postoperative QOL impairment
   ➡ Contraindications to lower extremity venous ablation therapy - Pregnancy - Superficial or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - Congenital venous abnormalities - Moderate to severe peripheral artery disease (PAD)

2. Conservative treatment
   ➡ Leg elevation and exercise
   ➡ Compression stockings - Patients may be prescribed with elastic compression stockings ranging from 20 – 30, 30 – 40 or even 40 – 50 mmHg - Stockings range in length from knee high to waist high and it should cover the symptomatic varices - Below-knee stockings are usually prescribed due to better patient acceptance - Significantly improves varicose vein symptoms BUT no evidence to suggest is prevent occurrence or progression of varicose veins - Compliance rate and long-term tolerance is poor and incorrect application of compression stockings can lead to pressure necrosis or tourniquet effects - Contraindicated in patients with DVT
   [Image of page number 958 at the bottom right corner]

3. Minimally-invasive therapy
   ➡Injection sclerotherapy

- Indicated in C1 diseases such as telangiectasia, reticular veins and small varicose veins <
  3 mm in diameter
- USG-guided foam sclerotherapy injects irritant agent into superficial veins to destroy
  endothelial lining of vein by detergent or osmotic action to obliterate the varicosities
- Detergent are surface active agents that damage the endothelium by interfering
  with cell membrane lipids
- Osmotic agents achieve their effect by dehydrating endothelial cells through
  osmosis
- Types of sclerosing agent includes
- Sodium tetradecyl sulfate (detergent) (most commonly studied)
- Polidocanol (detergent)
- Hypertonic saline (osmotic agent)
- Compression stocking or elastic bandage is then applied at the end of procedures and
  should be worn for several days to weeks to produce apposition of inflamed vein walls
  and prevent thrombus formation
- Improves symptoms but recurrence rate and the need of intervention is high
- Complications
- Skin pigmentation
- Skin necrosis
- Thrombophlebitis
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
- Allergic reactions
  ➡Adhesive glue (VenaSeal)
- Cyanoacrylate glue is an adhesive agent which is used to seal off varicose veins
- Agent is injected sequentially through a catheter followed by compression along the
  length of vein from proximal to distal
- Advantages
- Non-thermal non-tumescent technique (less burns and needle injection)
- Tumescent is a dilate lidocaine mixture injected around the vein to
  anesthetize the area and provide heat-sink so surrounding tissues are not
  damaged during treatment with high temperature such as ablation
- Compression stockings are **NOT** required postoperatively

[Image Description: The number 959 is located at the bottom right corner of the image.]

➡Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)\*

- **Preferred** treatment modalities but self-paid under HA system
- Endovenous ablation technique has gained popularity since it is associated with more rapid recovery than traditional surgical removal of affected vein
- Insertion of laser fibre into lumen of an incompetent vein under ultrasound guidance with subsequent thermal ablation of the vein
- Comparison with RFA
  - Higher success rate than RFA
  - Less expensive than RFA
- Complications
  - Skin burns
  - Bruising or ecchymosis
  - Superficial thrombophlebitis (reduced with NSAIDs)
  - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
  - Saphenous nerve injury

➡Endovenous radiofrequency (RFA) ablation

- Use of bipolar catheter to achieve thermal ablation of the vein
- Endovenous ablation technique has gained popularity since it is associated with more rapid recovery than traditional surgical removal of affected vein
- Comparison with EVLA
  - Faster recovery than EVLA
  - Less post-operative pain and analgesics use than EVLA
- Complications - Skin burns - Bruising or ecchymosis - Superficial thrombophlebitis (reduced with NSAIDs) - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - Saphenous nerve injury
  960

4. Surgical treatment (Ligation ± Stripping ± Avulsion)
   ➡ Procedures

- Ligation
  - High ligation of sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ) (Trendelenburg operation)
    - Oblique incision is made over the groin below inguinal ligament over the femoral artery and extending medially for 4 cm
    - Flush ligation means typing up the great saphenous vein very close to the junction with femoral vein since if saphenous vein is ligated too distal from SFJ, the remaining stump of great saphenous vein and all the tributaries will also get dilated forming a saphena varix
    - Tributaries of saphenous veins are dissected and ligated individually
  - High ligation of sapheno-popliteal junction (SPJ)
- Stripping
  - Pass a metal wire through saphenous vein and strip the vein in a proximal direction with the aid of an olive placed distally
  - Stripping is required to decrease the risk of recurrence due to persistent venous reflux via thigh perforators or neovascularization in the groin
  - Stripping of long saphenous vein is limited to thigh ONLY since stripping below knee to ankle does not improve symptomatic relief but significantly increases the risk of saphenous nerve injury (Close proximity of saphenous nerve and vein in distal calf)
  - Stripping of short saphenous vein is possible but should be cautious to avoid sural nerve injury
- Stab avulsion
  - Preoperatively the varicose veins are marked with indelible ink
  - Multiple small incisions are made directly over branch varicosities and the vein is elevated from the incision with a small vein hook, divided and avulsed from the surrounding subcutaneous tissues which removes the tributary varicosities

# Respiratory Disease

## Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)

I. General features

1. Description
   ➡ Patients with PE usually die from right heart failure (cardiogenic shock) rather than hypoxemia
   ➡ DVT is commonly associated with pulmonary embolism (PE)
   ➡ DVT and PE are two manifestations of the same disorders
   ➡ DVT of lower extremity is subdivided into 2 categories - **Proximal vein thrombosis** - Thrombi involves popliteal, femoral or iliac veins - Clinically more significant as it more commonly associates with PE - **Distal (Calf) vein thrombosis** - Thrombi involves deep calf veins

II. Etiology

1. Risk factors for thrombosis
   ➡ Medical history - **Malignancy** (Hypercoagulability) - Especially adenocarcinoma which secretes mucin - Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) - Gynecological malignancy obstructing LL veins - Stroke - Obesity - Prior venous thromboembolism - Trauma of lower extremity - Immobilization - Prolonged hospitalization or bed rest - Occupational immobilization - Air travel
   ➡ Recent surgery
   ➡ Pregnancy or post-partum - Pregnancy increases coagulation factors
   ➡ Oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
   ➡ Inherited conditions - Anti-thrombin III deficiency - Protein C deficiency - Protein S deficiency - Factor V Leiden
   ➡ Acquired conditions - Lupus anticoagulants - Antiphospholipid syndrome
   ➡ Others - Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria - Homocysteinemia - Nephrotic syndrome

962

## 2. Etiology

➡ Non-thrombotic etiology of PE

- Tumor embolism
- Air embolism
- Fat embolism
  - Following pelvic or long bone fracture

## III. Pathogenesis

### 1. Virchow's triad

➡ **Stasis + Endothelial injury + Hypercoagulability**

- **Stasis** = Prolonged bed rest/ Air travel > 6 hours/ Congestive heart failure (CHF)/ Cerebrovascular accident within 3 months
- **Endothelial injury** = Surgery/ Trauma/ Prior DVT/ Central catheter placement
- **Hypercoagulability** = _See risk factors above_

## IV. Clinical manifestations

### 1. Signs and symptoms

➡ Features of involved extremity

- Unilateral pitting edema
- 腫: Swelling with difference in calf diameters
- 紅/熱: Erythema/ Warmth
- 疼: Pain/Tenderness of calf or thigh (along distribution of deep veins)
  ➡ Signs suggesting PE
- Cough
- Pleuritic chest pain
- Dyspnea on exertion
  - Secondary to pleural effusion
- Hemoptysis
  - Tissues become anoxic or hypoxic in pulmonary infarction
- Shock
  - Obstructive shock
  - Hypotension due to decrease in venous return (VR) in venous thrombosis and decrease cardiac output (CO) in pulmonary artery blockage

### 2. Differential diagnosis

➡ Differential diagnosis of DVT

- Muscle strain/ tear/ twisting/ injury to leg
- Cellulitis
- Superficial thrombophlebitis
- Lymphangitis
- Lymphedema
- Venous valvular insufficiency
- Ruptured Baker's cyst

[X-ray image showing a lung with a region of decreased vascularity. The words "Westermark's sign" are written in blue below the image]

➡ CXR

- Hampton's hump (Wedge-shaped infarction)
  - Hump-shaped opacity or density in the periphery of lung with its base abutting pleura (against pleural surface) and humps towards the hilum
- Westermark sign
  - Avascularity distal to the PE
  - Demonstration of a sharp cut-off of pulmonary vessels with distal hypoperfusion in a segmental distribution within the lung
- Pleural effusion
  - Usually does not requiring tapping for therapeutic and diagnostic purpose
- Atelectasis - Decreased ventilation in alveoli that is deprived of blood supply to improve V/Q ratio - Collapse of segment which is infarcted due to embolism
  ➡Venous Duplex USG\*
- Duplex = B-mode USG + Doppler technique
- Lower extremity compression USG to look for evidence of DVT
- Assess for deep vein thrombosis in lower extremity and source of emboli
- Loss of vein compressibility is used as primary criterion for DVT
  ➡CT pulmonary angiogram (CTРА)\*
- **Confirmatory** test (Diagnostic)
- Look for filling defects in pulmonary trunk

966

➡Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan

- High sensitivity (98%) but low specificity (10%)
- V/Q mismatch with perfusion defect but preserved ventilation
- Presence of multiple segmental and subsegmental involvement of perfusion defects
- Atelectasis following pulmonary infarction or background lung diseases will also lead to ventilation defect and hence V/Q scan is inferior to CT pulmonary angiogram - Important that CXR should be normal otherwise V/Q scan will be indeterminate
  ➡ Echocardiogram (Transthoracic/Transesophageal)
- Identify saddle, right or left main PE
- Assess RV volume and dysfunction due to right heart strain
- McConnell's sign
  - Hypokinesis of RV free wall
  - Normal or hyperkinetic motion of RV apex

## 2. Treatment approach

- ➡Parenteral therapy (UFH/LMWH/Fondaparinux) bridged to warfarin
- ➡Parenteral therapy (UFH/LMWH/Fondaparinux) bridged to NOAC

968

3. Medical treatment
   ➡ Heparin

- LMW heparin (LMWH)
  - Continued for ≥ 5 days
  - Preferred over unfractionated heparin especially in cancer patients since it can decrease recurrence and mortality compared with UFH and warfarin
  - Example and dosage
    - SC Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg BID
    - SC Dalteparin 200 IU/kg QD
- Unfractionated heparin (UFH)
  - Continued for ≥ 5 days
  - Dose should be sufficient to prolong APTT to 1.5 – 2.5x the mean of control value or upper limit of normal APTT range
  - Preferred option when contemplating thrombolysis or catheter-based treatment
  - Preferred when there is renal failure (CrCl < 25), extreme obesity, hemodynamic instability or bleeding risk
  - Example and dosage
    - IV UFH 80 U/kg bolus 18 U/kg/hr and titrate to APTT 1.5–2.5x
- Fondaparinux
  - Continued for ≥ 5 days
  - Oral anticoagulants with vitamin K antagonist should be overlapped for ≥ 4 -5 days
  - Example and dosage
    - SC Fondaparinux 5 - 10 mg QD

[Image Description: The image is a table comparing the advantages of unfractionated heparin and LMW Heparin. The table has three columns, the first one contains the header "Advantages", the second one contains the header "Unfractionated Heparin" and lists the following advantages: Faster onset of action with intravenous administration; Easier to stop therapy due to shorter duration of anticoagulant effect; Easier to be inactivated with protamine sulphate. The third column contains the header "LMW Heparin" and lists the following advantages: Greater bioavailability; Longer duration of anticoagulant effect decreasing number of daily administration; Better correlation between dose and response allowing administration of fixed dose without laboratory monitoring; Extensive clinical experience with subcutaneous administration; Lower risk of HIT; Lower risk of osteoporosis.]

969

➡ Warfarin

- Vitamin K antagonist
- **NOT** initiated as monotherapy during acute thrombotic illness due to a paradoxical exacerbation of hypercoagulability which increases likelihood of thrombosis
  - Warfarin has a transient procoagulant effect during the 1 – 2 days of use
  - Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent gamma carboxylation of the anticoagulant factor protein S and protein C which inhibit activated factors VIII and V
- Initiated **simultaneously** with heparin with initial dose = 5 mg/day and overlap for ≥ 5 days with parenteral anticoagulants until INR ≥ 2.0 for ≥ 24 hours
  - Warfarin requires at least 5 days to reach therapeutic level
- Prolong INR to a target of 2.5 (Range: 2.0 – 3.0)
- Heparin product can be discontinued on day 5/6 when INR has been therapeutic for two consecutive days
- Antidote is vitamin K with FFP in case of overshoot INR

➡ Novel anticoagulant agents (NOAC)

- Attractive candidates as initial oral anticoagulants in patients with acute VTE due to the quicker onset of action
- Can give as sole anticoagulant with initial loading dose for rivaroxaban and apixaban (OR)
- Initiate after ≥ 5 days of parenteral coagulation for edoxaban and dabigatran
- **Direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitors**: Dabigatran
- **Direct factor Xa inhibitor**: Rivaroxaban/ Apixaban/ Edoxaban

➡Thrombolytic (Fibrinolytic) agents

- Route of administration
  - Continuous IV thrombolytic infusion are the most common method of administration
  - Catheter-based thrombolysis by direct infusion of thrombolytic agents into pulmonary artery via pulmonary arterial catheter can be considered for patients with persistent hemodynamic instability despite systemic thrombolysis
- Indications
  - Hemodynamically unstable PE
  - Massive ilio-femoral thrombosis
  - RV dilatation
- Examples
  - tPA/ Streptokinase

[Image Description: The number 970 is at the bottom right of the page.]

4. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Catheter-directed intervention

- Fibrinolytics with thrombus fragmentation or aspiration
- Consider if extensive DVT and to decrease post-thrombotic syndrome
- Consider if PE with hemodynamic compromise or high risk and not candidate for systemic lysis or surgical thrombectomy
  ➡ Thrombectomy (Embolectomy)
- Indicated in patients with obstructive or cardiogenic shock or evidence of RV dysfunction
- Surgical procedures
- Catheter-based embolectomy ± Adjunctive catheter-based thrombolysis
- Surgical embolectomy
  ➡ IVC filter placement
- Used for prevention of PE by filtering blood clots
- Venous access site
- Internal jugular vein
- Common femoral vein
- Brachial/ Basilic vein (upper extremity peripheral vein approach less commonly used)
- Filter positioning
- Position = Tip of filter just at the inflow of renal veins
- Minimizes the accumulation of thrombus above the filter in the event of filter thrombosis
- If the filter is substantially below the renal vein inflow, then the dead space between the thrombosed filter and renal veins may allow a blot to form potentially leading to pulmonary embolism
- If the filter is placed across the renal veins, they may not be stable in a pararenal location due to inability of fixation mechanism to fully engage the IVC wall but it has no significant effect on renal function
- Recommended when
- Contraindicated or failure to anticoagulant therapy
- Chronic recurrent embolism with pulmonary PE
- High risk for proximal vein thrombosis or PE
- Recurrent thromboembolism despite adequate anticoagulation

VII. Prognosis

1. Complication of DVT
   ➡ Pulmonary embolism (PE)
   ➡ Chronic venous insufficiency

- Leads to pulmonary hypertension
  ➡ Chronic venous obstruction
- Leads to pulmonary hypertension

VIII. Prevention

1. Prevention
   ➡Screening of malignancy

- Malignancy is a risk factor for development of DVT

2. Prophylaxis
   ➡ Compression stocking
   ➡ Posturing
   ➡Low-dose heparin

[Image of a white page with a header that reads "Prevention" and two numbered sections below it, each with bullet points. The first section is titled "Prevention" and lists "Screening of malignancy" with a sub-bullet that states "Malignancy is a risk factor for development of DVT". The second section is titled "Prophylaxis" and lists "Compression stocking", "Posturing", and "Low-dose heparin". At the bottom of the page, there's a small number "972".]

# Endocrine Diseases

## Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism

I. **Physiology**

1. Thyroid hormone synthesis

[Detailed diagram of thyroid hormone synthesis. The diagram shows the following steps: 1) Thyroglobulin is synthesized and discharged into the follicle lumen. 2) Iodide (I-) is trapped (actively transported in). 3) Iodide is oxidized to iodine. 4) Iodine is attached to tyrosine in colloid, forming DIT and MIT. 5) Iodinated tyrosines are linked together to form T3 and T4. 6) Thyroglobulin colloid is endocytosed and combined with a lysosome. 7) Lysosomal enzymes cleave T4 and T3 from thyroglobulin and hormones diffuse into bloodstream. The diagram also labels: Thyroid follicular cells, Colloid, Tyrosines (part of thyroglobulin molecule), Golgi apparatus, Rough ER, Iodide (I-), Lysosome, To peripheral tissues, -Thyro- globulin colloid, Colloid in lumen of follicle.]

(1) Thyroglobulin biosynthesis

- Thyroglobulin is synthesized in ribosomes of follicle cells
- Stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and cAMP
- Thyroglobulin in follicular cells is incorporated into exocytotic vesicles and extruded into colloid in lumen of follicle
  (2) Thyroid hormone biosynthesis
- **Iodide trapping**: Dietary iodide is taken up actively by Na-I symporter
- **Oxidation**: Iodide is oxidize to iodine by thyroidal peroxidase
- **Iodination / Organification**: Tyrosine residue in thyroglobulin is iodinated and form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT)
- **Coupling**: MIT and DIT are coupled together to form T3 and T4
  (3) Secretion of thyroid hormones
- Stimulation of thyroid gland leads to endocytosis of colloid
- Endocytic vesicles fuse with lysosomes inside the follicular cells
- T3 and T4 are cleaved from the thyroglobulin and released into circulation
  (4) Transport of thyroid hormones
- Associate with binding proteins in the circulation
  - Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) (70%)
  - Pre-albumin (15%)
  - Albumin (15%)
  - Free in circulation (< 1%)
- Only free and albumin-bound thyroid hormone is biologically available to tissues

973

2. Activation and inactivation of TH
   ➡Deiodination reactions in the peripheral tissues activate and inactivate TH

- Deiodinase Type 1 / 2 / 3 to catalyse the reaction
- Deiodination of T4 into T3 (**active**) or reverse T3 (**inactive**)

3. Mechanism of TH action
   ➡ Thyroid hormones receptors (TRs)

- Located in the nuclei of target cells
- Bound to thyroid hormone response elements in DNA
  ➡Mechanism of action
- Cells receive free thyroid hormones (TH) from blood
- T4 is deiodinated to T3 once inside cell
- T3 then enters nucleus and binds to thyroid hormone receptors (TRs)
- T3 triggers the dissociation of corepressor from TRs and binding of coactivator
- TRs and T3 forms a complex with another nuclear receptor known as retinoid X receptor (RxR) to initiate gene transcription
- Results in mRNA and protein production

Note:
➡ PTH has a half-life (t1/2) = 3 - 5 mins
➡ TSH has a half-life (t1/2) = 1 hour
➡ T4 is inactive and must be converted into T3 before it can produce biological effect.

IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism

Symptoms
➡Hyperactivity/ Irritability/ Dysphoria
➡Heat intolerance and increased sweating
➡ Palpitations
➡Fatigue and weakness
➡Weight loss with increased appetite
➡ Diarrhea
➡ Polyuria
➡Oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea
➡Loss of libido
Signs
➡ Tachycardia and AF
➡ Tremor
➡ Goitre
➡Warm and moist skin
➡ Muscle weakness and proximal myopathy
➡Lid lag and lid retraction

- Permissive effect on catecholamine leading to sympathetic overactivity
- Sustained contraction of superior tarsal muscles
  ➡Gynecomastia

➡Grave's ophthalmopathy (Thyroid-eye disease) ("NO SPECS" scoring system mnemonic)

- **0** = No signs and symptoms
- **1** = Only signs no symptoms
  - Lid retraction and lid lag (Result of excess sympathetic activity and are not specific to Grave's disease whereas others are more specific)
  - Leads to a staring appearance
- **2** = Soft tissue involvement
  - Periorbital edema
- **3** = Proptosis
  - Best detected by visualizing the sclera between lower border of iris and lower eyelid
- **4** = Extraocular muscle involvement
  - Diplopia/Ophthalmoplegia (Inferior rectus muscle is affected first and then goes anticlockwise (IR → MR → SR → LR))
- **5** = Corneal involvement
  - With corneal ulceration, scleral injection, chemosis and conjunctivitis
- **6** = Sight loss
  - Compression of CN II leading to papilloedema, peripheral field defects and blindness

2. Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism

Symptoms
➡Fatigue and weakness
➡ Dry skin
➡ Cold intolerance
➡ Hair loss
➡Difficulty concentrating and poor memory
➡ Constipation
➡Weight gain with decreased appetite
➡ Dyspnea
➡Hoarseness
➡Menorrhagia (later oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea)
➡Paraesthesia
➡Impaired hearing
Signs
➡Dry and cold skin
➡Puffiness of face, hands and feet

- Myxedema
  ➡ Alopecia
  ➡ Bradycardia
  ➡ Peripheral non-pitting edema
  ➡ Hyporeflexia
  ➡Delayed tendon reflex relaxation
  ➡ Carpal tunnel syndrome

V. Diagnosis

1. Diagnostic protocol

EVALUATION OF THYROTOXICOSIS
Measure TSH, unbound T4

[Image Description: A flowchart describing the evaluation of thyrotoxicosis.
It starts with measuring TSH and unbound T4. There are four initial branches depending on the results: TSH low and unbound T4 high, TSH low and unbound T4 normal, TSH normal or increased and high unbound T4, TSH and unbound T4 normal.

- If TSH is low and unbound T4 is high, then the diagnosis is primary thyrotoxicosis.
- If TSH is low and unbound T4 is normal, then measure unbound T3. If unbound T3 is high, then T3 toxicosis. If unbound T3 is normal, then subclinical hyperthyroidism.
  - If T3 toxicosis or subclinical hyperthyroidism are diagnosed, then ask "Features of Graves' disease?". If Yes, then Graves' disease. If No, then Multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma.
    - If Graves' disease or Multinodular goiter/toxic adenoma is diagnosed, then ask if Toxic nodular hyperthyroidism. If Yes, then toxic nodular hyperthyroidism. If No, then Low radionuclide uptake.
      - If toxic nodular hyperthyroidism or low radionuclide uptake is diagnosed, then ask "Destructive thyroiditis, iodine excess or excess thyroid hormone?". If Yes, then destructive thyroiditis, iodine excess or excess thyroid hormone. If No, then Rule out other causes including stimulation by chorionic gonadotropin.
- If TSH is normal or increased and high unbound T4, then TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance syndrome.
- If TSH and unbound T4 normal, then No further tests.
  ]

EVALUATION OF HYPOTHYROIDISM
Measure TSH

[Image Description: A flowchart describing the evaluation of hypothyroidism.
It starts with measuring TSH. There are two initial branches depending on the results: Elevated or Normal.

- If TSH is Elevated, then measure unbound T4.
  - If unbound T4 is Normal, then Mild hypothyroidism. If unbound T4 is Low, then Primary hypothyroidism.
    - If Mild hypothyroidism, then TPOAb+ or symptomatic, or TPOAb-, no symptoms. If TPOAb+ or symptomatic, then T4 treatment. If TPOAb-, no symptoms, then annual follow-up.
    - If Primary hypothyroidism, then TPOAb+ or TPOAb-. If TPOAb+, then autoimmune hypothyroidism and T4 treatment. If TPOAb-, then rule out other causes of hypothyroidism and T4 treatment.
- If TSH is Normal, then Pituitary disease suspected. If No, then No further tests. If Yes, then measure unbound T4. - If unbound T4 is Low, then Rule out drug effects, sick euthyroid syndrome, then evaluate anterior pituitary function. If unbound T4 is Normal, then No further tests.

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials
   _ Baseline to prepare patient for thionamides which can cause agranulocytosis
   ➡LFT
   _ Baseline LFT to prepare patient for thionamides which can cause hepatotoxicity
   ➡Thyroid function test (TFT) \* Do **NOT** use TSH level to monitor response to treatment since it can remain suppressed for several months (use T3 and T4 level instead)

➡Radionuclide scan (Scintigraphy) (<sup>99m</sup>Tc/ <sup>123</sup>I/<sup>131</sup>I)

- **NOT** recommended for routine diagnostic use
- Indicated in patients with a thyroid nodule and↓ TSH level to determine the functional status of nodule
  - ↓ TSH level indicates overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism and radionuclide scan can confirm whether this is due to a thyroid nodule that is hyperfunctioning (**hot**) since it produces thyroid hormones
  - **Hot** nodules do **NOT** require FNAC and the patient is treated according to the management of a toxic adenoma
  - **Cold** nodules require FNAC
  - **NOT** performed in ↔ (euthyroid) or ↑ TSH since the thyroid nodule will never be hyperfunctioning and will require USG ± FNAC to confirm anyways
- Indicated in patients with multinodular goitre (MNG) to determine functional status of different thyroid nodules
  - **Hot** nodules do **NOT** require FNAC
  - **Cold** nodules require FNAC
- Interpretation
  - Hyperfunctioning (**hot**) nodules (uptake is greater than surrounding thyroid tissues) are almost never malignant and hence does **NOT** require FNAC
  - Hypofunctioning (**cold**) nodules (uptake is less than surrounding thyroid tissues) has 10 – 20% of being cancer and hence requires FNAC provided that sonographic criteria are met

2. Management of thyroid storm
   ➡Pathophysiology

- Thyroid storm develops in patients with longstanding untreated hyperthyroidism which is precipitated by acute event such as surgery, trauma or infection
- Rapid↑ in serum thyroid hormone levels leading to increase response to sympathetic inputs from catecholamine (adrenaline / noradrenaline) by permissive effect
- Leads to cardiovascular symptoms including hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, hypertension and followed by heart failure with hypotension and arrhythmia
  ➡General measures
- Correction of hyperthermia with paracetamol (NOT salicylate) and physical cooling
- Correction of dehydration with IV fluid replacement
- Supportive therapy includes O2 supplementation, digoxin or diuretic for congestive heart failure and AF
  ➡Medical treatment
- **Initial regimen:** Propylthiouracil + Hydrocortisone + Propranolol
- **Following regimen** (after 1 hour): Iodide to block thyroid hormone release - Lugol's solution - Sodium iodide (NaI) - Ipodate
  ➡Remarks
- Consider diltiazem if ẞ-blockers are contraindicated
- Consider lithium carbonate (LiCO3) if anti-thyroid drugs are contraindicated
- Consider plasmapheresis and charcoal hemoperfusion in desperate cases

2. Thyroid hormone synthesis

[Diagram illustrating thyroid hormone synthesis. The diagram depicts a thyroid follicular cell with various labeled components and steps in the synthesis process.

1. At the top right, the thyroid follicular cells are visible, with a colloid inside.
2. Labeled components include:
   - Tyrosines (part of thyroglobulin molecule).
   - Golgi apparatus.
   - Lysosome.
   - Rough ER.
   - Capillary.
3. The steps of synthesis are numerically labeled and described:
   - Step 1: Thyroglobulin is synthesized and discharged into the follicle lumen.
   - Step 2: Iodide (I-) is trapped (actively transported in).
   - Step 3: Iodide is oxidized to iodine.
   - Step 4: Iodine is attached to tyrosine in colloid, forming DIT and MIT.
   - Step 5: Iodinated tyrosines are linked together to form T3 and T4.
   - Step 6: Thyroglobulin colloid is endocytosed and combined with a lysosome.
   - Step 7: Lysosomal enzymes cleave T4 and T3 from thyroglobulin and hormones diffuse into bloodstream.
     The diagram also indicates the movement of T3 and T4 to peripheral tissues. Additionally, a note indicates colloid in lumen of follicle.]

(1) Thyroglobulin biosynthesis

- Thyroglobulin is synthesized in ribosomes of follicle cells
- Stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and cAMP
- Thyroglobulin in follicular cells is incorporated into exocytotic vesicles and extruded into colloid in lumen of follicle
  (2) Thyroid hormone biosynthesis
- **Iodide trapping**: Dietary iodide is taken up actively by Na-I symporter
- **Oxidation**: Iodide is oxidize to iodine by thyroidal peroxidase
- **Iodination / Organification**: Tyrosine residue in thyroglobulin is iodinated and form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT)
- **Coupling**: MIT and DIT are coupled together to form T3 and T4
  (3) Secretion of thyroid hormones
- Stimulation of thyroid gland leads to endocytosis of colloid
- Endocytic vesicles fuse with lysosomes inside the follicular cells
- T3 and T4 are cleaved from the thyroglobulin and released into circulation
  (4) Transport of thyroid hormones
- Associate with binding proteins in the circulation
  - Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) (70%)
  - Pre-albumin (15%)
  - Albumin (15%)
  - Free in circulation (< 1%)
- Only free and albumin-bound thyroid hormone is biologically available to tissues

3. Activation and inactivation of TH
   ➡ Deiodination reactions in the peripheral tissues activate and inactivate TH

- Deiodinase Type 1 / 2 / 3 to catalyse the reaction
- Deiodination of T4 into T3 (active) or reverse T3 (inactive)

4. Mechanism of TH action
   ➡ Thyroid hormones receptors (TRs)

- Located in the nuclei of target cells
- Bound to thyroid hormone response elements in DNA
  ➡Mechanism of action
- Cells receive free thyroid hormones (TH) from blood
- T4 is deiodinated to T3 once inside cell
- T3 then enters nucleus and binds to thyroid hormone receptors (TRs)
- T3 triggers the dissociation of corepressor from TRs and binding of coactivator
- TRs and T3 forms a complex with another nuclear receptor known as retinoid X receptor (RxR) to initiate gene transcription
- Results in mRNA and protein production

V. Pathogenesis

1. TSH and growth factors
   ➡Differentiated thyroid carcinoma expresses TSH receptors

- ↑ TSH is associated with increased thyroid cancer risk in patients with thyroid nodules
- Clinical correlation
  - T4 is required for suppression of TSH in patients with thyroid cancer
  - TSH-stimulated uptake of 131I therapy in residual tumour with residual expression of TSH receptors

2. Oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes
   ➡Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway

- Critical to development and progression of thyroid carcinoma
- Activation of RET-RAS-BRAF signalling pathway
  - BRAF mutation
  - RET mutation
  - RAS mutation

_ Thyroid eye-disease
_ Lid retraction_ → Stand behind and look from top of the head
_ Proptosis → Look from the side
_ Chemosis → Stand in front of patient
_ Lid lag_ → Stand in front of patient \* Ophthalmoplegia/ Diplopia → Stand in front of patient

Remarks: _Lid lag and lid retraction are result of excess sympathetic activity and are not specific to Grave's disease whereas the others are specific (Grave's ophthalmopathy)

3. Inspection
   [Image of a person's neck and upper chest, focusing on a surgical scar. The person has fair skin. The scar is horizontal, slightly curved, and located in the lower neck region, just above the collarbone. It appears to be well-healed. The neck is slightly elongated, suggesting the head is tilted back slightly. The background is blurred and out of focus.]
   ➡ Scars

- Thyroidectomy scar - Kocher (collar) incision on anterior aspect of mid-neck
  ➡ Neck swelling
- Ask the patient to swallow and see if the mass moves up with swallowing
  - Mass that moves up with swallowing suggests goitre or thyroglossal cyst
  - Thyroid is enclosed in the pretracheal fascia which is anchored to the trachea and therefore moves up with swallowing
- Ask the patient to protrude his or her tongue - Mass that moves up with tongue protrusion suggests thyroglossal cyst - Thyroglossal cyst are cysts of epithelial remnants of thyroglossal tract - Presents characteristically as a midline neck mass at thyrohyoid membrane closely associated with hyoid bone
  ➡ Overlying skin changes
- Post-irradiation marks

|                       | Localization of mass                                                                                                                                                    |

4. Palpation
   ➡ \*Ask for any **PAIN** before palpation
   ⇨ Lumps

- Ask the patient to swallow again when palpating
- Palpate for the lower border of the thyroid
  - Note any retrosternal extension by palpating the lower border
- Palpate for thrills
- Mass characterization - Size: Estimation of dimension - Site: Central neck mass/ Anterior triangle/ Posterior triangle (L/R) - Consistency: Soft/ Cystic/ Firm/ Hard - Surface: Smooth/ Nodular/ Multinodular - Mobility: Fixed to skin/ Fixed to underlying structures/ Moves with swallowing - Tenderness: Tender/ Non-tender
  ➡Lymphadenopathy
- Discrete, mobile, firm or rubbery but not rocky hard, slightly tender → Reactive LN
- Isolated, asymmetric, tender, warm and erythematous, fluctuant → Infected LN
- Firm, rubbery, rapidly expanding → Rapidly growing lymphoma
- Rock-hard, fixed (invasion through capsule and fixed to underlying structures) and non- tender → Malignancy
  ➡Tracheal deviation

5. Percussion
   ➡ Percuss the sternum and manubrium downwards to upwards

- Normally should be resonant at the sternum
- Dull percussion note indicates retrosternal extension

6. Auscultation
   ➡ Thyroid bruit

- Sign of increased blood flow in hyperthyroidism
- Grave's disease (_typical_)

1003

# VIII. Diagnosis

1. Biochemical tests

   ➡CBC with differentials

   ➡Serum Ca2+ and PO43-
   - Hypercalcemia of malignancy
   - Hypocalcemia due to compromise of parathyroid gland secondary to invasion or complication of thyroidectomy

   ➡Thyroid function test (TFT)
   - Serum TSH level
     - TSH level is the **MOST** sensitive indicator of thyroid function due to short t1/2
   - Serum fT4 and fT3 level

   ➡Thyroid autoantibodies
   - Anti-thyroglobulin (TG) antibodies should be measured to assess whether thyroglobulin can be used as a tumour marker for recurrence after total thyroidectomy

   ➡Serum thyroglobulin level
   - Baseline tumour marker for differentiated thyroid carcinoma

   ➡Serum calcitonin level
   - Baseline tumour marker for differentiated thyroid carcinoma
   - 95% of medullary thyroid carcinoma produces calcitonin

   ➡Serum CEA level
   - Baseline tumour marker for differentiated thyroid carcinoma
   - 80% of medullary thyroid carcinoma produces CEA

   ➡Genetic testing
   - All patients with MTC should be tested for RET mutation
   - Genetical counselling and testing of family members can be offered

1004

2. Radiological tests
   ➡ Ultrasound (USG) of neck

- Identify whether lesion is solid or cystic, solitary or multiple
- Detection of extrathyroidal invasion provides support for diagnosis of cancer
- Identify involvement of local and regional lymph nodes
  - Sonographic features of malignant LN = Large > 2 cm/Roundish (taller than wide)/ Heterogeneous hypoechoic/ Loss of central fatty hilum/ Presence of microcalcification/ Presence of intranodal cystic or coagulative necrosis
- Guides FNA cytology
- Findings that are suspicious for thyroid cancer

[Image of four different types of thyroid nodules. From left to right, the first nodule is labeled "Colloid nodule" and is composed of tightly packed cells with round nuclei and abundant cytoplasm. The second nodule is labeled "Papillary carcinoma" and displays finger-like projections of cells with elongated nuclei and a characteristic "Orphan Annie eye" appearance. The third nodule is labeled "Medullary carcinoma" and shows clusters of cells with granular cytoplasm and amyloid deposits. The fourth nodule is labeled "Anaplastic carcinoma" and exhibits highly pleomorphic cells with bizarre nuclei and frequent mitotic figures.]

➡FNA for cytology

- Core needle biopsy is **NOT** performed
  - Lead to massive bleeding since thyroid is a very vascularized structure
  - FNAC is very accurate in identifying type of thyroid cancer
- Indications
  - Sonographic criteria for FNA
  - Hypofunctioning (**cold**) nodules in thyroid scintigraphy
  - Dominant or atypical nodule in multinodular goitre
  - Nodules associated with abnormal LN

➡ Thyroid scintigraphy

- Determine functional status of a thyroid nodule
- ↓ Serum TSH level indicates overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism which increases the possibility that a thyroid nodule is hyperfunctioning
  - Hyperfunctioning (**hot**) nodules (uptake is greater than surrounding thyroid tissues) are rarely cancer and hence does **NOT** require FNA
  - Hypofunctioning (**cold**) nodules (uptake is less than surrounding thyroid tissues) has 10 – 20% of being cancer and hence requires FNA provided that sonographic criteria are met

1006

⇨CXR

- Tracheal deviation
- Mediastinal shadow for retrosternal extension
  ➡CT thorax
- Determine extent of involvement in retrosternal goitre or thyroid tumour
- Identify tumour invasion of the great vessels and upper aerodigestive tract
  ➡Imaging modalities to detect local invasion
- Bronchoscopy for invasion into trachea
- OGD for invasion into esophagus
  ➡Imaging modalities to detect metastasis
- PET-CT scan
- Use of 18-gluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG)
- CXR
- Presence of lung metastasis
- Skeletal X-ray
- Detect bone metastasis in presence of lytic lesions
- CT/ MRI brain, neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis
  - Identify distant metastasis

1008

➡Total thyroidectomy with post-operative chemoradiotherapy

- Indicated in patients with intrathyroidal anaplastic carcinoma or locally
  advanced disease
- Post-operative combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy prolong survival
  ➡ Chemotherapy
- Indicated in patients with surgically inoperable disease
  ➡Radiotherapy (External beam radiotherapy (EBRT))
- Indicated in patients with surgically inoperable disease
  ➡Tracheostomy
- Death is usually attributable to upper airway obstruction and suffocation and
  tracheostomy is indicated to secure the airway

2. Preoperative preparation
   ➡Anti-thyroid drugs or B-blockers

- Prevention of thyroid storm
  ➡Calcium supplements and vitamin D
- Prevention of postoperative hypocalcemia
- Prevention of hungry bone syndrome (HBS)
  ➡Lugol's solution
- Block iodine uptake and secretion of thyroid hormone
- Decrease vascularity of thyroid gland to reduce intraoperative bleeding

3. Surgical anatomy
   Tubercle of Zuckerkandl

- Pyramidal extension of thyroid gland located on posterior aspect of each lobe
- RLN usually traverses the posterior aspect of the tubercle which helps the surgeon to find
  and identify the nerve
- The tubercle should be carefully elevated and rotated medially to identify the nerve as it
  courses posterior to the tubercle

➡ Lymph node dissection

- Central compartment (Level VI) _VS_ Lateral compartment
  - Normal lymph node metastasis spread from central compartment (CN VI) to the lateral compartment
  - Lymph node dissection for lateral compartment _MUST_ therefore include dissection of central compartment as well

| Prophylactic                                                                     | Modified radical neck dissection                                                                                                                          | Therapeutic | Radical neck dissection                                                                                                          |

| Selective neck dissection ➡Removal of areas with high chance of nodal metastasis | ➡ Removal of level I – V LN ➡ Preservation of one or more of the following _ Internal jugular vein _ Spinal accessory nerve \* Sternocleidomastoid muscle |             | ➡ Removal of all of the following _ Level I – V LN _ Internal jugular vein _ Spinal accessory nerve _ Sternocleidomastoid muscle |

- Selective neck dissection
  - Performed when there is _NO_ clinical evidence of lymph node involvement but the risk of lymph node spread is high in the future
- Modified radical neck _VS_ Radical neck dissection
  - Both carries the same outcomes (recurrence rates) but modified radical neck dissection is associated with a much lower risk of morbidity
  - Radical neck dissection is thus only performed when there is evidence of invasion into the structures (IJV/ CN XI/ SCM)
- Remarks
  - Prophylactic LN dissection is generally performed for H&N cancer when the risk of LN involvement > 15 – 20% depending on the type of tumour and TNM staging

5. Complications of thyroidectomy

| Classification             | Complications            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Immediate (Intraoperative) | ➡Intraoperative bleeding |

➡Esophageal injury
➡Tracheal injury
➡Tracheomalacia
➡ Thyroid storm

- Thyroid storm develops in patients with longstanding untreated hyperthyroidism which is precipitated by acute event such as surgery, trauma or infection
- Rapid↑ in serum thyroid hormone levels leading to increase response to sympathetic inputs from catecholamine (adrenaline / noradrenaline) by permissive effect
- Leads to cardiovascular symptoms including hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, hypertension and followed by heart failure with hypotension and arrhythmia |
  | | ➡ Superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) injury
- SLN supplies the cricothyroid muscle which lengthens (tense) the vocal cord to produces high-pitched sound
- Presents with vocal fatigue and changes in voice quality
  | | ➡Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury
- RLN supplies all intrinsic muscles of larynx except cricothyroid
- ↑ Risk of aspiration pneumonia
- Ipsilateral RLN injury
  - Unilateral vocal cord palsy
  - Presents with hoarseness and ineffective cough
- Bilateral RLN injury - Bilateral vocal cord palsy - Presents with stridor and dyspnea (airway obstruction) |
  | Early | ➡Hematoma formation
- Potentially fatal if compression on airways
- Removal of stiches and allow drainage of blood
  | | ➡Wound infection |
  | Late | ➡Recurrence
  ➡ Hypertrophic scar and keloid formation
  ➡Hypoparathyroidism leading to hypocalcemia
- **MOST** common complication
- Check serum corrected Ca2+ level or PTH level postoperatively
- Presents with symptoms of hypocalcemia including perioral and acral paraesthesia, carpopedal spasm, muscle spasms and cramps, Trousseau's sign and Chvostek's sign
- Management - **Fast replacement:** IV 10-20 mL of 10% calcium gluconate over 10 mins (slow bolus) - **Replacement:** Calcium carbonate + Calcitriol (Vitamin D)
  ➡Hungry bone syndrome leading to hypocalcemia
- **Definition:** Severe and prolonged hypocalcemia despite normal or even elevated levels of PTH
- Exacerbated by suppressed PTH levels
- Associated with hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia
- Pathogenesis
  - Sudden removal of effect of high circulating levels of PTH
  - Leads to increased influx of calcium into bones

1011

6. Thyroid hormone replacement
   ➡Rationale

- Prevent hypothyroidism and maintain euthyroidism
- Suppress TSH to prevent stimulation of tumour growth
  ➡Hemithyroidectomy
- Do **NOT** start T4 therapy immediately postoperatively
- Measure serum TSH 6 weeks after surgery and determine the need for T4 based upon
  TSH and evaluation of postoperative disease status
  ➡Total thyroidectomy
- Depends on the need of RAI ablation
- Patients who do **NOT** need RAI ablation
  - Start T4 therapy immediately postoperatively
- Patients who require RAI ablation and **CAN** tolerate prolong hypothyroidism
  - Withhold T4 therapy and stop 4 weeks prior to RAI ablation
- Patients who require RAI ablation and **CANNOT** tolerate prolong hypothyroidism - Start T3 therapy which has a shorter t1/2 and stop for 2 weeks prior to RAI
  ablation - Recombinant human TSH injection
  ➡Precautions
- Osteoporosis → Calcium supplements required
- Atrial fibrillation (AF) and cardiac dysfunction → May withhold treatment

1012

7. Radioactive iodine (RAI) (I¹³¹) ablation
   ➡ Rationale

- Ablate remaining normal thyroid tissue (remnant ablation)
- Treatment of clinical apparent residual thyroid cancer (residual tumour ablation)
- Treatment of subclinical micrometastasis
- Treatment of metastatic thyroid cancer

➡Indications of RAI ablation after total thyroidectomy

| Risk         | RAI ablation | Description                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

|              |              | ➡ Multifocal cancer when all foci are < 1 cm and without high-risk features |
| Intermediate | Selected     | ➡Intrathyroidal cancer 1 – 4 cm without high-risk features                  |
|              |              | ➡ Vascular invasion                                                         |
|              |              | ➡ Microscopic invasion into perithyroidal soft tissues                      |

➡ Before RAI ablation

- Low iodine diet for ≥ 1-2 weeks
- Withdrawal of T4 for ≥ 4 weeks or T3 for ≥ 2 weeks
  - Allow increase in TSH production by pituitary
  - Promote RAI uptake by the residual tumour
- Recombinant human TSH injection
  - Indicated for those who cannot tolerate prolong hypothyroidism (CVS disease)
  - Promote RAI uptake by the residual tumour

➡ After RAI ablation

- Avoid pregnancy for 1 year until disease becomes stable
- Post-therapy RAI scan
- Start TSH suppression therapy
  - Supra-physiological dose of thyroxine (T4)
  - TSH level to inhibit tumour growth

[Image Description: The image is a table describing the types, defective genes, and descriptions of the conditions MEN1, MEN2A, and MEN2B. MEN1's defective gene is MEN1 encoding MENIN, and its description includes pancreatic endocrine tumor, pituitary tumor (prolactinoma), and parathyroid hyperplasia. MEN2A and MEN2B both have RET as their defective gene. MEN2A's description includes medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma. MEN2B's description includes parathyroid hyperplasia, medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuroma or intestinal ganglioneuroma.]

[Image Description: The image presents a table that shows the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on Calcium (Ca2+) and Phosphate (PO43-) levels in different parts of the body, namely kidneys, intestines, and bones. For kidneys it shows that PTH leads to increased reabsorption of Ca2+ in the distal tubules and an increase in urinary excretion of Ca2+. Also, PTH promotes the reabsorption of PO43- in the proximal tubules and increased urinary excretion of PO43-. In the intestines, PTH increases intestinal Ca2+ absorption through the up regulation of Vitamin D3 1α-hydroxylase, formation of Vitamin D (calcitriol) in the kidneys, and increased intestinal Ca2+ absorption via Vitamin D. Bones respond to PTH with bone resorption (continuous high level), which activates osteoblasts and promotes proliferation of osteoclasts, and with bone formation (intermittent low dose), which has an anabolic action with an increase in bone mineral density. The image also states that Teriparatide activates PTH hormone receptors in bone and is used to treat osteoporosis.]

2. Clinical manifestation of hyperparathyroidism
   (Classical = **Bones** + **Stones** + **Abdominal moans** + **Psychic groans**)

[Image Description: This image contains a compilation of x-ray images illustrating the skeletal manifestations of hyperparathyroidism.

The top left image, labeled 'A,' shows the hand with radial margin of proximal and middle phalanges bilaterally frayed, irregular and lace-like due to subperiosteal resorption, indicated by arrows. Osteolysis of distal phalanges (large arrowhead) and presence of brown tumours (small arrowhead) are also visible.

The top right contains two head x-rays, the one on the left labeled 'A' shows a skull exhibiting a 'salt-and-pepper' appearance, indicating bone resorption. The x-ray on the right, labeled 'B,' displays a normal skull for comparison.

The bottom row contains x-ray images of clavicles, labeled 'B.' The image on the left shows subchondral resorption on both distal clavicles with an arrow. On the right there is another x-ray showing clavicles with an arrow pointing to subchondral resorption on both distal clavicles.]

➡ Bones diseases

- Osteopenia (↓ Bone mineral density (BMD))
  - ↑ Osteoclastic activity and bone resorption
  - Osteoclasts erode bone matrix and mobilize Ca2+
  - Formation of new bone matrix
  - Prone to osteoporosis and fractures
- Osteitis fibrosa cystica
  - High bone turnover due to hyperparathyroidism
  - Characterized clinically by bone pain and radiographically by subperiosteal bone resorption on radial aspect of middle phalanges, tapering of distal clavicles, "salt-and-pepper" appearance of skull, bone cyst and brown tumours of long bones
- Brown tumours
  - Advanced stage of osteitis fibrosa cystica in which there is formation of bone cysts and hemorrhagic elements so that they appear brown in color
  - Result from excess osteoclast activity and consist of collections of osteoclasts intermixed with fibrous tissue and poorly mineralized woven bone with a brown color due to hemosiderin deposition
  - Must **NOT** be mistaken as a neoplasm or confused with osteosarcoma

➡ Nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis

- Nephrolithiasis refers to renal or ureteric stones
- Nephrocalcinosis refers to generalized deposition of Ca2+ in the kidney parenchyma and tubules causing acute or chronic renal failure

➡Neuropsychiatric disturbances

- Presents with lethargy, depressed mood, psychosis, decreased social interaction and cognitive dysfunction

➡ Serum Ca2+, PO43- level
➡ Urine Ca2+ level (24-hour urinary Ca²+ excretion)

- ↑ Urine Ca2+ level in primary hyperthyroidism
- ↓ Urine Ca2+ level is familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)
  ➡ Serum PTH level
  ➡ Serum ALP level
- Markers of bone turnover and not routinely required
  ➡ Serum calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) level
- Evaluate for vitamin D deficiency as a cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism
- NOT serum calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) as the body respond to vitamin D deficiency by increasing hydroxylation from calcidiol to calcitriol
- Hyperparathyroidism is more active when subject are vitamin D insufficient
- Corrected levels of vitamin D can lead to decrease in PTH levels
  ➡ Renal function test (RFT)
- Plasma urea and creatinine level
- eGFR

2. Radiological tests
   ➡Localization studies

- **NOT** used in diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism **NOR** determine the need of surgery
- Indicated **ONLY** when primary hyperparathyroidism is confirmed with biochemical tests and decision of surgery is made
  - Guide operative approach and determine whether or not the patient is a candidate for a minimally-invasive approach and focused parathyroidectomy
  - Accurate localization can aid in limiting the dissection to the region where the adenoma is localized and use of intraoperative PTH assay should be used to confirm no other hyperfunctioning glands remains in-situ by demonstrating substantial drop in PTH level
- USG neck
  - Sonographic features include homogeneous hypoechogenicity and an extra-thyroidal feeding vessel with peripheral vascularity on Doppler imaging
- 99m Tc-Sestamibi scintigraphy
  - Concentrate in parathyroid adenoma
  - Negative Sestamibi scan does not preclude the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism since it can be unrevealing in parathyroid hyperplasia, multiple parathyroid adenoma or in coexisting thyroid disease
- MRI scan
  - Low intensity signal on T1 imaging and high intensity signal on T2 imaging
- PET scan
  - Use of 11C-methionine as a radiotracer to identify pathologic parathyroid gland
- Selective venous sampling (_invasive_)
  - Reserved for patients who have prior neck surgery or unrevealing non-invasive tests
  - Most common invasive modality use for parathyroid localization
  - 1.5 – 2 x increased in PTH levels obtained from representative cervical vein drainage location (superior/middle/inferior thyroid, thymic, vertebral veins) compared to a peripheral location is considered abnormal
- Selective arteriography (_invasive_) - Reserved for patients who have prior neck surgery or unrevealing non-invasive tests - Performed by combing selective transarterial hypocalcemic stimulation with non-selective venous sampling - Injection of sodium citrate to induce hypocalcemia while simultaneous arteriography is performed and obtain baseline and timed SVC sampling - Positive localization is considered when there is an increase in PTH to 1.4 x the baseline or a blush is seen on arteriography
  ➡Investigations to screen for complications
- KUB
  - Assess for nephrolithiasis
- USG kidneys
  - Assess for nephrocalcinosis
- DEXA scan
  - Measurement of BMD to diagnose osteopenia and osteoporosis
  - Predict risk of osteoporotic fracture
  - Bones measured including hip, femoral neck, lumbar spine and distal 1/3 radius
  - Osteoporosis is defined as a T-score < -2.5

V. Treatment

1. Medical treatment
   ➡Correction of hypercalcemia

- Saline hydration is used as initial therapy
- Loop diuretics should be used in patients with heart failure or renal insufficiency to prevent fluid overload
- Calcitonin can be used as immediate short-term management of hypercalcemia
- Bisphosphonates can be used as long-term management of hypercalcemia in patients who is due to excessive bone resorption
  ➡Calcimimetics
- Mimics action of Ca²+ on tissues by acting on Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR) which can effectively lower serum Ca2+ level
- Indicated in severe hypercalcemic patients whom parathyroidectomy is indicated but clinically not a good surgical candidate

2. Surgery treatment
   ➡ Indications

- **ALL** symptomatic patients
- Asymptomatic patients with the following features
  - Age < 50
  - Serum Ca2+ is 0.25 mmol/L (1 mg/dL) above ULN
  - Hypercalciuria (24-hour urinary Ca2+ excretion > 400 mg/dL)
  - Creatinine clearance ↓ by ≥ 30% (GFR < 60 mL/min)
  - Nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis
  - Osteoporosis (DEXA scan < -2.5)
- Persistent or recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism
- Familial primary hyperparathyroidism
- Parathyroid cancer
- Parathyroid crisis
  ➡ Contraindications
- Known recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury
  - Bilateral RLN injury can be life-threatening
- Symptomatic cervical disc disease
- Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)
  - Patient does not have primary hyperparathyroidism
  - Surgical intervention does not result in cure

1022

➡Focused parathyroidectomy (Minimally invasive parathyroid surgery)

- Less time, less dissection, lower cost, smaller incision but equal success rate when compared with a bilateral neck exploration
- Requires preoperative localization
  - Accurate localization can aid in limiting the dissection to the region where the adenoma is localized and
- Requires intraoperative PTH assay
  - Takes advantage of the short t1/2 of PTH = 3 - 5 mins
  - Use of intraoperative PTH assay should be used to confirm no other hyperfunctioning glands remains in-situ by demonstrating substantial drop in PTH level
  - Dual criteria: Intraoperative PTH assay with fall of > 50% after removal in 10 mins and has returned to normal range (comparing pre-skin-incision level and 10 mins post-gland-excision level)

➡Bilateral exploration

- Indicated when preoperative localization imaging is unrevealing or in patients with multigland disease
- Total parathyroidectomy
  - Safe and effective approach
  - Highest risk of permanent hypocalcemia and thus should be reserved for patients who suffer from severe complications of hyperparathyroidism
- Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation
  - Removes all parathyroid glands that can be identified and autotransplant a small portion of gland into non-dominant forearm
  - Autotransplantation into forearm allows re-exploration to be carried out easily under LA in cases of recurrent hyperparathyroidism
  - Autotransplantation also provides ability to evaluate graft function and detect graft failure by testing the gradient between PTH level in ipsilateral and contralateral forearm vein
  - Potential of profound hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia if autograft fails and can be countered by autotransplantation of a cryopreserved parathyroid tissue if available
  - ↓ Risk of permanent hypocalcemia
  - ↑ Risk of persistent hyperparathyroidism
  - Lower recurrence of hyperparathyroidism and better symptom improvement than subtotal parathyroidectomy
- Subtotal parathyroidectomy
  - Resection of 3.5 glands and preserve 50 – 80 mg of vascularized gland
  - Risk of reoperation in the neck when recurrent hyperparathyroidism develops
  - ↓ Risk of permanent hypocalcemia
  - ↑ Risk of persistent hyperparathyroidism
- Cervical thymectomy
  - Performed usually in both total and subtotal parathyroidectomy due to possibility of supernumerary gland or ectopic PTH gland
  - Important for patient with a missing inferior parathyroid gland or with supernumerary glands since it is most likely located in one of the intrathymic locations and it serves as the source of persistent or recurrent disease

VI. **Case study**

Case 1

A 48-year-old woman presented to her general practitioner with low back pain for one week. She had no other
complaint. X-ray of lumbar spine revealed normal inter-vertebral disc spaces but osteopenia more advanced
than expected for her age. The doctor suspected secondary osteoporosis and ordered some investigations.
Preliminary results showed a mildly elevated serum total Ca2+ of 2.77 mmol/L, and a raised serum PTH level of
89 pg/mL. Other investigations were normal.

Q1: What are the most common causes of hypercalcemia?

➡ 2 Most common causes

- Hyperparathyroidism
- Hypercalcemia of malignancy (secretion of PTH-like peptide)
  ➡Less common causes
- Excess intake of vitamin D or calcium
- Hyperthyroidism
- Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia
- TB
- Sarcoidosis

Q2: What investigations would you perform in a patient presenting with hypercalcemia?

➡Serum albumin, phosphate, PTH, alkaline phosphatase (ALP)

- ↑ PTH, ↑ Ca2+, ↓ PO4 suggests hyperparathyroidism
- ↓PTH, ↑ Ca2+ suggests hypercalcemia of malignancy
  ➡24-hour urinary Ca²+ excretion
  ⇨ RFT

# Endocrine Diseases

## Pituitary adenoma

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Pituitary adenomas are benign tumours of the anterior pituitary
   ➡Sellar masses typically presents in the following ways
   - Neurological symptoms (Visual impairment/ Headache)
   - Hormonal abnormalities (Excess/ Deficiency)
   - Incidental findings on MRI performed for other reasons
2. Classification of pituitary adenoma
   ➡Classification by size
   - Microadenoma < 1 cm
   - Macroadenoma > 1 cm
     ➡Classification by functionality
   - Functional adenoma
   - NON-functional adenoma - Non-functional adenomas usually present with hypopituitarism due to compression of normal (non-adenomatous) pituitary tissues - 70-90% of non-functioning adenoma are gonadotroph adenoma making them the most common type of pituitary macroadenoma - Since gonadotroph adenoma are generally hormone inefficiency and thus by the time it produces supranormal serum concentration of gonadotropins or their subunits it is already a macroadenoma
     ➡Classification by cell of origin
   - Lactotroph adenoma = ↑ Prolactin secretion
     - Leads to hypogonadism in males and females
   - Somatotroph adenoma = ↑ GH secretion
     - Leads to acromegaly
   - Corticotroph adenoma = ↑ ACTH secretion
     - Leads to Cushing's syndrome
   - Thyrotroph adenoma = ↑ TSH secretion/ NON-functioning sellar mass
     - Secretes TSH = Hyperthyroidism
     - Secretes only a or ẞ subunits = NON-functioning sellar mass
   - Gonadotroph adenoma = NON-functioning sellar mass
     - Although gonadotroph adenomas are considered to be non-functioning most do product intact gonadotropins or their subunits
       - Hormones produced in descending order of frequency = FSH/ FSH-β/ α-subunit/ LH/ LH-B
     - α-subunit is not biologically active and does not result in clinical symptoms due to its secretion but is measured to evaluate patients with sellar masses to determine if mass is pituitary in origin
     - Adenomas are typically poorly differentiated and inefficient secretors and od not raise serum gonadotropins concentration in most cases
     - Adenomas that raise gonadotropin levels in 35% typically do NOT result in a clinical syndrome except in rare cases causing precocious puberty or ovarian hyperstimulation
   - Lactotroph/ Somatotroph adenoma (10%)
     - Well-recognized and cause clinical syndromes of both hormones

1026

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡Pituitary adenomas are the most common causes of sellar mass from 3rd decades onwards
   accounting for up to 10% of intracranial neoplasms
   ➡Prevalence of different types of pituitary adenoma (descending order of frequency)

- Lactotroph adenoma\* >
- Non-functioning adenoma (25-35%) >
- Somatotroph adenoma >
- Corticotroph adenoma

III. Etiology

1. Differential diagnosis of sellar mass
   ➡Pituitary hyperplasia

- Lactotroph hyperplasia = Pregnancy
- Thyrotroph hyperplasia = Longstanding primary hypothyroidism
- Gonadotroph hyperplasia = Longstanding primary hypogonadism
- Somatotroph hyperplasia = Ectopic secretion of GH-releasing hormones
  ➡Benign tumours
- Craniopharyngioma
- Meningioma
- Pituicytoma
  ➡Malignant tumours
- Primary tumours
  - Pituitary carcinoma (rare)
  - Germ cell tumours (Pineal gland tumours)
  - Chordomas
  - CNS lymphoma
- Secondary tumours - CA lung in males - CA breast in females
  ➡Cysts
- Rathke's cysts
- Arachnoid cysts
- Dermoid cysts
  ➡Pituitary abscess
  ➡Lymphocytic hypophysitis
  ➡Carotid arteriovenous fistula

IV. Pathogenesis

1. Anatomical correlation
   Cavernous sinus

[Image Description: This is an anatomical illustration of a coronal section through the cavernous sinus and pituitary gland. The optic chiasm is at the top, with the internal carotid artery labeled to the right, above the pituitary gland. The sphenoid sinus is below the pituitary gland, with the nasopharynx highlighted in a green box below that. The cranial nerves III, IV, VI, V1 and V2 are labeled around the cavernous sinus.]

V. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Visual defects

- Most common symptoms present in patients with NON-functioning adenoma
- Caused by suprasellar extension of adenoma leading to compression of optic chiasm
- Bitemporal hemianopia is the most common compliant
- Diminished visual acuity (VA) occurs when optic chiasm is more severely compressed
  ➡Neurological symptoms
- Headache
  - Presumably caused by expansion of the sella
  - No distinguishing characteristics although they are usually diffuse
- Diplopia
  - Result of compression of oculomotor nerve (CN III) resulting from lateral extension of pituitary adenoma
- CN palsy
- CSF rhinorrhea - Caused by inferior extension of pituitary adenoma which is an extremely uncommon presentation
  ➡Hormonal excess
  ➡Hormonal deficiency
- Due to compression of normal (non-adenomatous) pituitary cells by macroadenoma leading to hypopituitarism
- Most common pituitary hormone deficiency are of gonadotropins which results in hypogonadism in both males and females
- Features in males (Testicular hypofunction) (↓ Testosterone secretions)
  - Gynecomastia/ Galactorrhea
  - Decreased size of penis, testis and scrotum
  - Decreased libido/ Impotence/ Infertility
  - Decreased muscle mass
  - Decreased axillary, pubic and body hair
  - Osteoporosis
- Features in females (Ovarian hypofunction) (↓ Estradiol secretions) - Galactorrhea - Impaired breast development - Infertility - Oligomenorrhea/ Amenorrhea - Osteoporosis
  [Image Description: The page contains text describing clinical manifestations, including signs and symptoms related to visual defects, neurological symptoms, hormonal excess, and hormonal deficiency. It lists specific symptoms associated with each category, such as headache, diplopia, CN palsy, CSF rhinorrhea, gynecomastia, decreased libido, galactorrhea, impaired breast development, and osteoporosis.]

# VI. Diagnosis

1. Biochemical tests

   ➡Hormonal evaluation
   - Lactotroph adenoma = Serum prolactin level
   - Somatotroph adenoma = Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)
   - Corticotroph adenoma = 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion
   - Thyrotroph adenoma = TSH, fT3 and fT4 level
   - Gonadotroph adenoma = Serum LH and FSH level and a-subunits

2. Radiological tests

   ➡ MRI pituitary
   - Single best imaging procedure for most sellar masses and there is usually no need to perform any other imaging study
   - If a sellar lesion can be seen as separate from the normal pituitary gland this indicates that the mass is **NOT** a pituitary adenoma
   - Gadolinium-enhanced image
     - Normal pituitary tissue takes up gadolinium to a greater degree than CNS tissue and therefore has a higher-intensity signal than the surrounding CNS
     - Pituitary adenomas and other sellar masses such as craniopharyngiomas and meningiomas usually take up gadolinium to a lesser degree than the normal pituitary but more than the CNS
     - AVOID in patients with moderate to advanced renal failure (eGFR < 30) since administration of gadolinium has been associated with the potentially severe syndrome of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis

➡ CT scan

- Calcification in a craniopharyngioma or meningioma is seen better by CT scan than by MRI

1030

VII. Treatment

1. Conservative treatment
   ➡Indicated in patients with pituitary adenoma < 1 cm without mass or hormonal effect
   ➡Managed with FU every 3 - 6 months
2. Medical treatment
   ➡Dopamine agonists

- 1st line treatment for patients with hyperprolactinemia of any cause including lactotroph adenoma of any size
- Side effects include nausea, orthostatic hypotension and nasal congestion
- Example: Cabergoline/ Bromocriptine
  - Cabergoline is preferred due to its efficacy (70 – 100% success rate) and favourable side effect profile (as it causes less nausea than bromocriptine)

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡Transsphenoidal/ Transfrontal surgery

- Indications
  - Macroadenoma > 1 cm in size
  - Symptomatic patients especially with visual disturbances
  - Hemorrhage in pituitary adenoma
  - Patients refractory or intolerable to medical treatment
  - Women with giant lactotroph adenoma > 3 cm who wish to become pregnancy even if responding to dopamine agonist (discontinuation of dopamine agonist during pregnancy may lead to increase in size of adenoma to be clinically important before delivery)
- Postoperative radiation
  - **NOT** all adenoma tissue can be excised particularly those with macroadenoma
  - Tends to be conservative during surgery and minimize damage to surrounding structures including the non-adenomatous pituitary
  - Primarily used to prevent regrowth of residual tumour in patient with large macroadenoma after transspehnoidal debulking
- Complications
  - Panhypopituitarism (may require lifelong hormonal replacement)
  - Diabetes insipidus
  - CSF leakage (rhinorrhea)
    - Occurs in 0.5 – 4%
    - If lumbar subarachnoid diversion is unsuccessful in allowing the leak to heal, then reoperation for repacking of the adenoma bed is required
    - Failure to stop CSF leakage increases risk of meningitis
  - Damage to parasellar structures
    - Internal carotid artery
    - Optic chiasm or optic nerves

IV. Pathophysiology

1. Pathophysiology
   ➡ Fractionated catecholamine = Epinephrine + Norepinephrine + Dopamine
   ➡ Fractionated metanephrine = Metanephrine + Normetanephrine
   ➡ Metabolism of circulating catecholamine

- Metabolized predominantly extra-neuronally to o-methylated derivative by catecholamine-o-methyl transferase (COMT)
- Methylated catecholamine are deaminated and oxidized to vanillylmandelic acid which is excreted in urine
  ➡ Actions of a and ß-adrenergic receptors

| a₁-receptor                                                            | a2-receptor                                         | Adrenoreceptors | β₁-receptor                                                     | β₂-receptor                                                                                              |

2. Anatomy of adrenals
   ➡ **Arterial** supply

- Superior adrenal artery (from inferior phrenic artery)
- Middle adrenal artery (from aorta)
- Inferior adrenal artery (from renal artery)
  ➡ **Venous** drainage
- Left adrenal vein (drains into left renal vein)
- Right adrenal vein (drains into IVC directly)

1033

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Classical triad (**Tachycardia** + **Generalized sweating** + **Headache**)
   ➡ 5Ps of Phaeochromocytoma

- **P**ressure (BP: Sustained or paroxysmal hypertension)
- **P**allor
- **P**alpitations (Tachycardia)
- **P**erspiration (Generalized sweating)
- **P**ain (Headache/ Chest pain)
  ➡ Other symptoms
- Dyspnea
- Tremor
- Generalized weakness
- Weight loss (hypermetabolism)
- Glucose intolerance

VI. **Diagnosis**

1. Biochemical tests
   ➡ Urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA)
   ➡ 24-hour urinary fractionated catecholamine and metanephrine

- Preparation before urine collection
  - Avoid dietary intake of caffeine, chocolate and bananas before the test
  - Avoid usage of drugs such as methyldopa, labetalol, sotalol which can create false positive (FP) results
  - Urine specimen should be kept refrigerated during collection till hospital
- Components of tests - ↑ Epinephrine > 35 mcg/24 hours - ↑ Norepinephrine > 170 mcg/24 hours - ↑ Dopamine > 700 mcg/24 hours - ↑ **Metanephrine** > 400 mcg/24 hours (most sensitive) - ↑ Normetanephrine > 900 mcg/24 hours
  ➡ Plasma fractionated metanephrine - ↑ Metanephrine and normetanephrine

2. Radiological tests
   ➡ CT/MRI abdomen and pelvis

- CT is preferred over MRI due to the superior spatial resolution of CT in thorax, abdomen and pelvis
  ➡ Meta-iodo-benzyl guanidine (MIBG) scan
- MIBG is taken up by chromaffin tissues
- Indicated if CT abdomen and pelvis are -ve in the presence of clinical and biochemical evidence of phaeochromocytoma
  ➡ PET scan (FDG-PET)
- More sensitive for detection of metastatic diseases

1034

VII. Treatment

1. Adrenalectomy
   ➡ General approach

- Laparoscopic transabdominal/ Retroperitoneal approach
  ➡ Preoperative preparation
- Aims and objectives
  - Control hypertension and tachycardia to prevent intraoperative hypertensive crisis
  - Volume expansion
- Combined a- and ẞ-blocker to control BP to prevent hypertensive crisis
  - a-blocker should be given **10 - 14 days before operation** for adequate blockade to normalize BP and expand the contracted blood volume
  - ẞ-blocker should be given **2-3 days before operation** after adequate a-blockade has been achieved to relieve the tachycardia caused by a-blocker
  - **NEVER** start ẞ-blocker first since blockade of peripheral vasodilatory ẞ-adrenergic receptors will lead to vasoconstriction with unopposed a-adrenergic activity (when a-blocker is not started) will further elevate the BP
  - BP targets: < 120/80 when seated and SBP > 90 mmHg on standing
  - a-blocker = Phenoxybenzamine _(non-selective and long-acting)_/ Doxazosin/ Terazosin/ Prazosin
    - Side effects: Postural hypotension/ Palpitations\* _(reflex tachycardia)_/ Flushing/ Nasal congestion
  - ẞ-blocker = Propranolol _(non-selective)_
    ➡ Complications
- Acute hypertensive crisis
- Cardiac arrhythmia
- Intraoperative hemorrhage
- Liver or spleen injury
- Pneumothorax

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

## Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) and Esophageal atresia (EA)

### Overview

1. General features
   - TEF and EA are caused by a defect in the lateral septation of foregut into esophagus and trachea
   - Fistula tract is derived from a branch of embryonic lung bud that fails to undergo branching because of defective epithelial-mesenchymal interactions

2. Classification of TEF and EA according to anatomical configuration

[Image: A diagram illustrating five types of esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula. The title of the diagram is "Esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula (88% of cases)".

- Type A: Esophageal atresia without tracheoesophageal fistula, depicted as a blind upper esophageal pouch and a separate lower esophagus leading to the stomach, with no connection between the two. Percentage: (8%).

- Type B: Esophageal atresia with proximal tracheoesophageal fistula, shown as a blind lower esophageal pouch with a connection to the trachea, and a separate upper esophagus leading to the stomach. Percentage: (1%).

- Type C: Esophageal atresia with distal tracheoesophageal fistula, depicted as a blind upper esophageal pouch and a lower esophagus connected to the trachea, leading to the stomach. Percentage: (84%).

- Type D: Esophageal atresia with proximal and distal tracheoesophageal fistula, shown as both the upper and lower esophageal pouches connected to the trachea, with the lower esophagus leading to the stomach. Percentage: (3%).

- Type E: Tracheoesophageal fistula without esophageal atresia (H-type), depicted as a continuous esophagus with a fistula connecting it to the trachea. Percentage: (4%).]

3. Associated conditions

     - **A**nal atresia
     - **C**ardiac defect
     - **T**E fistula (tracheoesophageal fistula)
     - **R**enal defect
     - **L**imb defect

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   - Male predominance

III. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   - Coughing
   - Choking
   - Drooling of saliva
   - Respiratory distress
   - Inability to feed

1036

IV. Diagnosis

1. History taking
   ➡Maternal history

- Polyhydramnios
  - Esophageal atresia (EA) is associated with polyhydramnios in 2/3 of pregnancies

2. Radiological tests
   ➡ Chest X-ray

- Catheter is attempted to pass into the stomach and the catheter cannot be passed further than approximately 10 - 15 cm in affected infants
- AP view of CXR will demonstrates the catheter curled in the upper esophageal pouch (arrest of orogastric tube)
- Presence of stomach gas indicates tracheoesophageal fistula (TOF)
- Gasless abdomen indicates pure esophageal atresia (EA)
  ➡Water-soluble contrast swallow
- Water-soluble contrast can be passed into the esophageal pouch under fluoroscopic guidance which will confirm presence of EA
  - Barium is **NOT** used since it will cause pneumonitis if aspirated into lungs

V. Treatment

1. Surgical treatment
   ➡Treatment for tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF)

- Division and surgical ligation of the fistula
  ➡Treatment for esophageal atresia (EA)
- Primary repair and anastomosis of esophageal segments (short gap)
- Staged procedures if distance between esophageal segments is large (long gap) - Elongation of esophagus - Interposition of jejunum or colon - Gastric transposition
  ➡ Complications
- Anastomotic leak
- Esophageal stricture
- Recurrent fistula
- Tracheomalacia

VI. Complication

1. Complications of TEF and EA
   ➡Aspiration pneumonia

- Reflux of gastric contents through TEF result in aspiration pneumonia and contributes to morbidity
  ➡ Asthma
  ➡ Dysphagia
  ➡ GERD
  ➡Barrett's esophagus

# Gastrointestinal Diseases

# Meckel's diverticulum

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ MOST common congenital anomaly of the GIT
   ➡Results from incomplete obliteration of the vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct leading to formation of a true diverticulum of the small intestine

- True diverticulum containing all layers of small bowel wall
- Arise from the anti-mesenteric surface of middle-to-distal ileum
  ➡Asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is discovered during abdominal exploration for evaluation of unrelated pathology or found incidentally on diagnostic imaging
  ➡Symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum presents with abdominal pain or symptoms of GI bleeding or bowel obstruction

2. "Rule of 2"
   ➡Occurs in approximately 2% of population
   ➡Male-to-Female ratio = 2:1
   ➡Located within 2 feet from ileocecal (IC) valve
   ➡Measured to be 2 inches in length
   ➡2-4% of patients develop complication over the course of their lives typically before age of 2
   ➡Lines by 2 different types of mucosa

- Native intestinal mucosa
- Heterotopic mucosa from gastric (most common), pancreatic, duodenal or colonic mucosa

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡Meckel's diverticulum is uncommon and often clinically silent particularly for the adult

1038

# III. Pathogenesis

1. Anatomy and embryology

[Image: A series of anatomical diagrams illustrating different types of vitelline duct remnants. From left to right:

1.  Vitelline fistula: A complete opening connecting the umbilicus to the ileum.
2.  Fibrous band (cord): A fibrous connection between the umbilicus and the ileum.
3.  Meckel's diverticulum: A small pouch protruding from the ileum.
4.  Vitelline duct cyst: A cyst located along the course of the vitelline duct, not connected to either the umbilicus or the ileum.
5.  Umbilical polyp: A growth located at the umbilicus.]

➡ Vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct

- Vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct connects midgut to yolk sac in fetus
- Normally involutes between 5th and 6th week of gestation as the bowel settles into its permanent position within the abdominal cavity
  ➡ Persistence of vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct beyond fetal development result in different omphalomesenteric duct anomalies
- Patent complete remnant = Vitelline fistula
  - Vitelline duct directly connects umbilicus to terminal ileum
  - Leads to intestinal drainage from umbilicus
- Non-patent complete remnant = Fibrous band (cord)
  - Persistent fibrous cord between umbilicus and ileum
  - Can lead to small bowel obstruction
- Proximal duct persistence = Meckel's diverticulum
  - Persistent tissues at ileum with no connection to umbilicus
- Mid-duct persistence = Vitelline duct cyst
  - Patent mid-duct with closure at both umbilical and ileal ends of vitelline duct
  - Can lead to small bowel obstruction if loops of bowel twist around the cyst
- Distal duct persistence = Umbilical polyp - Firm mass comprised of intestinal epithelium as vitelline duct remnants
  ➡ Meckel's diverticulum
- Rich blood supply to diverticulum is provided by the vitelline artery which is a branch of superior mesenteric artery (SMA)

1039

IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Symptoms related to lower GI bleeding

- Meckel's diverticulum that contain ectopic gastric mucosa are generally associated with bleeding
  - Caused by ulceration of small bowel from acid secretion by the ectopic gastric mucosa within the diverticulum
- Usually painless unless complicated by intestinal obstruction or Meckel's diverticulitis
- Presents as hematochezia in children
- Presents as melena in adults attributable to the slow colonic transit time
  ➡Symptoms related to intestinal obstruction (IO)
- Intussusception
  - Meckel's diverticulum can serve as a lead point for development of intussusception
- Volvulus
  - Small bowel can twist around the fibrous cord or band often associated with Meckel's diverticulum
- Presents as abdominal pain, abdominal distension, vomiting and constipation

V. Diagnosis

1. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials

- Leukocytosis in perforated Meckel's diverticulum
  ➡ Electrolyte profile
- Hyponatremia due to vomiting
  - Loss of Na+ and water from gastric secretions in severe vomiting
- Hypokalemia due to vomiting - Metabolic alkalosis increases plasma HCO3 concentration which rises above the resorptive threshold and the increased NaHCO3 are delivered to distal K+ secretory site which increases urinary K+ secretion (urinary potassium wasting) - Metabolic alkalosis also shifts K+ into cells in exchange for H+ into bloodstream - Hypovolemia-associated activation of RAAS leads to Na+ and water reabsorption and concomitantly urinary K+ secretion
  ➡ LFT
- Rule out other cause of abdominal pain
  ⇨ RFT
- Assess hydration and severity of hypovolemia
- Evaluate creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels
  ➡Serum amylase
- Pancreatitis as cause of paralytic ileus
  ➡Serum lactate
- Sensitive markers for bowel ischemia
  ➡Arterial blood gas (ABG)
- Metabolic acidosis
  - Lactic acidosis from bowel ischemia
  - Hypovolemia causing hypoperfusion of other organs
- Metabolic alkalosis
  - Vomiting of gastric acid leading to loss of H+ ions

2. Radiological tests
   ➡ AXR (erect and supine)

- May demonstrate non-specific signs of intestinal obstruction
  ➡ Meckel's scan
- Nuclear studies using 99m-Technetium pertechnetate which has an affinity for gastric mucosa to identify areas of ectopic gastric mucosa
  - Meckel's diverticulum lacking gastric mucosa will **NOT** be seen
- Evaluation of causes of GI bleeding
  - Performed early in the course of evaluation in children
  - Performed after other imaging has failed to define the source of bleeding in adults
    ➡ CT angiography (CTA)
- Indicated in patients with less severe bleeding in which CTA is able to detect bleeding of as little as 0.3 mL/min
- CTA is able detect active signs of bleeding such as that from a Meckel's diverticulum that may be undetectable with other technique such as tagged RBC scan, conventional arteriography or colonoscopy
  ➡ Mesenteric arteriography
- Reserved for patients with severe bleeding requiring transfusion given that for some lesions such as AV malformation, but not typically Meckel's diverticulum, therapeutic maneuvers may be possible
- Diagnosis is established by the finding of an anomalous SMA branch feeding the diverticulum and active contrast extravasation with ongoing hemorrhage
  ➡ Other imaging modalities
- Wireless capsule endoscopy
- Double-balloon enteroscopy

1041

VI. **Treatment**

1. General approach
   ➡Asymptomatic patients

- Detection on imaging
  - Do **NOT** perform elective resection
- Detection during abdominal exploration - Elective resection in children up to young adulthood - Elective resection in adult age < 50 if there is palpable abnormality, diverticulum longer than 2 cm or diverticulum has a broad base > 2 cm - Do **NOT** perform resection in adult age > 50
  ➡Symptomatic patients
- **ALL** patients should undergo supportive and surgical treatment as listed below

2. Supportive management
   ➡Nil per os (NPO)
   ➡IV fluid infusion (Drip and suck) - Correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance
   ➡Nasogastric (NG tube) decompression (Drip and suck)
   ➡Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) - Patients with GI bleeding should be initiated on PPI therapy

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡Simple diverticulectomy

- Refers to excision of diverticulum at its base
- Most easily performed with a linear gastrointestinal stapler applied to the base of diverticulum
- Indications - Diverticulum with a narrow base (≤ 2 cm)
  ➡Segmental small bowel resection with primary anastomosis
- Wedge ileal resection removes the gastric mucosa within the diverticulum as well as the mucosal ulceration located in the adjacent small bowel
- Indications - Diverticulum with a wide base (> 2 cm)
  ➡Complications
- Wound infection
- Postoperative paralytic ileus
- Anastomotic leak

VII. **Complication**

1. Complications of Meckel's diverticulum
   ➡ GI bleeding
   ➡Intestinal obstruction (IO)
   ➡Perforation
   ➡Meckel's diverticulitis
   ➡Herniation of diverticulum (Littre's hernia)

# Pediatric Diseases

## Intussusception

I. **Overview** 1. General features
➡ Intussusception refers to invagination (telescoping) of a part of intestine into itself
➡ Most common abdominal emergency in early childhood and is unusual in adults
➡ Location of intussusception - Occurs most often at ileocecal junction (Ileocolic intussusception) - Can also occurs as ileo-ileal intussusception (Small bowel intussusception) - Less likely to respond to non-operative reduction - More likely to respond spontaneously - Other locations include jejuno-jejunal, jejuno-ileal or colo-colic intussusception
II. **Epidemiology** 1. General epidemiology
➡ Male predominance (M:F = 3:2)
➡ Age distribution - **MOST** common cause of intestinal obstruction in infants between 6 – 36 months of age - Majority of patients are younger than 2 years of age - Uncommon before 3 months and after 6 years and when it does occur it is more likely to be associated with a lead point

III. **Etiology** 1. Causes of intussusception
➡ Idiopathic - 75% of intussusception are idiopathic since there is no clear disease trigger or pathological lead point - Influence of viral factors - Hypertrophy of Peyer's patches (common in children) in lymphoid-rich terminal ileum secondary to viral infection such as URTI or gastroenteritis - Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia act as a lead point for intussusception
➡ Pathological lead point (common in adults) - Lead point is a lesion or variation of intestine that is trapped by peristalsis and dragged into the distal segment of intestine - Examples of pathological lead point - Meckel diverticulum (common) - Polyps - Lymphoma - Duplication cysts - Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP)
➡ Post-operative - Caused by uncoordinated peristaltic activity or traction from suture or devices such as a gastrojejunal feeding tube

1043

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡ Rectal bleeding and vomiting

- Meckel diverticulum
- Malrotation with midgut volvulus
- Bacterial colitis
  ➡ Lethargy and coma
- Septic shock

IV. Pathogenesis

1. Pathogenesis of intussusception
   ➡ Intussusceptum which is a proximal segment of bowel telescopes into intussuscipiens which is a distal segment

- Telescoping drags the associated mesentery with it leading to development of venous and lymphatic congestion
- Result in intestinal edema and ultimately lead to ischemia, perforation and peritonitis

V. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Abdominal pain

- **Onset:** Sudden onset
- **Character:** Crampy
- **Associated symptoms:** Inconsolable crying and drawing up of legs towards abdomen
- **Time course:** Intermittent and progressive with each episode occurring at 15 – 20 mins intervals
  ➡ Vomiting
- Emesis is non-bilious initially but it becomes bilious as obstruction progresses
  ➡ Red-currant jelly stool (rectal bleeding)
- Stool contains gross or occult blood in 70% of cases
- Stool is a mixture of blood and mucous giving an appearance of currant jelly
  ➡ Lethargy
  ➡ Altered level of consciousness
- Coma

[Image Description: This is a page from a medical textbook or document, likely describing the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of intussusception. The text is structured with numbered sections and bullet points, highlighting key symptoms and characteristics.]

VI. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡Sausage-shaped abdominal mass

- Usually palpable in the right side of abdomen

2. Radiological tests
   ⇨ AXR

- Performed as part of the evaluation of patients with abdominal symptoms and to exclude perforation in patient with suspected intussusception
- Radiographic features - Signs of obstruction including distended loops of bowel with absence of colonic gas and presence of air-fluid levels - "Target sign" consisting of two concentric radiolucent circles superimposed on right kidney representing peritoneal fat surrounding and within intussusception - "Crescent sign" which is a soft-tissue density representing intussusceptum projecting into the gas the large bowel
  ⇨ USG
- Imaging modality of choice to identify intussusception
  - Sensitivity and specificity can approach 100% in experienced hand
- Able to detect pathological lead point and can monitor success of reduction procedure and does not expose patient to radiation
- Classical finding - "Target sign" ("Doughnut"/ "Bull-eyes") at RLQ representing layers of intestine within the intestine in transverse USG view - "Pseudokidney sign" in longitudinal USG view - Lack of perfusion in intussusceptum indicates development of ischemia
  ➡CT scan
- Reserved for patients in whom other imaging modalities are unrevealing or to characterize pathological lead points for intussusception detected by USG
- Intussusception can be recognized and pathological lead point can also be identified but expose patients to substantial radiation

1045

VII. Treatment

1. Non-operative reduction
   ➡ Background

- Preferred first treatment with high success rate in most cases
  - Treat with IV hydration and decompression
- Ultrasound (**better**) VS Fluoroscopic guidance
  - Ultrasound is now the intervention of choice
  - Fluoroscopic guidance using barium or water-soluble contrast (preferred)
- Hydrostatic VS Pneumatic technique (**better**) - Hydrostatic technique using normal saline (NS) - Pneumatic technique using air or CO2 reduces intussusception more easily and is more advantageous if perforation occurs
  ➡ Preparation
- Stabilization and resuscitation with IV fluid is required before non-operative reduction
- Prophylactic antibiotics may be given due to risk of perforation
  ➡ Outcomes
- Successful reduction is indicated by - Appearance of water and bubbles in terminal ileum - Free flow of contrast or air into terminal ileum - Relief of symptoms - Disappearance of abdominal mass
  ➡ Complications
- Perforation (< 1%) - Risk factors include age < 6 months, long duration of symptoms and higher pressure during reduction
  ➡ Post-reduction management
- Observation with hospitalization requires for 12 – 24 hours
  - Patient usually present with fever after successful reduction due to bacterial translocation or release of endotoxin or cytokines
  - Possibility to develop recurrent intussusception due to residual bowel inflammation which may itself act as pathological lead point
- Nasogastric suction is maintained until bowel function has returned and patient has passage of a bowel movement

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Manual reduction at operation is attempted in most cases but resection with primary anastomosis may be needed if manual reduction is not possible or a lead point is identified
   ➡ Indications

- Suspected intussusception who is critically ill
- Suspected bowel perforation
- Refractory to non-operative reduction

# Intestinal atresia

I. Overview

1. General features

➡Atresia is a congenital defect of a hollow viscus that results in complete obstruction of the lumen
➡One of the most frequent causes of bowel obstruction in newborn and can occur at any point along the gastrointestinal tract

- **MOST** commonly affected site is jejunum and ileum (jejunal-ileal atresia)
- Least commonly affected site is colon
  ➡Duodenal atresia causes complete obstruction whereas duodenal stenosis causes partial obstruction only

2. Classification
   ➡Classification based upon anatomical characteristics

- Type III is the **most** common
- Type I is the least common

[Image of five types of intestinal atresia. Type I (mucosal web): A diagram showing a single, thin membrane (web) obstructing the lumen of the intestine. Type II (fibrous cord): A diagram showing two segments of the intestine connected by a thin fibrous cord. Type IIIa (mesenteric gap defect): A diagram showing a gap in the mesentery with two intestinal segments separated. Type IIIb (apple-peel): A diagram showing the intestine coiled like an apple peel around a single blood vessel. Type IV (multiple atresia): A diagram showing multiple points of obstruction along the length of the intestine.]

Type I
(mucosal web)

Type II
(fibrous cord)

Type Illa
(mesenteric gap defect)

Type IIIb
(apple-peel)

Type IV
(multiple atresia)

3. Association with other conditions
   ➡Duodenal atresia

- Down syndrome
- Other malformations including
  - Cardiac/ Renal/ Vertebral/ GI (Biliary atresia/ Agenesis of gallbladder)
    ➡Jejunal and ileal atresia
- Cystic fibrosis leading to meconium ileus
  ➡Colonic atresia
- Hirschsprung's disease

1047

II. Etiology

1. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Signs and symptoms of IO in neonates

- Malrotation of gut
- Hirschsprung disease
- Meconium ileus

III. Pathogenesis

1. Pathogenesis of intestinal atresia
   ➡Gastrointestinal tract is derived from derivatives of embryonic foregut, midgut and hindgut and
   interruption of normal development result in intestinal atresia

- Foregut: Mouth/ Pharynx/ Esophagus/ Stomach/ Proximal 1/3 of duodenum
- Midgut: Distal 2/3 of duodenum/ Jejunum/ Ileum/ Cecum/ Ascending colon/ Proximal
  2/3 of the transverse colon
- Hindgut: Distal 1/3 of transverse colon/ Descending colon/ Rectum/ Anus
  ➡Duodenal atresia
- During week 6 – 7 portion of intestinal tract is occluded as the endodermal epithelium
  proliferates
- During week 8 – 10 the patency is restored as recanalization
- Failure of recanalization during this period leads to duodenal atresia
  ➡Jejunal and ileal atresia
- Typically an acquired lesion resulting from vascular disruption (mesenteric supply)
  leading to ischemic necrosis of the fetal intestine - Segmental or midgut volvulus/ Intussusception/ Internal hernia
- Necrotic tissue is resorbed leaving blind proximal and distal ends often with a gap in the
  mesentery
  ➡ Colonic atresia
- Mechanism is unknown

IV. Clinical manifestation

V. **Diagnosis**

1. History taking
   ➡History of presenting illness (HPI)

- Time of onset of abdominal distension and vomiting
- Bilious or non-bilious vomiting
- Failure to pass meconium
- Feeding difficulties
  ➡Maternal history

- Sunken fontanelle
  ➡Abdominal examination
- Abdominal distension
- Abdominal mass
  - Visible loops of bowel
- Abdominal tenderness
  - Indicates meconium peritonitis due to intestinal perforation

4. Radiological tests

[X-ray of an infant's abdomen. The infant is lying on their back and their abdomen is showing distention indicating a possible bowel obstruction.]

AXR

[Ultrasound of an infant's abdomen. The ultrasound shows two distinct fluid-filled structures, representing the dilated stomach and duodenum, characteristic of a double-bubble sign.]

[MRI scan of an infant's abdomen. The MRI image shows the dilated stomach and duodenum, confirming the presence of a double-bubble sign.]

Ultrasound
MRI
A
B
Double-bubble sign

➡️ Prenatal USG

- Proximal atresia are generally more likely than distal lesion to be detected prenatally whereas distal lesions are detected after birth
  - Proximal lesions result in more severe dilatation of bowel since continuing fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid outpaces intestinal absorption
- Polyhydramnios
  - ONLY in proximal intestinal atresia and occurs more than 50% in patients with duodenal atresia
- Double-bubble sign
  - Dilatation of stomach and proximal duodenum
  - Absence of distal gas
- Dilated loops of bowel
- Increased bowel echogenicity
  ➡️ AXR
- Supine AP, erect, lateral decubitus or cross table lateral films
- Double-bubble sign
  - Sign may be obscured by excessive fluid in the stomach and in this cause aspiration by NG tube with injection of air can confirm diagnosis
- Dilated loops or bowel and presence of air-fluid levels
  - The more distal the atresia the more obvious the distension
- Intraperitoneal calcification
  ➡️ Contrast enema
- Indicates meconium peritonitis due to intestinal perforation
- Barium is used in most cases but hypertonic agents such as Gastrografin can be used if obstruction is thought to due to meconium ileus which is both diagnostic and therapeutic
- Reveals the presence of a microcolon
  - Result from the lack of use of this portion of bowel

## Intestinal malrotation

I. **Overview** 1. General features
➡ Intestinal malrotation occur when normal rotation of embryonic gut is arrested or disturbed
during in utero development

    2. Associated condition
    ➡ Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (~100%)
    ➡ Congenital heart disease (40 – 90%)
        *   Heterotaxy syndrome
    ➡ Omphalocele (31 – 45%)
        *   Midline abdominal wall defect covered by a membrane of amnion and peritoneum with
        Wharton’s jelly between the two layers and contains abdominal contents
        *   Occurs at the base of umbilical cord with the umbilical vessels inserting at the apex of
        omphalocele sac
    ➡ Gastroschisis
        *   Full-thickness paraumbilical abdominal wall defect usually associated with evisceration
        of bowel
    ➡ Intestinal atresia
    ➡ Esophageal atresia
    ➡ Biliary atresia
    ➡ Meckel's diverticulum

II. **Epidemiology** 1. General epidemiology
➡ Majority of patients present during neonatal period or within first year of life
_ Traditionally considered primarily a disease of infancy with infrequent occurrence
beyond first year of life
_ Some present as older children or adults and is associated with increased morbidity since
the diagnosis is often delayed

III. **Etiology** 1. Differential diagnosis
➡ Acute appendicitis
➡ Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)
➡ Intussusception

1052

IV. **Pathogenesis**

1. Normal embryology
   ➡ Embryonic development of gut

- During 4 - 8 weeks the embryonic abdominal cavity cannot accommodate the rapidly
  expanding GIT and thus the intestinal loop protrudes out into the area of yolk stalk
- Midgut begins 90° _anticlockwise rotation_ with SMA being the axis of rotation
  - Proximal part of midgut is thus on the right
  - Distal part of midgut is thus on the left
- Primary loop continues to grow
  - Proximal part of the loop becomes convoluted
  - Distal part of the loop develops a bulge which becomes the cecum
- Primary loop returns to abdomen during 8 - 10 weeks when the embryonic abdominal
  cavity is large enough to make an additional 180° _anticlockwise rotation_ - Proximal part of the loop returns first and passes under the distal loop and ends up
  in the left - Distal part of the loop returns and ends up in the right with the caudal descent of
  the cecum - Distal duodenum should end up behind the transverse colon
  ➡ Fixation of gut
- Normal rotation and fixation result in a wide-based mesentery that extends from the
  ligament of Treitz in LUQ to ileocecal valve at RLQ

[Image Description: The page contains text about the pathogenesis of normal embryology, discussing the development of the gut, rotation of the midgut, growth of the primary loop, return of the primary loop to the abdomen, and fixation of the gut.]

1053

2. Pathogenesis of malrotation

[Diagram of a malrotated intestine, showing the duodenum, appendix, Ladd's bands, and how extrinsic compression can cause duodenal obstruction. A second diagram shows the same intestine with a volvulus around a narrow-based mesentery.]

➡ Non-rotation (common)

- Both proximal and distal limbs returns to abdomen with no further rotation
- Small bowel is located on right of abdomen and colon on the left
- NOT as dangerous as incomplete rotation - Base of mesentery is wider and hence lower risk of volvulus
  ➡ Incomplete rotation (malrotation) (common)
- Proximal (duodenojejunal) limb remains in a position of non-rotation
- Distal (cecocolic) limb has partial rotation (90° instead of 180°)
  - Cecum ends up in the mid-upper abdomen instead of RLQ
- Abnormally positioned cecum is fixated to the right lateral abdominal wall by bands of peritoneum known as Ladd bands
  - Leads to duodenum obstruction since the Ladd bands cross over the duodenum and cause extrinsic compression
- Anomalies of rotation result in an abnormally narrow mesenteric base
  - Narrow mesenteric base permits abnormal mobility of small bowel allowing the mesentery to twist
  - Leads to volvulus ± bowel ischemia and perforation since the midgut is suspended on narrow vascular pedicle rather than on wide base of mesentery

1054

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms of malrotation
   ➡ Vomiting
   - _TYPICALLY_ bilious which is green or fluorescent yellow
   - Can be non-bilious as well
     ➡ Abdominal pain
     ➡ Abdominal distension
     ➡ Failure to thrive
     ➡ Feeding intolerance
     ➡ Malabsorption
2. Signs and symptoms of complications
   ➡ Hematochezia
   - Bowel ischemia and necrosis due to volvulus
     ➡ Peritonitis
   - Intestinal perforation due to volvulus
     ➡ Shock (Hemodynamic instability)
   - Hypovolemia due to dehydration or third space loss
   - Septic shock due to bowel necrosis

[Image Description: The page is predominantly white with black text. The text is organized into a list-like format, with arrows indicating the start of each item. The title 'V. Clinical manifestation' is at the top, followed by a list of signs and symptoms of malrotation and its complications. The word 'TYPICALLY' is italicized and potentially highlighted in red. The page number '1055' is located at the bottom right.]

VI. **Diagnosis**

1. Radiological tests

[Image of a black and white x-ray image, labeled "Cockscrew apperance". In the x-ray, a red arrow points to a spiral shaped structure, likely the 'corkscrew' appearance of the intestine. Contrast material is visible within the intestines, highlighting its contours. There is a second black and white x-ray image. This second image labeled "Dilatation of stomach and proximal duodenum". The x-ray shows the dilated stomach and proximal duodenum filled with contrast material. The outlines of these organs are clearly visible against the darker background. A feeding tube is visible extending down through the esophagus.]

⇨ AXR

- Exclusion of intestinal perforation by looking for pneumoperitoneum which allows diagnostic upper GI contrast series
- Findings suggesting intestinal malrotation
  - "Double-bubble" sign signifying duodenal obstruction
  - Gasless abdomen
  - Bowel wall thickening
  - Pneumoperitoneum
    ➡Upper GI contrast series (barium meal/ small bowel follow-through/ small bowel enema)
- **GOLD STANDARD** and is best to visualize the duodenum
- Classical findings in intestinal malrotation
  - "Corkscrew" appearance in duodenum
  - "Beak" appearance in volvulus
  - Dilatation of stomach and proximal duodenum in duodenal obstruction
  - Clearly misplaced duodenum with ligament of Treitz on right side of abdomen
    ➡CT abdomen with contrast
- Used in evaluation of abdominal pain but is not the best test to evaluate for intestinal malrotation
- Findings suggesting intestinal malrotation
  - "Whirlpool" sign indicating twisting of blood vessels around mesenteric pedicle
  - Proximal small bowel is mostly located to the right of midline
  - 3rd part of duodenum does not pass between mesenteric artery and aorta
  - Abnormal position of SMA and SMV

1056

# VII. Treatment

1. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Surgical principles - Purpose of surgery is **NOT** to return the bowel to a normal configuration which is anatomically impossible - Surgery is used to minimize future risk of volvulus by widening the base of mesentery, placing the bowel in a position of non-rotation and create adhesions to hold the intestines in place making subsequent volvulus unlikely
   ➡ Ladd's procedures - Can be performed in open or laparoscopic procedures - Open procedures remain the standard of practice - Laparoscopic procedures may lead to more recurrent volvulus due to fewer adhesions and usually performed in the absence of volvulus or bowel ischemia - Preoperative preparation - IV fluid resuscitation - Nasogastric decompression tube - Prophylactic antibiotics to cover bowel flora - Surgical technique (5 Steps)

| Intermesenteric band division                    | ➡ Intermesenteric bands are fibrous bands between bowel loops other than duodenum and cecum                                     |
|                                                  | ➡ Should be completely divided since these bands will constrict the mesenteric base                                             |

# Pediatric Diseases

## Hirschsprung disease (Congenital aganglionic megacolon)

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Motor disorder of gut which is caused by failure of neural crest cells (precursors of enteric ganglion cells) to migrate completely during intestinal development during fetal life
   ➡Aganglionic segment of colon fails to relax causing a functional intestinal obstruction
2. Classification of disease
   ➡Ultra-short segment disease
   - Describes a very short segment of aganglionosis extending 2 – 4 cm proximal to the internal anal sphincter
   - Clinical picture is similar to short segment disease except constipation is less severe and complications such as growth retardation and enterocolitis is less likely to develop
   - Important to distinguish from classical HD since patients may not require a pull-through operation and may respond to bowel management with diet, stool softeners and laxatives
     ➡Short segment disease
   - Accounts for 80% of patients
   - Aganglionosis affecting rectosigmoid colon only
     ➡Long segment disease
   - Accounts for 15 – 20% of patients
   - Aganglionosis extending proximal to sigmoid colon
     ➡Total colonic aganglionosis (TCA)
   - Accounts for 5% of patients
   - Aganglionosis affects the entire colon
3. Associated conditions
   ➡Syndromes (Syndromic HD)
   - Down syndrome (Trisomy 21)
     ○ Strong association present in 2 – 16% of patients with HD but conversely HD occurs in less than 1% of individuals with Down syndrome
     ➡Congenital anomalies
   - Genitourinary anomalies (common)
     ○ Congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) including renal hypoplasia and hydronephrosis are particularly common
   - Anorectal malformation
     ○ Anorectal malformation such as anal stenosis can occur
   - Congenital heart disease
     ○ Occurs in 50% of patients with syndromic HD usually Down syndrome but is rare in patients without an associated syndrome
   - Visual and hearing impairment (common)
     ○ Ophthalmologic abnormalities such as refractive errors are found in 40% of patients with HD
     ○ Hearing impairment occurs in 5% of patients with HD

1058

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡Occurs in 1 in 5000 live births
   ➡ Male predominance (M:F = 3:1 to 4:1)

III. Etiology

1. Causes of Hirschsprung disease
   ➡ Genetics

- Predominant gene affected is RET proto-oncogene with mutation in this gene causing a loss-of-function
- RET protein is a receptor tyrosine kinase that appears to transduce growth and differentiation signal in developing tissues including those derived from neural crest

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Gastrointestinal malformation

- Intestinal atresia or stenosis
- Malrotation of the gut
- Anorectal malformation
- Internal anal sphincter achalasia
  ➡Meconium ileus
- Due to cystic fibrosis
  ➡Meconium plug syndrome
- Condition occurs up to 1:500 newborn
- Due to colonic dysmotility or abnormal meconium consistency leading to obstipation in the newborn
  ➡Small left colon syndrome
- Occurs in diabetic mothers and appears to be due to transient left colon dysmotility leading to delayed passage of stool
  ➡Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction
- Including intestinal neuronal dysplasia

IV. Pathogenesis

1. Pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease
   ➡Defect in craniocaudal migration of neuroblasts originating from neural crest

- Begins at 4 weeks of gestation and ends at 7 weeks with the arrival of neural crest-derived cells at the distal end of colon
- Failure of cells to reach distal colon leaves that segment aganglionic and therefore non-functional
  ➡Defect in differentiation of neuroblasts into ganglion cells and ganglion cells destruction within the intestine may also contribute to the disorder

1059

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Vomiting - Bilious or feculent emesis in distal intestinal obstruction
   ➡ Constipation - Refractory constipation especially at age 0-6 months
   ➡Abdominal distension
   ➡Failure to pass meconium - Delay in passage of first meconium within 48 hours of age is suggestive - 100% of normal full-term baby can pass meconium by 48 hours of life - 50-90% of HD patients will fail to pass meconium by 48 hours of life - Passage of stool within first one to two days thus does NOT exclude diagnosis
   ➡ Failure to thrive
2. Signs and symptoms of Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC)
   ➡ Fever - Septic shock can occur in severe cases
   ➡ Vomiting
   ➡ Diarrhea
   ➡Abdominal pain
   ➡Abdominal distension
   ➡ Anorexia
   ➡ Fatigue

VI. **Diagnosis**

1. Physical examination
   ➡PR examination - Tight anal sphincter - Squirt sign or blast sign - Explosive expulsion of gas and stool after digital rectal examination - DRE acts to relieve obstruction temporarily
2. Biochemical tests
   ➡ Full-thickness rectal suction biopsy - **GOLD** standard for diagnosis of HD and is more sensitive and specific than barium enema and anorectal manometry - Should be taken 2 cm above the level of dentate line to avoid the 1-2 cm zone of physiologic aganglionosis that is normally present - 3 rectal biopsy specimen which is 2-3-4 cm above dentate line is taken - Findings suggestive of HD - Lack of ganglion cells - Hypertrophic nerve fibers - Increased acetylcholinesterase activity or staining in muscularis mucosae - Decreased or absence of calretinin-immunoreactive fibers in lamina propria - Ultra-short segment HD - Biopsy taken just proximal to dentate line shows aganglionosis whereas biopsy taken 4 cm above internal sphincter shows normal ganglion cells

The page ends with the number "1060" in the lower right corner.]

3. Radiological tests
   ⇨ AXR

- Cone-shaped transition zone
  - **Diagnostic** of HD
  - Commonly located in the rectosigmoid area
  - Represents the change from the dilated colon proximal to aganglionic region to the normal calibre or narrowed aganglionic segment
  - Entire colon will appear normal but with dilated loos of distal small bowel in total colonic aganglionosis (TCA)
- Dilatation of segment of colon immediately proximal to aganglionic segment
- Absence of rectal gas
- Presence of air-fluid levels
  - Radiographic signs and obstruction
    ➡Barium or water-soluble contrast enema
- Performed without stool cleanout (unprepped)
- Look for transition zone which is pathognomonic and to determine the length of aganglionic segment
  - Follow-up post-evacuation film 24 hours should be obtained if a transition zone is not clearly detected in which it may reveal residual retained contrast
- Rectosigmoid index
  - Ratio between diameter of rectum to sigmoid colon is typically > 1 normally
  - Reversal of this ratio is suggestive of HD
- Limitations
  - Lower sensitivity than rectal biopsy and anorectal manometry due to FN results such as in ultra-short segment HD or after DRE which decompress bowel so effectively such that contrast enema appears normal
  - Diagnosis should always be confirmed with rectal biopsy even if barium enema shows typical features of HD
  - Absence of transition zone does **NOT** entirely exclude HD
    ➡Anorectal manometry
- Particularly useful in patients with ultra-short segment HD
- Helpful as a screening test since demonstration of relaxation of internal anal sphincter with distension of rectum excludes the diagnosis of HD
- Interpretation
  - Presence of anorectal inhibitory reflex excludes HD
  - Absence of anorectal inhibitory reflex is suggestive of HD as the lack of anorectal relaxation is the physiological basis for all the clinical features
    [Image of the number 1061 in the bottom right corner of the page.]

VII. Treatment

1. Surgical treatment
   ➡Abdominoperineal pull-through operation (2-stage/ 3-stage)

- Types of pull-through operation including Soave, Duhamel and Swenson
- Laparoscopic-assisted and transanal repair are gaining popularity and is now preferred over open procedures in most centres
- Procedures
  - Diverting colostomy is constructed to allow the dilated bowel to decompress
  - Resection of the aganglionic segment of colon and bring the normal ganglionic bowel down close to the anus with preservation of internal anal sphincter
  - Reversal of the colostomy to restore continuity of GIT
- Complications
  - Diarrhea and incontinence due to loss of water-absorptive surface area from colonic resection and anal sphincter dysfunction
  - Constipation due to obstruction by stricture, persistent or acquired aganglionosis, colonic motility disorder such as intestinal neuronal dysplasia or increased internal anal sphincter tone
  - Enterocolitis remains a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality with incidence as high as 45%

➡Myomectomy

- Indicated for patients with ultra-short segment HD who is refractory to conservative treatment with bowel management
- Removal of a 0.5 – 1.0 cm wide strip of inner circular muscle in posterior midline from level of internal anal sphincter to level of normal ganglionated bowel

VIII. Complication

1. Complications of HD
   ➡Acute intestinal obstruction

- Newborn seldom require emergency surgery and majority of patient can be resuscitated and stabilized by non-operative means
- Resuscitation includes IV fluids, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, nasogastric or orogastric suction, twice daily rectal irrigations and daily DRE
- Full diagnostic workup including contrast enema and rectal biopsy should be performed once patient is stabilized
- Surgical intervention is indicated in patients refractory to non-operative measures to relieve obstruction and prevent perforation which includes a diverting colostomy or ileostomy
  1062

➡Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC)

- General features
  - MOST severe and lethal complication which can progress into toxic megacolon
  - Occurs prior to surgery, immediate in post-operative period or years after definitive repair
- Risk factors
  - Delayed in diagnosis of HD > 1 week of age
  - Increased length of aganglionic segment
  - Presence of Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)
  - Presence of other associated anomalies
- Pathogenesis
  - Stasis and reduced production of protective mucin
  - Leads to bacterial overgrowth in the lumen of bowel proximal to involved segment and translocation of bacteria through mucosa
  - Bowel wall in affected area is subsequently invaded by colonic organism which can lead to perforation, peritonitis, septic shock and death
- Diagnosis
  - AXR shows presence of air-fluid levels and cut-off sign (dilated proximal colon and absence of air in distal rectosigmoid colon with an abrupt cut-off at level of pelvic brim)
  - CT shows thickening of wall of entire large bowel and terminal ileum with enhancement of the mucosa
  - Contrast enema should **NOT** be performed due to risk of intestinal perforation
- Management
  - IV fluid resuscitation
  - IV antibiotic therapy
  - Repeated rectal irrigations through rectal tube with saline (which decompress the colon and protect against development of HAEC)
  - Diverting ileostomy or colostomy (if refractory to non-operative measures)

➡ Volvulus

- Usually affect the sigmoid and less commonly the transverse colon and cecum
- Related to torsion of an enlarged colonic segment filled with meconium or feces
- Diagnosis
  - AXR which will reveal distended intestinal loops with presence of air-fluid levels
  - Confirmed with a contrast enema which may also de-torse the volvulus
- IV fluid and antibiotics should also be administered
- Surgical intervention is indicated for suspected bowel necrosis and perforation

## Abdominal wall defects (Gastroschisis/ Omphalocele)

I. Overview

1. General features

[Image of Gastroschisis: A newborn baby lying on a bed, with a visible abdominal wall defect on the right side of the umbilical cord. The intestines are protruding out of the abdomen and are not covered by a sac. The baby's skin appears reddish and irritated around the exposed organs.]

Gastroschisis

[Image of Omphalocele: A newborn baby lying on a bed. The baby has a large, sac-like protrusion from the abdomen at the location of the umbilicus. The sac appears smooth and translucent, revealing internal organs within. The baby's skin appears normal and intact around the sac.]

Omphalocele

➡ Gastroschisis is a full-thickness paraumbilical abdominal wall defect usually associated with evisceration of bowel and sometimes other abdominal organs and NOT covered by a sac

- Bowel herniation can lead to intestinal abnormalities because the mesenteric blood supply can become compromised and prolonged exposure of bowel to toxic environment of amniotic fluid may result in inflammatory changes in bowel wall
- Other potential sequelae include growth restriction, spontaneous preterm birth and fetal demise

➡ Omphalocele is a midline umbilical defect covered by amniotic and peritoneal membrane with Wharton's jelly between two layers and contains abdominal contents

- Defects occur at the base of umbilical cord with the cord or umbilical vessels inserting at the apex of omphalocele sac
- Varies from small defect with intestinal contents to giant omphalocele in which defect measures ≥ 4 cm and contains the liver

2. Comparison between gastroschisis and omphalocele

|                      | Gastroschisis            | Omphalocele                                      |
| :------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Location             | Lateral                  | Umbilicus                                        |
| Defects              | Smaller                  | Larger                                           |
| Sac                  | Absent                   | Present (Sac may occasionally rupture)           |
| Cord                 | Normal                   | Inserts in sac                                   |
| Bowel                | Matted                   | Normal                                           |
| Bowel function       | Ileus                    | Normal                                           |
| Liver                | Typically intracorporeal | Often associated with extracorporeal liver (80%) |
| Associated anomalies | Rare                     | Common                                           |

1064

3. Associated conditions
   ➡Gastroschisis

- Associated with GI anomalies including intestinal atresia, malrotation, stenosis, perforation, necrosis or volvulus in 25% of case
  ➡Omphaloceles
- Associated with prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
- Associated with chromosomal abnormalities (fetal aneuploidy) when it is non-liver-containing (60%) (contains only small bowel with the liver being intracorporeal)
  - Trisomy 13/ 18/ 21/ Turner syndrome
- Associated with structural anomalies
  - GI abnormalities
  - Cardiac defect (**50%**)
  - Genitourinary anomalies
  - Orofacial clefts
  - Neural tube defects
  - Defects of diaphragm
  - Growth restriction
- Associated syndromes
  - Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome\* (macroglossia, macrosomia, giantism, hypoglycemia, visceromegaly, omphalocele)
  - Pentalogy of Cantrell (lower thoracic wall malformation (cleft sternum), ectopia cordis, epigastric omphalocele, anterior midline diaphragmatic hernia, cardiac anomalies)
  - OEIS syndrome (omphalocele, exstrophy of the bladder, imperforated anus, spinal defects)

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ Gastroschisis and omphalocele are the most common fetal abdominal wall defects

III. Pathogenesis

1. Pathogenesis
   ➡ Normal embryology

- Midgut herniates outward through umbilical ring and continues to grow during normal development of human embryo
- Midgut returns back into abdominal cavity by 11th week of gestation and undergoes counterclockwise rotation and fixation along with closure of umbilical ring
  ➡ Gastroschisis
- Truly an abdominal wall defect
- Result of an isolated intrauterine vascular insult resulting in an abdominal wall defect to the right of umbilical cord
  ➡ Omphalocele
- Considered as a rotational anomaly
- Failure of extraembryonic gut to return back to the abdominal cavity and undergo the obligatory 270° counterclockwise rotation resulting in hernia covered by peritoneal sac

1065

# IV. Diagnosis

1. Prenatal diagnosis
   - Majority of cases can be detected by the end of 1st trimester (11 – 14 weeks)
   - ➡Gastroschisis
     - ↑ Maternal serum AFP level in almost all cases of gastroschisis
     - Prenatal USG examination
       - Appears a relatively small paraumbilical abdominal wall defect usually to the right of midline with visceral herniation
       - Umbilical cord insertion site is adjacent to and separate to the defect and should be normal
       - Intestines are usually the only herniated organ but the liver and stomach may also herniate
   - ➡ Omphalocele
     - ↑ Maternal serum AFP level in most cases
     - Prenatal USG examination
       - Appears as an upper, middle or lower midline abdominal wall defect covered by an outer membrane of amnion and inner membrane of peritoneum with Wharton's jelly between the two layers and containing abdominal contents
       - Defect is most commonly middle at the base of umbilical cord with the cord or umbilical vessels inserting at the apex of omphalocele sac
       - Sac typically contains bowel and may contain liver, stomach or bladder
         - Omphalocele can be categorized as either liver-containing (80%) or non-liver-containing
     - Additional investigations
       - Genetic studies
         - Should be offered due to high risk of aneuploidy
         - Testing for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome may be reasonable
       - Fetal echocardiogram
         - Should be offered due to increased incidence of cardiac anomalies

[Image: The image shows the number "1066" at the bottom right corner of the page]

V. Treatment

1. Delivery room care
   ➡Sterile wrapping of the bowel to preserve body heat and minimizes insensible fluid loss

- Wrapping the bowel with sterile saline dressings covered with plastic wrap
- Infant is immediately placed into a plastic bag covering its lower half to maximize temperature control and hydration while allowing access to initial visual examination
- **AVOID** circumferential abdominal wall wraps as they have the potential to compromised blood flow
- **AVOID** pouring warm saline or excessively wet dressings since the warm saline ultimately drops to room temperature thereby cooling the infant
  ➡Establishing peripheral intravenous access
- Provide fluids and the maintenance requirement is increased 2 - 3x because of losses from the exposed bowel
  - Correct heat and fluid loss from exposed viscera
- Provide broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover maternal vaginal flora (e.g. ampicillin/gentamicin)
  ➡Inserting an orogastric tube to decompress the stomach
- Orogastric tube since neonates are obligate nasal breathers
  ➡Stabilizing the airway to ensure adequate ventilation
- Ensure a patent airway

2. Surgical treatment
   Repairing gastroschisis

[Image Description: A series of four medical illustrations showing the treatment of gastroschisis in a baby. The first image shows the baby with a birth defect where the intestines protrude through a hole near the umbilical cord. The second image shows doctors putting the intestines in a silo, a clear sheath of silicone, hung above the body so that gravity eases the intestines into the abdomen. The third image shows the intestines inserted back into the body and the hole being closed. The fourth image shows the baby being fed through a tube until the intestines are healed enough to digest breast milk or formula.]

➡Reduction and primary closure

- Bowel is decompressed by aspirating stomach contents and evacuating the large bowel through the rectum
- Size of the defect is increased 1 to 2 cm to minimize trauma to the bowel during reduction
- The abdominal wall is manually stretched and the bowel is replaced, taking care to avoid creating intra-abdominal pressure that is too high
- Primary closure of both fascia and skin
  ➡Silastic silo + Gentle reduction/ traction + Delayed (secondary) closure
- Preformed silo with a spring-loaded ring can be placed at bedside to cover the herniated intestine
- Silo is then reduced gradually over days followed by delayed closure of abdominal wall

1067

VI. **Prognosis**

1. Prognosis of abdominal wall defects
   ➡ Gastroschisis generally has the most favourable prognosis of abdominal wall defects because most cases are **NOT** complicated by concomitant non-GI anomalies or aneuploidy
   ➡ Omphalocele's prognosis directly correlates with the presence or absence of associated anatomic and chromosomal anomalies as well as the size of defect

[Image Description: This is a blank white image.]

# GI Diseases

## Short gut syndrome (SBS)

I. **Overview**

1. General features
   - Short bowel syndrome (SBS) refers to a reduction of functional intestinal surface area leading to malabsorption of nutrients, fluids or electrolytes
     - Term that describes the state when an individual's GI function is inadequate to maintain his or her nutrient or hydration status without IV or enteral supplementation
     - Clinical diseases correlate weakly with amount of intestine resected because of highly variable length of the human small bowel and remarkable ability of bowel to compensate for bowel resection
     - Best definition of SBS is therefore based upon intestinal dysfunction (i.e. the presence of significant malabsorption of both macronutrients and micronutrients)

II. **Etiology**

1. Causes of SBS in **children**
   - Necrotizing enterocolitis
   - Intestinal atresia
   - Mid-gut volvulus
   - Gastroschisis

2. Causes of SBS in **adults**
   - Intestinal resection\*
     - Usually for Crohn's disease, malignancy, radiation or mesenteric ischemia but may also be due to tissue damage from an underlying condition

1069

III. Pathogenesis

1. Intestinal determinants of intestinal function
   ➡ Small intestine length

- Infants with < 75 cm residual small intestinal length is at risk of developing SBS
  - Normal length of small intestine is approximately 160 cm at term
- Adults with < 180 cm residual small intestinal length is at risk of developing SBS - Normal length of small intestine is approximately 480 cm but ranges widely from 300 – 800 cm
  ➡ Site of intestinal resection
- Presence of colon helps to mitigate functional impairment in SBS such as that presence of 1/2 of colon is approximately equivalent to having an additional 50 cm of small intestines
- Loss of ileum and IC valve cause more intestinal dysfunction than loss of a similar among of jejunum
  ➡ Consequences of ileal resection
- Vitamin B12 absorption
  - Distal ileum is the primary site for absorption of vitamin B12 bound to intrinsic factor
- Bile acid absorption - Distal ileum is the selective site for absorption of bile acids and resection of > 100 cm of terminal ileum leads to disruption of enterohepatic circulation - Eventually results in bile acid deficiency because bile acid losses exceed the compensatory increase in hepatic bile acid production - Leads to fat malabsorption and diarrhea
  ➡ Consequences of loss of IC valve
- Absence of IC valve is typically associated with a longer duration of parenteral nutrition
- Due to reduction in small intestinal transit time which impairs nutrient absorption and loss of IC valve promotes small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) which result in vitamin B12 and deconjugation of bile acids

1070

IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Complications of SBS
   ➡ Watery diarrhea

- Results from reduction of absorptive surface area, decrease in intestinal transit time, small
  intestinal bacterial overgrowth or malabsorbed bile salts in colon leading to bile acid
  diarrhea (a secretory diarrhea)
- Management in children
  - Fluid replacement
    - Oral rehydration therapy (ORT)
    - IV fluid replacement (IVF)
  - Dietary modification - ↓ Osmotic load in intestinal lumen: Slowing enteral infusion rate/ Change
    to low-carbohydrate-high-fat enteral formula (fat has a lower osmotic load
    than carbohydrates and is thus better tolerated) - Change to diet with low fat content or with higher medium-chain
    triglycerides (MCT) oil content if diarrhea is due to fat malabsorption
    ➡ D-lactic acidosis
- Metabolic complication also known as D-lactate encephalopathy
- Neurological syndrome characterized by altered mental status ranging from confusion to
  coma, slurred speech, seizures and ataxia
- Results from bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates
- Occurs in patients with an intact colon and with underlying bacterial overgrowth
- Delivery of unabsorbed carbohydrate to colon causes gram-positive anaerobic bacteria to
  produce D-lactate (rather than L-lactate that is produced by normal metabolic process)
  ➡Electrolyte and nutrient deficiency
- Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)
  - Deficiency occurs due to fat malabsorption
  - Vitamin A deficiency = Night blindness and visual loss
  - Vitamin D deficiency = Metabolic bone disease/ Rickets
  - Vitamin E deficiency = Neuromuscular disorders and hemolysis
  - Vitamin K deficiency = Bleeding tendency
- Vitamin B12 deficiency
  - Can be accompanied by macrocytic anemia and neuropsychiatric dysfunction
- Electrolyte deficiency (Ca/ Mg)
  - Hypomagnesemia: Fatigue/ Depression/ Muscle weakness/ Neuromuscular
    excitability
    - Magnesium binds to unabsorbed fatty acids
  - Hypocalcemia: Metabolic bone disease/ Perioral and acral paraesthesia/
    Carpopedal spasm/Trousseau's sign/ Chvostek's sign
    - Hypomagnesemia leads to hypocalcemia
- Trace element deficiency (Zinc/ Copper/ Selenium)
  - Zinc deficiency = Impaired intestinal absorption and growth
  - Copper deficiency = Metabolic bone disease (Osteoporosis/ Metaphyseal
    changes/Physeal disruption)
  - Selenium deficiency = Cardiomyopathy
- Iron deficiency
  - Caused by inadequate absorption of iron or GI bleeding from anastomotic ulcers
- Essential fatty acids deficiency (EFAD)
  - Characterized by hair loss, fatty infiltration of liver, poor growth, developmental
    delay, poor wound

1071

➡Metabolic bone diseases

- Primary due to malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D both of which are consequences of fat malabsorption
- Increased risk for osteomalacia, osteopenia, osteoporosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism
- Managed with magnesium, calcium and vitamin D supplements
  ➡ Esophagitis/ Peptic ulcer disease (PUD)
- Gastrin hypersecretion due to loss of inhibitory hormones produced in the proximal gut including gastrin inhibitory peptide and vasoactive intestinal peptide
- Managed with PPIs to reduce gastric secretions and peptic complications
  ➡Gallstones (Cholelithiasis)
- Altered bile composition since resection of the ileum interrupts the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and causes bile to be supersaturated with cholesterol
- Bile stasis since the absence of meals or bolus feeds decrease meal-induced gallbladder contraction which is mediated by cholecystokinin (CCK) - Bile stasis promotes formation of biliary sludge and pigmented gallstones
  ➡Kidney stones (Nephrolithiasis)
- Increased risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis
- Calcium binds to unabsorbed fatty acids leaving oxalate free to pass into the colon to be absorbed and then filtered by the kidneys
- Management and prevention - Increased fluid intake - Low oxalate diet - Correction of metabolic acidosis with potassium citrate
  ➡TPN-associated conditions
- Catheter-associated infection
- Mechanical failure due to thrombosis or occlusion
- TPN-associated hepatic steatosis and cholestasis

1072

V. **Treatment**

1. General principles
   ➡Major portion of energy is delivered through parenteral nutrition in the early phase after intestinal
   resection for nutritional support
   ➡ Enteral nutrition should be initiated promptly to support intestinal adaptation

- Should be introduced early and advanced carefully but persistently as rapidly as tolerated
  by the patient
  ➡Dietary modification
- Fluid and electrolyte replacement
- **High** fat + **Low** carbohydrate + **Low**-oxalate
  ➡Patients are at risk of nutritional deficiency particularly when parenteral nutrition (PN) is tapered
  and after it is discontinued
- Most common deficiency include fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), vitamin B12, calcium
  and iron
- Additional supplements should be provided as needed

2. Medical treatment
   ➡Antisecretory agents

- Acid suppression = PPIs/ H2-antagonists
  - Inhibits excessive gastric secretion
- Bile acid sequestrants = Cholestyramine - Binds organic bile acids and improves bile acid diarrhea - Used with caution since it will impair fat-soluble vitamin absorption and cause GI
  irritation and have **NO** effects on diarrhea caused by carbohydrate malabsorption
  ➡Antimotility agents
- Loperamide - Useful in managing chronic diarrhea in patients with high stool output
  ➡Adaptive agents
- Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) = Teduglutide - Promote and maintain intestinal adaptation as part of an intestinal rehabilitation
  program in PN-dependent adults

1073

3. Surgical treatment

[Drawing of a surgical procedure called STEP procedure. The drawing shows an intestine with several small incisions marked with arrows along its length. Next to it, another drawing shows an instrument pinching the intestine where the incisions have been made. The final drawing in the sequence shows the intestine after the procedure, where the incisions have been closed, creating a zigzag pattern of overlapping tissue.]

**STEP procedure**

[Drawing of a surgical procedure called Bianchi procedure. The drawing shows a schematic representation of the intestines, where a portion is folded and sutured together.]

**Bianchi procedure**

➡ STEP procedure (Serial transverse enteroplasty procedure)\*

- Increases intestinal length, improves intestinal absorptive and decrease the risk of D-lactic
  acidosis due to bacterial overgrowth
- Technique is simpler and more flexible than Bianchi procedure
- No anastomosis required and the tapering can be performed on variably dilated bowel
- Can be performed alone or after a prior Bianchi procedure and can be repeated to further
  increase the intestinal length
- Complications include GI bleeding (most common), stricture and obstruction
  ➡ Bianchi procedure
- Also known as longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring (LILT)
- 1st surgical approach developed to lengthen the intestine
- Generally successful in improving absorption and nutritional status but requires multiple
  anastomosis and has the potential to compromise intestinal blood flow and unable to
  perform on segments of intestine with variable dilatation
- Patient can undergo only one Bianchi procedure

Pediatrics Diseases
Hepatoblastoma

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Arises from primitive cells that have the potential to differentiate along several lines
   • Embryonal tumor of liver
   ➡ **MOST** common primary liver malignancy in early childhood
   • Majority (> 2/3) of liver tumours in children are malignant
   • Two major histologic subgroups of malignancy = Hepatoblastoma/ HCC
   • Malignant mesenchymomas and sarcomas are much less common but constitute the remaining liver malignancy
   ➡ Majority of hepatoblastoma occurs in first 2 years of life and rarely and rarely over 5 years old
   • In contrast to HCC with a peak incidence between 10 – 15 years old and rarely occurs in children young than 5 years old
   ➡ Features of hepatoblastoma
   • Highly aggressive tumor
   • Usually in the right lobe of liver
   • Usually unifocal (in contrast to HCC which is often multicentric or extensively invasive)

2. Associated syndrome
   ➡ Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)_
   ➡ Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome_
   • Overgrowth syndrome characterized by visceromegaly, macroglossia and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia
   ➡ Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18)
   ➡ Downs syndrome (Trisomy 21)
   ➡ Li-Fraumeni syndrome
   ➡ Glycogen storage disease Type 1a
   ➡ Acardia syndrome
   ➡ Goldenhar syndrome

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ Male predominance (M:F = 2:1)

III. Etiology

1. Differential diagnosis of pediatric liver tumour
   ➡ Benign tumours
   • Hemangioma
   • Haemangioendothelioma
   • Mesenchymal harmatoma
   ➡ Malignant tumours
   • Hepatoblastoma
   • Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
   • Sarcoma (Angiosarcoma/ Rhabdomyosarcoma)

1075

IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Abdominal mass
   _ Occurs as a single mass in 85% and more often in the right lobe of liver
   _ Because of its rapid growth, death can occur from rupture and hemorrhage
   ➡Abdominal pain
   ➡Abdominal distension
   ➡Paraneoplastic syndromes\*
   _ Precocious puberty
   _ hCG is molecularly similar to LH
   _ Germ cell tumours or hepatoblastoma produce hCG which activates LH receptors on Leydig cells resulting to increased testosterone production
   _ Increase in testicular size is less than expected or no testicular enlargement since most of the testes is made up of tubular elements (Sertoli cells) whose maturation depends upon FSH
   _ Does NOT lead to precocious puberty in females since estrogen biosynthesis requires both activation of LH and FSH receptors
   ➡Constitutional symptoms
   _ Anorexia \* Weight loss

V. Diagnosis

1. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials
   _ Anemia
   _ Thrombocytosis
   ➡ LFT
   _ Liver enzymes and bilirubin are usually normal
   ➡Serum AFP level
   _ AFP is increased in 90% of patients with hepatoblastoma
   ➡ HBV and HCV serology
   ➡ Liver biopsy \* Biopsy should be performed unless lesion can be completely resected easily
2. Radiological tests
   ➡USG liver
   ➡CT abdomen
   _ Identify the lesions and to determine the degree of local invasiveness
   _ Determine the resectability of lesion
   ➡PET scan
   _ Confirm malignant nature of tumor
   _ Detects extra-hepatic metastasis

1076

VI. Treatment

1. General principles
   Complete surgical resection of tumor is the primary goal and is essential for cure
   Areas of locally invasive disease such as diaphragm should be resected at time of surgery
   ➡Preoperative chemotherapy should be administered to reduce the size of tumor and improve the
   possibility of complete removal for tumours that are unresectable
   Chemotherapy is more successful for hepatoblastoma than HCC
   ➡Liver transplantation
   Offered in selected patients for unresectable tumours
2. Staging of pediatrics liver tumor
   ➡European staging: Presurgical staging
   Stage I = Tumor involves only 1 quadrant + 3 Adjoining liver quadrants are free of tumor
   Stage II = Tumor involves 2 adjoining quadrants + 2 Adjoining liver quadrants are free of
   tumor
   Stage III = Tumor involves 3 adjoining quadrants or 2 non-adjoining quadrants + 1
   Adjoining quadrants or 2 non-adjoining quadrants are free of tumor
   Stage IV = Tumor involves all 4 quadrants + NO quadrants are free of tumor
   ➡ North American staging: Post-surgical staging
   Stage I No metastasis + Tumor completely resected
   Stage II = No metastasis + Tumor grossly resected with microscopic residual disease (i.e.
   positive margin)/ Tumor rupture/ Tumor spill at the time of surgery
   Stage III = No distant metastasis + Tumor unresectable or resected with gross residual
   tumor/ Positive lymph node
   Stage IV = Distant metastasis regardless of the extent of liver involvement
   VII. Prognosis
3. Prognosis of hepatoblastoma
   ➡ Overall survival is dictated primarily as to whether the tumor is resectable or not
   ➡ Overall survival rate for children with hepatoblastoma = 70%
   Compared with 25% in HCC
   ➡Cure rate according to stages
   Stage I and II = > 90%
   Stage III = 60%
   Stage IV = 20%

# Paediatric Diseases

## Wilm's tumor

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ **MOST** common primary renal malignancy in children < 15 years old accounting for 95% of all renal cases and 6% of all malignancy in children
   - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in contrast is more common in 15 - 19 years old
     ➡ Features of Wilm's tumor
   - 5% patients have bilateral involvement
   - 10% patients have multifocal loci within a single kidney
     ➡ Site of metastasis
   - Hematogenous metastasis to liver, lung, bone and brain
   - Lung is the most common metastatic site but children rarely presents with respiratory symptoms

2. Associated congenital syndrome
   ➡ WAGR syndrome
   - Chromosomal deletion of WT1 gene located at 11p13 in which WT1 gene product is a transcription factor involved in both gonadal and renal development
   - Syndrome of Wilm's tumour + Aniridia + Genitourinary anomalies + Retardation
   - Risk of developing Wilm's tumour is 50%
     ➡ Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
   - Overgrowth syndrome characterized by visceromegaly, macroglossia and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia
     ➡ Denys-Drash syndrome

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ No gender predominance
   ➡ Majority are diagnosed between 1-5 years old with peak incidence at age 3

1078

III. Etiology

1. Causes of Wilm's tumor
   ➡Majority (97%) of Wilm's tumor are sporadic - Occurs in the absence of a heritable or congenital cause or risk factor - Appeared to be caused by abnormal renal development resulting in proliferation of metanephric blastema without normal tubular and glomerular differentiation
   ➡Genetics - Wilms tumor can arise from both germline and somatic mutations and can occur in the presence or absence of family history - When a heritable risk factor is identified the affected children often present at an earlier age and are frequently bilateral

2. Differential diagnosis
   ➡Neuroblastoma
   ➡Mesoblastic nephroma
   ➡Rhabdoid tumour of kidneys
   ➡Clear cell sarcoma of kidneys
   ➡Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)

IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡Asymptomatic abdominal or flank mass or swelling - **MOST** common presentation without other signs or symptoms
   ➡Abdominal pain (30-40%)
   ➡Hypertension (25%) - Patients with subcapsular hemorrhage can present with fever, anemia, rapid abdominal enlargement and hypertension
   ➡Hematuria (12-25%)
   ➡Constitutional symptoms - Fever (25%) - Weight loss
   1079

V. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡Abdominal examination

- Firm non-tender smooth mass that is eccentrically located and rarely crosses the midline
- Should be performed carefully since vigorous palpation may rupture the renal capsule resulting in tumour spillage which increase tumor stage and need for more intensive therapy

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡CBC with differentials
   ➡Clotting profile and von Willebrand assay

- Detects acquired von Willebrand disease (VWD) which can occur in 4 – 8% of patients
- Should be obtained in patients with a history of bleeding or hypervascular tumours
- Usually has minimal clinical significance but there are case reports of severe bleeding requiring intensive intervention
  ➡ LFT
- Evaluate for the presence of liver metastasis
  ➡ RFT
- Serum creatinine and eGFR prior to surgical intervention
  ➡Serum Ca2+ level
- Elevated serum Ca2+ can be seen in children with rhabdoid tumor of kidney or congenital mesoblastic nephroma
  ➡Urine catecholamines
- Differentiate between Wilm's tumour and neuroblastoma
- Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA)
  Ο Neuroblastoma is derived from neural crest cells that are destined to form components of peripheral sympathetic nervous system

3. Radiological tests
   ⇨CXR

- Indicated to determine whether there is lung metastasis
- Patients with positive or suspicious CXR should be followed with CT thorax
  ⇨ AXR
- Eggshell appearance
- Presence of calcification in 10%
  ➡USG abdomen
- Typically the initial study to evaluate for abdominal mass
- Confirm renal origin of the mass
- Detects hydronephrosis or polycystic kidneys disease which also presents as abdominal mass or swelling
- Doppler technique can be used to detect tumor infiltration into renal vein and IVC and assess patency of blood flow
  ➡CT with contrast thorax + abdomen
- Further evaluate the nature and extent of the mass
- Detects nephrogenic rests which are precursor lesions with Wilm's tumor
- Detects lymph node metastasis and capsular penetration
- Confirm presence of contralateral kidneys and detects contralateral lesion

1080

VI. Treatment

1. Staging of Wilm's tumor
   ➡ National Wilms Tumor Study (NTWS) system classification

- Based upon surgical evaluation prior to administration of chemotherapy
- First 4 stages are confined to unilateral involvement

| Staging   | Description                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Stage I   | ➡Tumour is limited to kidney and completely excised                            |
| Stage II  | ➡ Tumour extends beyond the kidney but is completely excised                   |
| Stage III | ➡ No residual tumour is apparent at or beyond the margins of excision          |
|           | ➡Residual tumour remains after resection but is confined to abdomen            |
|           | ➡Includes regional LN involvement, peritoneal surface involvement, incomplete  |
|           | resection of tumour, tumour at or beyond the margin of resection, tumour       |
|           | spillage, previous biopsy or preoperative chemotherapy before removal of tumor |
| Stage IV  | ➡Hematogenous metastasis or LN involvement beyond the abdominopelvic region    |
| Stage V   | ➡Bilateral renal involvement                                                   |

➡Treatment according to staging

- Stage I and II = Primary surgical resection followed by vincristine + dactinomycin
  Ο NO radiation therapy is required
- Stage III = Primary surgical resection followed by triple therapy with vincristine + dactinomycin + doxorubicin
  - Radiotherapy based on LN involvement or extent of peritoneal contamination is administered to affected flank, hemiabdomen or complete abdomen
- Stage IV = Primary surgical resection followed by triple therapy with vincristine + dactinomycin + doxorubicin
  - Radiotherapy is administered to whole lung field only if lung metastasis do not completely resolve after chemotherapy
  - Radiotherapy to other metastatic sites other than lungs
- Stage V = Upfront chemotherapy + Nephron-sparing surgery
  Ο Intensive combination chemotherapy is given at time of diagnosis in attempt to reduce tumour size and facilitate early nephron-sparing surgery and better preservation of renal parenchyma

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡Radical nephroureterectomy + LN sampling

- A sample of regional LN should be included and all suspicious LN should be sampled
- Typically a transverse abdominal incision is made and a transperitoneal approach is used

VII. Prognosis

1. Prognosis of Wilm's tumor
   ➡Good prognosis

- For resectable disease, surgery and chemotherapy together results in > 90% cure rate
- Overall cure rate ~90% even in the presence of metastatic spread

# Urological Diseases

## Phimosis and paraphimosis

I. **Overview**

1. General features
   ➡**Phimosis** = Inability to retract the foreskin (prepuce)

- Divided into physiologic and pathologic phimosis
- Physiologic phimosis
- Seen in almost all newborn males
- Due to normal development of congenital adhesions between foreskin and glans
- Pathologic phimosis
- Foreskin that is truly non-retractable secondary to distal scarring of prepuce such as occurs with preputial fibrosis due to trauma, infection and inflammation
- Symptoms of pathologic phimosis
- Dysuria
- Painful erection
- Secondary non-retractability (previously retractable)
- Irritation or bleeding from preputial orifice
- Chronic urinary retention with ballooning that can only be resolved with manual compression
- Recurrent balanoposthitis
  ➡**Paraphimosis** = Retracted foreskin in an uncircumcised or partially circumcised males behind the coronal sulcus (rim of the glans) leading to painful constriction of glans penis
- Results in venous and lymphatic congestion of glans and ultimately arterial compromise
- Medical emergency that can lead to local skin necrosis, penile necrosis, infarction of the glans or gangrene (followed by autoamputation)
- Symptoms include swelling of penis and penile pain, dysuria, decreased urinary stream and urinary retention
- Marked penile pain with swelling of glans penis and distal foreskin due to a constricting band of tissue present at the coronal sulcus establishes the diagnosis of paraphimosis

II. **Pathophysiology**

1. Foreskin retraction
   ➡ Foreskin is the redundant skin that typically extends 1 cm beyond the glans

- Normally provides protection to the urethral meatus and glans penis
  ➡ Separation of foreskin from glans penis occurs by desquamation
- Begins late in gestation but remains incomplete in majority of infants at birth
- Only 4% of newborn males have a completely retractable foreskin
- More than 50% of newborn males have foreskin that cannot be retracted far enough to visualize the urethral meatus
- By 3 years old 90% of boys have a retractable foreskin
- Epithelial cells of the inner surface of the foreskin desquamate forming white pearly masses known as smegma
- Foreskin becomes more retractable with time as the creation of space between the glans penis and inner foreskin develops

[Image of a page break]

III. Etiology

1. Associated benign conditions
   ➡Smegma and preputial cysts

- Smegma are desquamated epithelial cells that are trapped under the foreskin
- In boys without a fully retractable foreskin, smegma may form white lumps under the
  foreskin often referred to as preputial cysts - Benign and located around the corona - Aids in process of separation between foreskin and glans penis and are extruded
  once the foreskin becomes more retractable
  ➡Foreskin ballooning
- Transient foreskin ballooning during voiding is usually benign and will resolve over time
  as there is increasing retractability of foreskin
- Only seek medical attention when urinary retention can only be resolved after applying
  manual pressure

2. Associated pathologic conditions
   ➡Recurrent UTI

- 4 – 10x increased risk of UTI in uncircumcised male infants
- In patients with recurrent UTI or who have genitourinary abnormalities, circumcision can
  be considered as a potential intervention to decrease risk of future UTI
  ➡Balanoposthitis
- Inflammatory condition of glans penis and foreskin
- Results from poor hygiene that is sometimes complicated by secondary infection
  ➡Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO)
- Chronic atrophic dermatitis of unknown etiology
- Characterized by white atrophic plaques on glans penis and foreskin which eventually
  enlarge and coalesce into sclerotic mass with resultant adhesions, phimosis and meatal
  stenosis
- Circumcision is the preferred intervention and is curative in most cases whereas topical
  corticosteroids is less effective except in mild cases

3. Causes of paraphimosis
   ➡ Phimosis

- Patients at greatest risk for developing paraphimosis typically have a partial phimosis
- Subsequent retraction of foreskin leads to entrapment and paraphimosis
- Failure or inability to reduce retracted foreskin after cleaning by caregiver or after
  urination typically due to physiologic phimosis
  ➡Genitourinary procedures
- Failure of a medical personnel to return a fully retractable foreskin to normal position
  after cystoscopy or bladder catheterization
  ➡Sexual activity
  ➡Penile trauma
  1083

IV. Treatment of phimosis

1. Non-pharmacological treatment
   ➡Routine care and hygiene

- Foreskin requires no special care other than what is provided to rest of the body
- Gentle retraction of foreskin with diaper changes and bathing will allow gradual and progressive retraction of foreskin over the glans
  - **AVOID** forceful retraction because tearing may cause bleeding and can result in fibrosis and development of pathologic phimosis
- As the foreskin naturally begins to retract, cleaning and drying underneath the foreskin can be performed
- Retracted foreskin should always be pulled down to its normal position covering the glans penis after bathing since failure to do so may result in paraphimosis
- Teach boys to pull back foreskin to void

2. Circumcision
   ➡ Indications

- Recurrent febrile UTIs
- Underlying urological anomalies
- Recurrent attacks of balanoposthitis
- Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO)
- Potential benefits of circumcision
  - Risk of UTIs
  - ↓ Risk of sexually transmitted disease (HIV/ HSV/ Gonorrhoea)
  - ↓ Risk of penile inflammation and retractile disorders
  - ↓ Risk of penile malignancy
    ➡ Contraindications
- Unstable or premature infants with medical conditions
- Bleeding diathesis
- Congenital penile anomalies
  - Micropenis
  - Hypospadias with foreskin abnormalities
  - Chordee or ventral curvature of penis
  - Webbed penis (Penoscrotal webbing)
  - Buried/ Hidden/ Concealed penis (prepuce needed for reconstruction)
  - Penile torsion
    ➡ Techniques
- Pain control with dorsal penile block (DPNB) using lidocaine **WITHOUT** adrenaline or local topical anesthetic such as lidocaine cream
  - A pair of dorsal penile nerves provides sensation to the glans and shaft of penis as well as to the foreskin
  - DPNB is preferred over ring block since a single injection reduces the risk of penile edema in comparison with ring block
- Choices of technique
  - Gomco clamp
  - Mogen clamp
  - Plastibell

[Image of a page with information on treatment of phimosis and circumcision, including non-pharmacological treatment, indications, contraindications, and techniques. The text is structured with headings, bullet points, and sub-bullets, providing detailed instructions and information about the medical procedures.]

➡ Complications of circumcision

- General complications = Bleeding/ Infection/ Anesthetic complications
- Specific complications
  - Glans injury (Penile amputation)
  - Urethral complications
    - Meatal stenosis
    - Urethrocutaneous fistula
  - Skin complications
    - Excessive skin removal
    - Too little skin removed
    - Epidermal inclusion cysts
    - Skin bridges

V. **Treatment of paraphimosis**

1. Surgical treatment
   ➡Manual reduction
   - Provide adequate analgesia before attempting reduction
     ➡Dorsal slit reduction
   - Incision of the constricting band of foreskin is necessary if manual reduction fails
   - Patient should undergo delayed circumcision after full resolution of foreskin edema

# Pediatric Diseases

# Hypospadias

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Hypospadias is a congenital anomaly of male urethra that results in abnormal ventral placement
   of urethral opening

- Location of urethral meatus can range anywhere within the glans, the shaft of penis, the
  scrotum or perineum
  ➡Defined as a combination of any or all of the following associated penile anomalies
- Ectopic urethral meatus
  - Appearance of two urethral openings
  - One opening is in the normal position at the end of glans which is usually a blind
    ending urethral pit
  - Another opening is abnormally located true urethral meatus
    - Anterior/ Distal (glans or corona) = 40–50%
    - Middle (penile shaft) = 25–30%
    - Posterior/ Proximal (scrotum or perineum) = 20%
- Penile curvature (chordee)
- Ventral foreskin deficiency with incomplete foreskin closure around the glans leading to
  the appearance of a dorsal hooded appearance

2. Associated conditions\* (always look for associated features in PE)
   ➡ Cryptorchidism (undescended testes) = 10%
   ➡Inguinal hernia = 9%

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ Incidence = 1 in 300 male births (0.3–0.7%)

1086

### III. Pathogenesis

1. Anatomy

[Cross-sectional diagram of a penis, showing the anatomical structure with labels. At the top of the diagram, are the superficial dorsal vein (blue), the deep dorsal vein (blue), and the skin. Further down is the deep (Buck's) fascia which surrounds the corpus cavernosum. Inside the corpus cavernosum is a red and white sponge-like tissue. Ventrally, below the corpus cavernosum, is the urethra surrounded by the corpus spongiosum, which also contains a red and white sponge-like tissue. Dorsally, are the dorsal artery (red), and the dorsal nerve (yellow). The corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum are encased in the tunica albuginea. The diagram is labeled as "Ventral Cross-section".]

➡Dorsal penile nerves lie on top of Buck's fascia which circumferentially envelops the corpus
cavernosum and spongiosum

- Innervates the sensation of glans, penile shaft and anterior urethra
- Neurovascular bundles lie in the 11 and 1 o'clock position with branches extending
  longitudinally from 11-7 o'clock and 1 - 5 o'clock along the surface of tunica albuginea
- NO nerve fibers are founded at 12 o'clock position

2. Embryology
   ➡External genitalia in both sexes develop from common anlagen (genital tubercle, swelling and
   fold) and remains indistinguishable until 7 - 8 weeks of gestation
   ➡External genitalia begin to differentiate due to androgenic stimulation in male fetus

- Androgenic stimulation induces the urethral groove to fuse in a proximal to distal fashion
  forming the tubular urethra
- Penile urethra forms as a result of remoulding and fusion of the medial edges of the
  endodermal urethral folds
- Involves a distal canalization of urethral plate (opening zipper) and simultaneous fusion
  of proximal urethral folds (closing zipper)
- Coronal sulcus separates the glans from the shaft of penis by 12 weeks of gestation
- Urethral formation is complete with foreskin completely covers the glans by 16-18
  weeks of gestation
  ➡Pathology in hypospadias
- Urethral folds fail to completely or partially close and the foreskin does not fuse onto the
  ventral aspect of the penis
- The extent of fusion failure determines the position of urethral opening

1087

IV. Etiology

1. Factors contributing to hypospadias
   ➡Proposed mechanism of hypospadias is disruption of androgenic stimulation required for the
   normal development of male external genitalia
   ➡Endocrine disturbances

- Disruption in synthetic pathway of androgens
- May be a delay in maturation of hypothalamic-pituitary axis
  ➡ Genetics
- Familial rate = 7%
- Mutations in genes that affect androgen metabolism and estrogen and androgen response
  have been associate with hypospadias
  ➡Environmental exposures
- Maternal exposure to estrogenic compounds including progestins
- Paints/ Solvents/ Adhesives/ Detergents/ Pesticides/ Cosmetics/ Industrial chemicals

1088

V. Diagnosis

1. Physical examination
   ➡Assessment of stretched penile length

- Glans penis held with thumb and forefinger
- Penis is fully stretched until the point of increased resistance is reached
- Measurement is made with a ruler from pubic ramus to the distal tip of glans penis over the dorsal side
  ➡Assessment of penile curvature (chordee) and the degree of curvature
- Classified by the curvature when penis is fully erected
  Ο Normal = No curvature - 15 degrees
  Ο Mild = 15-40 degrees
  Ο Moderate = 40 - 80 degrees
  Ο Severe => 80 degrees
  ➡Assessment of foreskin to ensure complete and circumferential development of foreskin without any ventral asymmetry or deficiency
- If foreskin is normally circumferential it is unlikely that a significant hypospadias requiring surgery is present
- If foreskin is not properly formed, then the presence of an ectopic urethral meatus along ventral shaft of penis should be sought after and identified
  ➡Assessment of associated conditions
- Cryptorchidism
- Inguinal hernia
  ➡Classification of hypospadias based on PE findings

Remarks: No surgical correction required for forme fruste of hypospadias; Endocrine evaluation to detect disorders of sex development (DSD) required for severe hypospadias

1089

2. Biochemical tests
   ➡ Always consider disorders of sex development (DSD) in patients with hypospadias associated
   with bilateral non-palpable testes
   ➡ Evaluation in whom DSD is suspected

- Serum electrolyte to screen for salt-wasting form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia
- Ultrasound (USG) to look for internal genitalia such as presence or absence of uterus
- Karyotyping to determine the chromosomal pattern
  ○ XX virilization
  ○ XY undervirilization
  ○ Mixed sex chromosome pattern such as mixed gonadal dysgenesis XY/XO

VI. Treatment

1. General principles
   ➡ Goal of surgery = Create a penis with normal function and appearance with a urethral opening
   as close as possible to ventral tip of penis
   ➡ Timing of surgery = 6 months - 1 years
   ➡ Indications for urological referral and surgery

- Significant deflection of urinary stream
- Inability to urinate from a standing position
- Erectile dysfunction due to penile curvature leading to intercourse difficulties
  ➡ **AVOIDANCE** of circumcision
- Foreskin has to be preserved for hypospadias reconstruction to prevent fistula formation
  in standard and severe forms of hypospadias
- Anatomical configuration is not conducive to a safe circumcision using a Gomco or
  Plastibell device due to inability to properly place either device over the glans and have
  sufficient foreskin to complete the circumcision

2. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Primary tubularization

- **Procedure of choice** in standard hypospadias
- Tubularized urethroplasty with or without incision of the urethral plate (Tubularized
  incised plate (TIP))
- Creates a new urethra by rolling a ventral strip of penile shaft skin
  ➡ Onlay island flap
- Indicated in more severe forms of hypospadias
- Urethra is created by transferring a vascular strip of inner foreskin onto the ventral skin
  (urethral plate)
- Skin is sewn to the urethral plate in an onlay fashion hence the name of procedure
  ➡ Two-stage hypospadias repair
- Indicated in most severe forms of hypospadias
- 2-stage approach to straighten the penis and create a new urethral opening
- **1st operation** = Curved penis is corrected by insertion of dorsal midline plication sutures
  in the nerve-free zone at 12 o'clock position which straightens the penis + Excess dorsal
  foreskin is transferred to the ventral side of penis as the tissue is required for next stage
- **2nd operation** = Urethra is reconstructed using the transferred dorsal skin that is now on
  the ventral aspect of penis in a manner similar to primary tubularization
  ➡ Correction of penile curvature (chordee)
- Correction of penile curvature (chordee) is a critical step in hypospadias surgery
- Placement of a dorsal midline plication sutures in the nerve-free zone at 12 o'clock
- Allows preservation of sexual function without manipulation of penile innervation

# Undescended testes (Cryptorchidism)

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Cryptorchidism is the **MOST** common congenital abnormality of the genitourinary tract
   ➡Cryptorchidism by definition suggests a hidden testes which is not within the scrotum and does
   not descend spontaneously by 4 months of age (or corrected age for premature infants)

- Undescended testes
  - True undescended testes have stopped short along their normal path of descent into the scrotum
  - May remain non-palpable in the abdominal cavity (abdominal) or may be palpable in the inguinal canal (intracanalicular) or just outside the external ring (suprascrotal)
- Absent testes
  - Also known as the "vanishing testis syndrome" or testicular regression syndrome
  - Absent testes may be due to agenesis or atrophy secondary to intrauterine vascular compromise such as prenatal testicular torsion
- Retractile testes
  - Normal testes that have been pulled into a suprascrotal position by an exaggerated cremasteric reflex
  - Testes can be brought into a dependent scrotal position and will remain there if the cremasteric reflex is overcome (by holding the testes in the scrotum for at least one minute)
- Ascending testes
  - Testes are noted in a scrotal position in early childhood and then to ascend and become undescended (i.e. acquired undescended testes)
  - Represents testes that have enough laxity in the spermatic cord to reach scrotum in early childhood but become tethered in place and pulled out of scrotum as the child grows
  - Result from incomplete involution of the processus vaginalis, restricting spermatic cord growth and resulting in testes gradually moving out of its scrotal position during a boy's somatic growth
- Ectopic testes
  - Descend through the external ring but then are diverted to an aberrant position
  - May be palpable in the superficial inguinal pouch (most common), suprapubic region, femoral canal, perineum or contralateral scrotal compartment (least common)
    ➡Classification of whether testes is palpable
- Palpable testes (80%)
  - True undescended testis (suprascrotal/ intracanalicular) (75%)
  - Retractile testis (20%)
  - Ectopic testis (5%)
- Non-palpable testes (10-20%) → Surgical exploration necessary
  - True undescended testis (intraabdominal/ intracanalicular) (50%)
  - Absent testis (vanishing/ atrophic) (50%)
  - Ectopic testis

[Image of the number 1091, indicating the page number, located at the bottom right corner of the page.]

II. **Epidemiology**

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ Incidence of undescended testes

- 2 – 5% of full-term infants have undescended testes
- 30% of premature infants have undescended testes since testicular descend occurs at 28th weeks of gestation
  ➡ Majority of undescended testes will descend spontaneously during first 3 months of life
- Incidence of undescended testes decreases to 0.8% at 6 month
  - Spontaneous descent rarely, if ever, occurs after 6 month of age
- If the testes have not descended by **4 months**, it will remain undescended
  ➡ Cryptorchidism is bilateral in 10% of cases

III. **Etiology**

1. Causes of cryptorchidism
   ➡ Majority of undescended testes are idiopathic
   ➡ Associated conditions

- Disorders of sexual development (especially in _phenotypically male infants with bilateral non-palpable testes_)
  - Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (virilized girl)
  - Mixed gonadal dysgenesis
  - Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome
- Genetic disorders
  - Associated with diminished testosterone secretion
    - Kallmann syndrome
    - Klinefelter syndrome
    - Prader-Willi syndrome
  - Associated with primary hypogonadism and increased gonadotropin level
    - Noonan syndrome
  - Not associated with testosterone or gonadotropin
    - Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
- Abdominal wall defects
  - Prune belly syndrome

[Image Description: The image is a blank white page with the number "1092" written in the bottom right corner. The number is in a standard font and size, and is the only element on the page.]

IV. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Empty or hypoplastic/ Poorly rugated scrotum
   ➡ Most common location of undescended testes

- Suprascrotal (just outside the external ring)
- Intracanalicular (inside the inguinal canal)
- Abdominal

2. Consequences of undescended testes
   ➡ Indirect inguinal hernia

- Inguinal pain should raise suspicion of an incarcerated hernia or testicular torsion of an undescended testes
  ➡ Testicular torsion
- Torsion and infarction of the cryptorchid testes
- Inguinal pain should raise suspicion of an incarcerated hernia or testicular torsion of an undescended testes
  ➡ Testicular trauma
- From compression against the pubic bone
  ➡ Testicular cancer
- Risk of germ cell malignancy developing in undescended testes is 4x higher than in general population
- Contralateral testes is not at increased risk of malignancy
- Most common tumor developing in undescended testes is seminoma (65%)
- Peak age of developing testicular tumor is 15 – 45 years old
- Testicular tumor is less common if orchiopexy is performed before 10 years of age but they still occur and thus adolescents should be instructed in testicular self-examination
  ➡ Infertility
- Men with history of undescended testes have an increased incidence of lower sperm counts, sperm of poorer quality and lower fertility rates than men with normally descended testes

1093

V. **Diagnosis**

1. History taking
   ➡History of presenting illness (HPI)

- Whether the testes were in a scrotal location before
  - Testes that were in a scrotal location in the neonatal period are more likely to be retractile testes rather than truly undescended
    ➡Surgical history
- Previous inguinal surgery
  - Iatrogenic cryptorchidism related to mechanism tethering of testes or cord in scar tissues

2. Physical examination

[Image Description: An illustration of the male groin area with labeled anatomical structures. The structures include:

1. Abdomen
2. Inguinal canal
3. Suprascrotal (prepubic)
4. Suprapubic (penile)
5. Femoral region
6. Perinela region
7. Contralateral hemiscrotum
   The terms "Undescended testes" and "Ectopic testes" are labeled on the left and right sides of the illustration, respectively, indicating the locations of these conditions. The illustration shows the location of the different regions in the lower abdomen and upper thigh area of a male body.]

➡Testicular examination requires two hands

- One hand is placed near ASIS and the other hand on the scrotum
- First hand is swept from ASIS along inguinal canal to gently express any retained testicular tissues into the scrotum
  - True undescended or ectopic inguinal testes may slide or pop under the examiner's fingers during this maneuver
  - Low ectopic or retractile testis may be felt by second hand as the testis is milked into the scrotum by the first hand
- Hands can be lubricated with warm soap water ("soap test")
  - Soap is applied to examiner's hand and inguinal canal to reduce friction and facilitate identification of inguinal testes
    ➡Maneuvers to bring a retractile testis into the scrotum and to differentiate an ectopic from a retractile testis
- Holding the testis that can be manipulated into the dependent portion of scrotum in position for ≥ 1 min fatigues the cremasteric muscle
- After this maneuver a retractile testis will remain in the scrotum whereas an ectopic testis immediately springs out of the scrotum
  ➡ Look for contralateral testicular enlargement
- Unilateral non-palpable testis may suggest testicular absence or atrophy particularly after the onset of puberty
- One soft sign of a testis that is absent is contralateral testicular hypertrophy but this finding is not 100% diagnostic
  ➡Examination of inguinal canal
- Inguinal fullness may be associated with intracanalicular testis, inguinal hernia or inguinal lymphadenopathy
  1094

3. Radiological tests
   USG groin (inguinal)/scrotum
   - **NOT** routinely indicated in non-palpable testes since it lacks the sensitivity and specificity to alter the need for exploratory surgery (does **NOT** alters surgical management anyways)
   - Useful in obese boys
     - Intracanalicular testes may be difficult to palpate and will **CHANGE** the surgical approach from laparoscopic to inguinal

VI. Treatment

1. General principles
   Goal is to place and fix viable undescended testes in a normal scrotal position or to remove non-viable testicular remnants
   - Reduces the risk of infertility
   - Reduces the risk of testicular torsion and testicular trauma
   - Reduces the risk of testicular cancer
   - Permits easier examination of testis to detect testicular masses
   - Improves body satisfaction
     Timing of surgery
   - Plan for surgery as soon as possible if testes remains undescended at 4 months (QMH: 3 months)
     - If the testes have not descended by **4 months**, it will remain undescended
     - Surgery should be completed before 2 years old (ideally before 1 year) since it is associated with improved testicular growth and fertility potential

1095

2. Treatment for palpable testes
   ➡ Orchiopexy

- Performed through either an inguinal or scrotal incision
- Testis and cord are freed from surrounding attachments and testis is manipulated into the scrotum and sutured in place
- Possible if the testis is of normal size and testicular vessels are of adequate length
- Complications
  - Testicular atrophy (**most significant**) (related to ischemic injury due to dissection of testicular vessels or postoperative swelling and inflammation)
  - Reascent of testis (requiring repeat procedure)
  - Inguinal hernia
  - Infection/ Bleeding

3. Treatment for non-palpable testes
   ➡ Exploratory surgery

- Examination under anesthesia (EUA)
  - 1st step in the surgical management of clinically non-palpable testis
  - Testis may become palpable in the groin during EUA which avoids the need for further laparoscopy → Inguinal orchiopexy
  - Proceed to diagnostic laparoscopy if EUA is negative
- Diagnostic laparoscopy - Determine whether or not testis is present - Finding of blind-ending testicular vessels confirms an absent testis - ➡ Permits termination of procedure without a groin incision - Testicular vessels and vas deferens are visualized exiting the internal ring - ➡ Proceed to groin exploration to identify intraabdominal testis - Laparoscopic identification of intraabdominal testis - < 2 cm from internal ring = Laparoscopic orchidopexy (1-stage) - > 2 cm from internal ring = Staged laparoscopic orchidopexy (2-stage)
  ➡ Two-Stage Fowler-Stephens laparoscopic orchiopexy
- Indicated when diagnostic laparoscopy reveals a high testicle that cannot reach the scrotum without transection of testicular vessels
- 1st stage = Vessel transection
  - Ligation of spermatic vessels using a vascular clip
- 2nd stage = Orchiopexy
  - Performed after at least 6 months to allow collateral blood supply from peritoneum to develop
  - Testicles is brought to the scrotum based on the paravasal vascular supply using either open or laparoscopic technique

## Hydrocele/ Varicocele/ Spermatocele

I. Overview

1. Anatomy of scrotum

[Image of the male anatomy, including the kidneys, testicles, blood vessels, and related structures. The kidneys are at the top on either side of the body's midline, connected to the inferior vena cava and the aorta. The testicular arteries and internal iliac arteries are visible, leading down towards the pelvic region. The inferior vesical and epigastric arteries are also highlighted. The cremasteric artery and the artery to the ductus deferens are pointed out. Below, the testicles are visible, with the pampiniform plexus surrounding them. Key structures are labeled, including the left renal vein, inferior vena cava, testicular artery, internal iliac artery, inferior vesical artery, inferior epigastric artery, cremasteric artery, artery to ductus deferens, and the pampiniform plexus.]

➡Arterial supply

- Testicular artery (from aorta)
- Cremasteric artery (from inferior epigastric artery from external iliac artery)
- Artery to vas deferens (from inferior vesical artery from internal iliac artery)
  ➡Venous drainage
- Left testes = Spermatic vein (into pampiniform plexus into left renal vein)
- Right testes = Spermatic vein (into pampiniform plexus into IVC)
  ➡ Lymphatic drainage
- Testes = Para-aortic LNs which are retroperitoneal in location
- Skin of scrotum and penis = Inguinal LNs

II. Hydrocele

1. General features

[Image: Four diagrams illustrating different types of hydrocele: congenital hydrocele, infantile hydrocele, vaginal hydrocele, and hydrocele of the spermatic cord.

1.  Congenital hydrocele: The diagram shows a fluid-filled sac surrounding the testis and extending up into the inguinal canal. The sac is connected to the peritoneal cavity.

2.  Infantile hydrocele: The diagram shows a fluid-filled sac surrounding the testis and extending up into the inguinal canal, but the connection to the peritoneal cavity is closed off.

3.  Vaginal hydrocele: The diagram shows a fluid-filled sac only around the testis.

4.  Hydrocele of the spermatic cord: The diagram shows a fluid-filled sac along the spermatic cord, separate from the testis.]

**Communicating hydrocele** **Non-communicating hydrocele**

Collection of peritoneal fluid between parietal and visceral layers of tunica vaginalis which
directly surrounds the testis and spermatic cord
➡Etiological classification of hydrocele

- Primary hydrocele (= Idiopathic)
- Secondary hydrocele - Epididymitis/ Orchitis - Testicular tumour - Testicular torsion/Torsion of appendix testis or appendix epididymis/ Trauma
  ➡Anatomical classification of hydrocele
- Communicating hydrocele develops as a result of failure of processus vaginalis to
  obliterate during development and the fluid around the testes is peritoneal fluid
- Non-communicating hydrocele has no communication with the peritoneum and the fluid
  comes from the mesothelial lining of tunica vaginalis

  - Increase in size during the day or with Valsalva maneuver
- Non-communicating hydrocele - **NOT** reducible - Do **NOT** change in size or shape with crying or straining
  ➡ Scrotal pain
- Suggests that the hydrocele may arise from epididymitis, orchitis, testicular torsion,
  torsion of appendix testis or appendix epididymis or tumours

3. Diagnosis
   ➡ Physical examination

- Characterization of scrotal mass - Not separable from testes - Able to get above the mass - Transilluminate as cystic mass
  ➡ Doppler USG
- Indicated if clinical diagnosis is uncertain and to rule out a primary cause for hydrocele
  including acute inflammatory scrotal conditions and testicular tumour

4. Treatment
   ➡General approach

- Majority of hydrocele whether communicating or non-communicating do not require
  intervention and resolves spontaneously in neonates usually by 1 year of age
- Management of hydrocele in neonate younger than 1 year of age is supportive
  only unless accompanied by an inguinal hernia
- Indications for surgery - Congenital hydrocele in newborn that persists beyond 1 year of age - Symptomatic with pain or pressure sensation or when scrotal skin integrity is
  compromised from chronic irritation
  ➡Surgical treatment
- Lord's plication of the sac
  - Plication of the redundant tunica vaginalis
- Jaboulay procedure
  - Hydrocele sac is everted and anchored with sutures
- Aspiration + Instillation of sclerosants - Aspiration alone is usually unsuccessful due to rapid reaccumulation of fluid - Can be effective when combined with instillation of sclerosants such as alcohol or
  tetracycline - Higher rate of recurrence and risk of reactive epididymitis or orchitis - Makes subsequent open surgery more difficult due to development of adhesion
  between hydrocele sac and scrotal contents

### III. Varicocele

1. General features
   Collection of dilated and tortuous veins caused by dilatation of pampiniform plexus of spermatic
   veins which surrounds the spermatic cord in the scrotum
   ➡ Occurs at puberty in 15 – 20% of post-pubertal males
   ➡ Occurs more commonly on the left side (85 – 95%)

- Right spermatic veins enter IVC at an obtuse angle facilitating more continuous flow
- Left spermatic veins enter left renal vein perpendicularly at a 90° angle - Pressure within left renal vein is higher due to compression between aorta and
  superior mesenteric artery (SMA) known as “nut-cracker effect” - Increases pressure in the left testicular vein which can dilate and cause
  incompetence of the valve leaflets leading to retrograde flow of blood towards
  testes and dilatation of scrotal venous complex
  ➡ Classification of varicocele according to size
- Grade 1 (small) = Palpable only with Valsalva maneuver
- Grade 2 (moderate) = Non-visible on inspection but palpable upon standing
- Grade 3 (large) = Visible on gross inspection

2. Etiology
   ➡ Primary varicocele (= Idiopathic)
   ➡ Secondary varicocele

- Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with IVC thrombus
- Right renal vein thrombosis with clot propagation down the IVC
- Abdominal mass
  - Kidney tumours
  - Retroperitoneal tumours
  - Lymphadenopathy

3. Clinical manifestation
   ➡ Scrotal mass

- Dull aching scrotal pain
- Most noticeable during standing or Valsalva maneuver
- Decompresses and disappears in supine position
- Majority of varicoceles are usually left-sided - Bilateral varicoceles occur in 33% of patients - Unilateral right varicocele is rare and should prompt investigation of underlying
  pathology causing IVC obstruction (e.g. RCC with IVC extension)
  ➡ Testicular atrophy
- Secondary to loss of germ cell mass by induction of apoptosis initiated by slightly
  increased scrotal temperature
  ➡ Decreased fertility
- Precise relationship between varicocele and fertility is still unknown
- Varicocele are often identified in infertile men but men with varicocele may have normal
  semen parameters and fertility

1101

4. Diagnosis
   ➡Physical examination

- Testicular atrophy
- Characterization of scrotal mass
  - "Bag-of-worms" texture
  - Separable from testes
  - Able to get above the mass
  - Not transilluminable
  - Increases in size with Valsalva's maneuver
- Differentiate primary and secondary varicocele - Primary varicocele is more prominent on standing and disappear on supine - Secondary varicocele does not get much smaller with change in position from
  standing to supine
  ➡USG scrotum
- Indicated in patients with suspected IVC obstruction - Unilateral right varicocele - Varicocele that do not compress and diminish in supine position
  ➡CT abdomen with contrast
- Indicated in patients with suspected IVC obstruction
  - Unilateral right varicocele
  - Varicocele that do not compress and diminish in supine position

5. Treatment
   ➡General approach

- Majority of varicocele do not require intervention and managed conservatively with
  scrotal support and pain control with NSAIDs
- Indications for surgery - Large varicocele (Grade III) - Intolerable symptoms including pain, heaviness and swelling - Abnormal semen analysis with decreased sperm quantity and quality - Testicular atrophy (catch-up growth after surgery is possible and return of
  testicular size correlates with normal fertility potential)
  ➡Surgical testicular (gonadal) vein ligation
- Ligation of testicular vein so that retrograde blood flow can no longer reach the
  pampiniform plexus in the scrotum
  ➡Percutaneous testicular (gonadal) vein embolization
- Embolization with embolization coil or sclerosants
- Access through the femoral and common iliac vein
  1102

IV. **Spermatocele (Epididymal cyst)**

1. General features
   ➡ Painless fluid-filled cyst of the head of epididymis that may contain non-viable sperms
   ➡ Epididymal cyst that is > 2 cm is called a spermatocele

2. Diagnosis
   ➡ Physical examination
   • Characterization of scrotal mass
   ◦ Separable from testis
   ◦ Able to get above the mass
   ◦ Transilluminate as cystic mass
   ➡ USG scrotum
   • Differentiate epididymal cyst from epididymal cystadenoma which occurs in patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome

3. Treatment
   ➡ General approach
   • Majority of spermatocele do not require intervention and managed conservatively
   • Indications for surgery
   ◦ Large epididymal cyst (spermatocele)
   ◦ Intolerable symptoms such as chronic pain
   ➡ Surgical treatment
   • Surgical excision
   ◦ Risk of operative damage and fibrosis of epididymis lead to decreased fertility

V. **Summary**

1. Comparison between hydrocele, varicocele and spermatocele

# Urological Diseases

## Testicular torsion

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that can result in loss of testes

II. Epidemiology

1. General epidemiology
   ➡ 2 Peak incidences for torsion

- Neonatal period
- Defined as torsion that occurs prenatally and within first 30 days of life
- Puberty
- 65% between age 12 – 18 years old
- Secondary to increased weight of testes during pubertal development

- Vestigial remnant of the Mullerian duct system
  ➡Appendix epididymis
- Located at the head of epididymis
- Vestigial remnant of Wolffian duct

V. **Pathogenesis**

1. Pathogenesis of testicular torsion
   ➡Inadequate gubernaculum fixation of testis to the tunica vaginalis
   ➡Testis may twist on the spermatid cord
   ➡Consequences

- Edema of testicles and cord
- Venous compression and outflow obstruction
- Arterial occlusion leading to ischemia (↓ Arterial inflow)
  1106

VI. Clinical manifestation

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Scrotal pain

- Site: Testicular or scrotal
- Onset: Acute sudden onset and occurs several hours after vigorous physical activity, minor trauma to the testicles, coitus or straining
- Character: Constant
- Radiation: Lower abdomen
- Associated symptoms: Nausea and vomiting (90%)
- Time course: Awakening in middle of the night or in morning (cremasteric contraction with nocturnal sexual stimulation during REM sleep cycle)

VII. Diagnosis

1. History taking
   ➡ History of presenting illness (HPI)

- Fever
  - Infection such as epididymitis and orchitis
- Difficulty in voiding
  - Urinary tract infection (UTI)
  - Intraabdominal, pelvic or rectal mass
  - Spinal cord lesion
- Flank pain or hematuria
  - Renal stone causing referred pain in scrotum
- Abdominal pain with anorexia, nausea and vomiting
  - Testicular torsion causing referred pain in lower abdomen
    ➡ Social history
- Trauma history
  - Blunt scrotal trauma is common in adolescents
  - Severe trauma can cause testicular pain arising from testicular contusion, rupture or traumatic testicular torsion
- Sexual activity
  - Associated with epididymitis

1107

2. Physical examination

[Diagram of the male anatomy, showing the tunica vaginalis. The tunica vaginalis is a pouch of serous membrane that covers the testis. It is derived from the peritoneum and is located between the testis and the scrotum. The diagram shows the layers of the tunica vaginalis, including the parietal layer, the visceral layer, and the cavity between the layers. The diagram also shows the other structures in the scrotum, including the testis, the epididymis, and the spermatic cord.]

[Photograph of a scrotum exhibiting a blue dot sign. The image shows a bluish discoloration visible through the skin of the scrotum, indicating a testicular issue.]

➡ Inspection

- Tender, hard and swollen testis
- Erythematous, edematous and indurated scrotal wall
- Asymmetrically high-riding testis on affected side
  - Left testicle usually lie slightly lower than the right testicle
  - Elevation due to shortening of cord from twisting
- Long-axis of testis oriented transversely (transverse lie) instead of longitudinally
  - Known as bell-clapper deformity which is a common abnormality that predisposes to testicular torsion and is usually bilateral
  - Testes lack normal attachment to tunica vaginalis permitting increased mobility and rests transverse within the scrotum
- Presence or absence of ulcers, papules
- Presence of urethral discharge
  ➡ Palpation
- Technique of scrotal examination
  - Palpate the entire testicular surface by gently rolling it between thumb and forefingers
  - Epididymis should be palpated in posterolateral position and followed to the spermatic cord
  - Palpate for inguinal lymphadenopathy
- Cremasteric reflex
  - Distinguish testicular torsion from other causes of scrotal pain
  - Index of integrity of thoracolumbar erection center
  - Elevation of testis when stroking or gently pinching skin of upper inner thigh in normal individuals
  - Can be absent in normal individuals particularly if younger than 30 months
  - ABSENCE of ipsilateral cremasteric reflex in testicular torsion
- Prehn sign
  - Not a reliable distinguishing feature between torsion and other causes
  - Elevation of scrotal contents relieve pain in patients with epididymitis
  - Elevation of scrotal content aggravates or have no effect on pain in patients with testicular torsion
- Blue dot sign
  - Appendix testis is a pedunculated structure on anterosuperior aspect of testis
  - Infarction and necrosis of appendix testis can be seen as a "blue-dot" (21%)
- Transillumination test - Positive transillumination indicates hydrocele
  1108

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials
   ➡ Urinalysis

- Pyuria is common in epididymitis
- Gram smear, culture with sensitivity testing of urethral discharge or urine
  - Evaluation of STIs in patients who have consistent findings with sexually
    transmitted epididymitis

4. Radiological tests
   ➡ Color Doppler USG of scrotum

- Indicated if the cause of scrotal pain is clinically equivocal after history and physical
  examination and performance of imaging will **NOT** delay treatment
- Can proceed directly to surgical exploration if clinical signs are suggestive
- Diagnostic test to distinguish testicular torsion from other causes of scrotal pain
- Demonstration of decreased testicular perfusion or twisting of the spermatic cord

VIII. Treatment

1. Manual detorsion
   ➡ Indicated if surgery is not immediately available within 2 hours
   ➡ Manual detorsion should not delay surgery
   ➡ Techniques

- Appropriate sedation and analgesia should be administered
- Detorsion should be attempted by rotating it outward towards the thigh
  - Testis usually rotates medially during torsion
- Multiple rounds of detorsion may be required
- Surgical exploration is necessary even after clinically successful manual detorsion
  because orchiopexy **MUST** be performed to prevent recurrence and ensure residual
  torsion is relieved
  - Orchiopexy is to secure the testicles to the scrotal wall
- Successful detorsion is suggested by
  - Relief of pain
  - Resolution of transverse line of testis to a longitudinal orientation
  - Lowering of position of the testis in scrotum
  - Return of normal arterial pulsation detected with color doppler USG

2. Surgical detorsion and bilateral orchidopexy
   ➡ Testicular torsion is a clinical diagnosis and when clinical findings indicate a high likelihood for
   testicular torsion then the patient should proceed to surgical exploration directly
   ➡ Assessment of viability after surgical detorsion

- Warm up the testis with warm pads after detorsion and wait for 20 mins
- Dissection of tunica albuginea to look for presence of blood that comes out which
  indicates the testis is still viable
- Non-viable testes should proceed directly to orchiectomy
  ➡ Both the involved testis and contralateral uninvolved testis should be explored and fixated
- Bell-clapper deformity occurs in 5 - 10% of individuals and is usually a bilateral defect
- Fixation of contralateral testes to prevent future torsion

1109

3. Orchiectomy
   ➡ Performed when testicle is non-viable

- Detorsion within 4-6 hours = 100% viability
- Detorsion after 12 hours = 20% viability
- Detorsion after 24 hours = 0% viability

IX. Complication

1. Prognosis
   ➡ Testicular ischemia, infarction and atrophy

- Testicular viability appears to become compromised if ischemia lasts beyond 4-6 hours
- Testis suffers irreversible damage after 12 hours of ischemia and leads to infarction of testis with liquefaction requiring orchiectomy
  ➡ Infertility
- Infertility may result even with a normal contralateral testis
- Disruption of immunologic blood-testis barrier may expose antigens from germ cells and sperm to general circulation to develop anti-sperm antibodies

1110

# Neurological diseases

## Increased ICP

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Normal range of ICP - Adults = 10-15 mmHg (≤ 15 mmHg) - Young children: 3 -7 mmHg - Infants: 1.5-6 mmHg
   ➡Pathological range of ICP - **Intracranial hypertension:** ≥ 20 mmHg (threshold to intervene)
   ➡Intracranial components - **Brain parenchyma** = 80% + **CSF** = 10% + **Blood** = 10% - Monro-Kellie hypothesis - ICP is the function of the volume and compliance of each component - Pressure-volume relationship that keeps the dynamic equilibrium among the essential non-compressible components in the rigid skull - Decrease in one component should be compensated by increase in the other
   ➡Intracranial compliance - Interrelationship between changes in volume of intracranial contents and changes in ICP defines the compliance of intracranial compartment - Magnitude and rate of change of volume determines effect on ICP - Compensatory mechanisms allow volume to increase with minimal elevation in ICP - Displacement of CSF into thecal sac - Volume of cerebral venous blood by venoconstriction and extracranial drainage - Decompensation occurs when compensatory mechanisms are exhausted - Small increase in volume leads to an abnormally elevated ICP

1111

2. Causes of increased ICP
   ➡ Intracranial mass lesions

- Brain tumour
- Brain hematoma
- Brain abscess
  ➡ Cerebral edema
- Cerebral infarction
- Acute hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy
- Traumatic brain injury
  ➡ Hydrocephalus
- ↑ CSF production
  - Choroid plexus papilloma
- ↓ CSF absorption
  - Bacterial meningitis (leads to arachnoid granulation adhesions)
- Obstruction of CSF flow
  - Aqueductal stenosis
  - Tumour
    ➡ Obstruction of venous outflow
- Venous sinus thrombosis
- Jugular vein compression
- Neck surgery
  ➡ Seizure
  ➡ Idiopathic intracranial hypertension

[Image Description: The image shows a partial scan of a document page. It contains a bulleted list of causes of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The causes are categorized into intracranial mass lesions, cerebral edema, hydrocephalus, obstruction of venous outflow, seizure, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The text is black and the background is white. There is a page number at the bottom right corner.]

1112

3. Pathophysiology
   ➡Cerebral perfusion pressure

- Clinical surrogate for adequacy of cerebral perfusion - **CPP = MAP - ICP** (if ICP > JVP) (OR) **CPP = MAP – JVP** (if JVP > ICP) - CPP = Cerebral perfusion pressure - MAP = Mean arterial pressure (MAP) - ICP = Intracranial pressure - JVP = Jugular venous pressure
  ➡Cerebral blood flow
- **CBF = CPP/CVR = (MAP – ICP)/ CVR**
  - CBF = Cerebral blood flow
  - CPP = Cerebral perfusion pressure
  - CVR = Cerebrovascular resistance

**Cerebral autoregulation in hypertension**

[A line graph showing the relationship between cerebral blood flow (mL/100 g per min) on the y-axis and mean arterial pressure (mmHg) on the x-axis. The graph displays two curves, one labeled "Normotensive" in red and the other labeled "Hypertensive" in blue.

The Normotensive curve starts at approximately 50 mL/100 g per min at 0 mmHg, rises to about 75 mL/100 g per min around 50 mmHg, remains relatively constant between 50 and 150 mmHg, and then rises slightly beyond 150 mmHg.

The Hypertensive curve starts at a lower cerebral blood flow than the Normotensive curve, remaining relatively low until around 100 mmHg, where it starts to rise more steeply, surpassing the Normotensive curve after 150 mmHg and continuing to increase steadily with rising mean arterial pressure.]

➡Cerebral autoregulation

- Normotensive
  - CBF is normally maintained at a relative constant level by autoregulation of cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) over a wide range of CPP (50 – 100 mmHg)
  - Brain will be exquisitely sensitive to minor changes in CPP in cases of dysfunctional autoregulation due to stroke or trauma
- Hypertensive
  - Set-point of autoregulation is changed in chronic hypertension since the brain responds to increased BP by arterial vasoconstriction
  - Maintains tissue perfusion at a relatively constant level and prevent the increased BP from being transmitted to smaller and more distal vessels
  - Acute reduction of BP can produce ischemic symptoms in patients with chronic hypertension even if the final value remains within the normal range

1113

4. Signs and symptoms of increased ICP
   ➡ Symptoms

- Vomiting
- Headache
  - Usually early morning headache
  - Mediated via the pain fivers of CN V in the dural and blood vessels
- Blurring of vision
  - Visual blurring is often unilateral and brief (seconds) that clear completely
  - Occurs spontaneously with changes in positions which represents transient fluctuations in nerve head perfusion
  - Chronic papilledema can lead to progressive visual field loss in the form of peripheral field contraction and even blindness
- ↓ Consciousness
  - Local effect of mass lesion
  - Pressure on midbrain reticular formation

➡ Signs

- Cushing's triad = Hypertension + Bradycardia + Irregular respiration (late feature)
  - Hypertension: Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) = Mean arterial pressure (MAP) - Intracranial pressure (ICP) and thus CPP can be either maintained by ↑ MAP (hypertension) and ↓ ICP
  - Bradycardia: Baroreceptor activation by increased BP
  - Irregular breathing: Compression on brainstem
- Papilloedema (late feature)
  - Compression of optic nerve and central retinal vein
  - Compression and blockage of axoplasmic flow from retinal ganglion cell leading to accumulation of axoplasm in optic papilla (optic disc)
- CN III, IV, VI palsy
  - Binocular horizontal diplopia resulting from unilateral or bilateral lateral rectus palsy
  - CN VI is particularly vulnerable to the effects of increased ICP due its long course in the subarachnoid space and bend to enter the cavernous sinus
- Spontaneous periorbital bruising

5. ICP monitoring
   ➡General features

- Determine CPP by continuous monitoring of BP and ICP
  ➡Indications
- NO reliable clinical monitoring (e.g. sedation, muscle paralysis)
- Likely evolving conditions
- GCS score < 8
  ➡External ventricular drain (EVD)
- **GOLD STANDARD** of ICP monitoring
- Small catheter inserted through skull usually into lateral ventricles
- Connected to a closed collecting device to allow drainage of CSF
- Connected to a transducer to record ICP

6. General management of increased ICP
   ➡Resuscitation

- Airway: Intubation to maintain airway patency and prevent aspiration
- Breathing: Support of oxygenation to prevent hypoxemia
- Circulation: Blood pressure (MAP) control - BP should be maintained to maintain CPP > 60 mmHg - Large shift in BP should be avoided especially hypotension - Hypotension with hypoxemia induce reactive vasodilation and elevation in ICP - Hypertension should only be treated when CPP > 120 mmHg or ICP > 20 mmHg
  ➡Fluid management
- Patients should be kept euvolemic and normo-osmolar
- Hyponatremia is common in increased ICP particularly in subarachnoid hemorrhage
  ➡ Sedation
- Keeping patients sedated can decrease ICP by reducing metabolic demand, ventilatory asynchrony, venous congestion and sympathetic response of hypertension and tachycardia
- Propofol is commonly used due to short t1/2 and easy titration
  ➡ Position
- Head elevation for 30°-45°
  - Optimize carotid arterial flow and jugular venous drainage
  - Over-elevation of head will compromise carotid arterial flow and leads to an overall decrease in CPP (CPP = ↑ MAP - JVP)
  - Head elevation for 30° - 45° will improve venous drainage and decrease JVP and leads to an overall increase in CPP (CPP = MAP - ↓ JVP)
- Avoid excessive flexion or rotation of neck
  - Avoid jugular veins being twisted
- Avoid restrictive neck collar if not indicated
  [A mostly empty white page with only "1116" located at the bottom right corner]

7. Treatment of increased ICP
   ➡ Mannitol

- Osmotic diuretics reduce brain volume by drawing free water out of the tissue and into the circulation to be excreted in kidneys
  - Onset = 15 mins; Duration = 6 hours
- Frusemide can be used in combination or as alternative for diuresis
- Foley catheter insertion required
- Precautions
  - Mannitol can reduce intravascular volume and hence decreases BP and CPP
  - Avoided in patients with renal failure as it may lead to acute tubular necrosis
  - Avoided in patients with hypernatremia, osmolarity > 320 mmol/L, hypovolemia and congestive heart failure
    ➡Corticosteroids
- Indicated in increased ICP due to CNS infections and brain tumours
- **AVOIDED** in patients with cerebral infarction or hemorrhage and trauma
  ➡Barbiturates
- Pentobarbital is commonly used
- Mechanism
  - Reduce cerebral metabolism to ↓ demand for cerebral blood flow (CBF) and hence ↓ ICP
  - Alternation in vascular tone
  - Inhibition of free radical mediated lipid peroxidation
    ➡Anti-epileptic drugs (AED)
- Seizure can both complicate and cause increased ICP
- Indicated if seizures are suspected and prophylaxis for supra-tentorial lesions
- **NOT** recommended for infratentorial lesions (cerebellum)
  ➡Hyperventilation
- Mechanical ventilation to lower PaCO2 to 26 – 30 mmHg (Aim = 3.0 – 3.5 kPa)
- Only use as urgent intervention and respiratory rate should be tapered back to normal over several hours following therapeutic hyperventilation to avoid rebound effect
- Indicated in increased ICP that complicates cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage and brain tumours
- Mechanism
  - Vasoconstriction to decrease volume of intracranial blood
  - Respiratory alkalosis to buffer post-injury acidosis
- Precautions
  - ↑ Vasoconstriction → ↓ ICP → ↑ CPP → ↑ CBF (desirable)
  - ↑↑ Vasoconstriction (excessive) → ↑ CVR → ↓ CBF (undesirable)
    ➡ Hypothermia
- Mechanism
  - Reduce brain metabolism
  - ↓ Demand for cerebral blood flow (CBF) and hence ↓ ICP
    ➡Decompressive craniectomy
- Removes rigid bony skull to increase potential volume of intracranial contents
- Improves brain tissue oxygenation
- Complications
  - Herniation through skull defect
  - Spinal fluid leakage
  - Wound infection
  - Epidural and subdural hematoma

II. Hydrocephalus

1. General features
   ➡ Disorders in which excessive amount of CSF accumulates within cerebral ventricles or subarachnoid spaces which are dilated

2. Classification of hydrocephalus
   ➡ Obstructive (non-communicating) hydrocephalus
   _ Obstruction in CSF circulation leading to accumulation of CSF in cerebral ventricles
   ➡ Communicating hydrocephalus
   _ Impaired absorption of CSF leading to accumulation of CSF in cerebral ventricles

3. Pathophysiology
   [Image: A sagittal section of the human brain illustrating the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Key anatomical structures are labeled, including the superior sagittal sinus, arachnoid granulation, subarachnoid space, meningeal dura mater, right lateral ventricle, choroid plexus, interventricular foramen, third ventricle, cerebral aqueduct, lateral aperture, median aperture, fourth ventricle, and central canal. Arrows indicate the direction of CSF flow through the ventricles and into the subarachnoid space. The image highlights the production, circulation, and absorption of CSF within the brain.]

➡ Production of CSF

- CSF is secreted by choroidal plexus in each lateral ventricle
- CSF flows through interventricular foramina into 3rd ventricle
- Choroid plexus in 3rd ventricle adds more CSF
- CSF flows down cerebral aqueduct to 4th ventricle
- Choroid plexus in 4th ventricle adds more CSF
- CSF flows out 2 lateral apertures (Foramina of Luschka) and 1 medial aperture (Foramina of Magendie)
- CSF fills subarachnoid space and bathes external surfaces of brain and spinal cord
- At arachnoid granulations (villi), CSF is reabsorbed into venous blood of dural venous sinuses
  ➡ Pathogenesis of hydrocephalus
  _ ↑ CSF production
  _ Choroid plexus papilloma
  _ ↓ CSF absorption
  _ Bacterial meningitis (leads to arachnoid granulation adhesions)
  _ Obstruction of CSF flow
  _ Aqueductal stenosis \* Tumour

1118

4. Clinical manifestation
   ➡ Signs of increased ICP - Cushing's triad = Hypertension + Bradycardia + Irregular respiration - Papilloedema - CN III, IV, VI palsy
   ➡ Head deformity (infants) - Macrocephaly - Widely split sutures - Full or distended anterior fontanelle - Frontal bossing - Dilated and prominent scalp veins
   ➡ Growth and pubertal development - Accelerated pubertal development but disturbed growth

5. Treatment of hydrocephalus
   ➡ CSF shunting - Types of shunting - Ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt - Ventriculo-atrial (VA) shunt - Complications - Ventriculitis due to shunt infection - Mechanical failure due to obstruction of ventricular catheter - Overdrainage
   ➡ Third ventriculostomy - Perforation is made to connect 3rd ventricle to subarachnoid space - Indicated in obstructive hydrocephalus but NOT communicating hydrocephalus

➡Management

- Direct compression initially controls bleeding allowing close inspection of injury
- Simple laceration should be copiously irrigated and closed primarily
- Suturing for hemostasis
  - Percutaneous suture closure is adequate for short single-layer laceration
- Debridement and surgical toilet
  - Debridement and closure in operating room is indicated for laceration that is long or has multiple arms
  - Careful reapproximation of galea will provide a more secure closure and better hemostasis

3. Skull fractures
   ➡Classification of fractures
   • Linear skull fracture
   • Single fracture that extends through the entire thickness of the calvarium
   • Majority of linear skull fracture have minimal or no clinical significance
   • Depressed skull fracture
   • Closed (simple) = No scalp laceration is present over or adjacent to the fracture
   • Open (compound) = Scalp laceration over or adjacent to the fracture
   • Basal skull fracture
   • Involves at least 1/5 bones that comprise the skull base
   • Orbital plate of frontal bone
   • Petrous and squamous portion of temporal bone*
   • Cribriform plate of ethmoid bone
   • Sphenoid bone
   • Occipital bone
   • Occurs most commonly through temporal bone and are at high risk for extra-axial
   hematoma particularly epidural hematomas
   • Due to temporal bone's relative weakness and proximity of the middle
   meningeal artery and vein
   • Can cause a dural tear creating a communication between subarachnoid space,
   paranasal sinus and the middle ear with CSF leakage
   • Halo test: Allow drop of fluid to fall on absorbent surface like a tissue and the
   drop will form a double ring with a darker center spot containing blood
   component surround by a light halo of CSF if blood is mixed with CSF
   • Presence of ẞ2-transferrin in CSF
   • Complications
   • CN palsy
   • CSF leakage + meningitis
   • Traumatic aneurysm
   • Traumatic carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF)

  - Appears within hours or up to several days after trauma
- CSF rhinorrhea
  - Occurs in up to 20% of temporal bone fractures
  - Dural tear creating a communication between subarachnoid space, paranasal sinus and the middle ear with CSF leakage
  - Appears within hours or up to several days after trauma
- Hemotympanum
  - Blood behind tympanic membrane detected by otoscopy revealing blue to purple hue taken on by the tympanic membrane
  - Common in basal skull fracture involving the petrous ridge of temporal bone
  - Appears within hours of injury
- Anosmia
  - Fracture of the anterior skull base damaging olfactory nerve (CN I)
- Facial paralysis/ Ipsilateral deafness/ Vertigo
  - Fracture of temporal bone damaging facial or vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VII/ VIII)

1124

➡Management of skull fracture

- Open VS Closed skull fractures
  - Open skull fractures require repair of scalp and operative debridement
  - Closed skull fractures do not normally require specific treatment
- Depressed skull fractures
  - Craniotomy is required if depression greater than the cranial thickness
    - Fragment may overlap the edge of intact bone or may plunge completely below the level of adjacent normal skull
    - Inner cortex of bone fragments has multiple sharp edges that can lacerate dura. brain and vessels
    - Craniotomy is required to elevate the fracture, debridement of depressed bony fragments and devitalized tissue, repair dural disruption to obtain hemostasis followed by a course of antibiotics
  - Other indications of craniotomy include presence of intracranial hematoma and frontal sinus involvement
- Basal skull fracture - Asymptomatic patient requires no treatment - Intervention is required in those with an associated CN deficit or CSF leak - CSF leakage can be managed with elevation of the head of the bed ± lumbar catheter drain placed in lumbar CSF cistern to decompress the cranial vault and allow the defect to heal by eliminating normal hydrostatic pressure - Incidence of bacterial meningitis rises substantially if leak persists for 7 days - NO proven efficacy of antibiotic coverage for preventing meningitis in patients with CSF leaks - Traumatic cranial neuropathy can be managed conservatively with documentation of extent of impairment and signs of recovery - Patients with traumatic facial nerve palsy may benefit from a course of steroids within 48 – 72 hours - Failure to respond to steroids can be considered for surgical decompression of petrous portion of facial nerve
  1125

4. Penetrating injuries
   ➡General features

- Skull fractures sustained from penetrating trauma are considered open
- Different types of penetrating injuries - Missile (bullets or fragmentation device) - Non-missile (knives or ice packs)
  ➡ Diagnosis
- Skull X-ray
- CT brain
- Cerebral angiography - Must be considered if the object passes near a major artery or dural venous sinus
  ➡Management
- IV Antibiotics
  - Decreases the chance of meningitis or abscess formation
- Operative exploration
  - Remove objects extending out of the cranium
  - Debridement, irrigation, hemostasis and definitive closure

5. Close-head injuries
   ➡Concussion

- Defined as a temporary neuronal dysfunction following non-penetrating head trauma
  - Definitions vary some requiring transient loss of consciousness while others include patients with any alteration of mental status
- Neurological deficits resolve over minutes to hours and CT brain is normal
- Second-impact syndrome - Brain remains in hypermetabolic state for up to 1 week after injury and more susceptible to injury in the first 1 – 2 weeks after concussion - Patients should be informed that even after mild head injury they might experience memory difficulties or persistent headaches
  ➡ Contusion
- Defined as a bruise of the brain which represent small amounts of blood in injured parenchyma rather than coherent blood clots
- Occurs when the force from trauma is sufficient to cause breakdown of small vessels and extravasation of blood into brain
- Commonly involves the frontal, temporal and occipital poles
- Rarely cause mass effect unless edema develops around a contusion
- May enlarge or progress to frank hematoma particularly in the first 24 hours
- CT shows "salt and pepper" appearance
- Contre-coup injury - Contusions may occur in brain tissue opposite the site of impact - Results from deceleration of the brain against the skull
  ➡Diffuse axonal injury
- Caused by damage to axons throughout the brain due to rotational acceleration and then deceleration
- Axon may be completely disrupted and then retract forming axon balls
- Hemorrhage is classically seen in the corpus callosum and the dorsolateral midbrain

1126

## Epidural (EDH)/ Subdural (SDH)/ Subarachnoid hemorrhage

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡ Epidural hematoma (EDH) and subdural hematoma (SDH) are characterized by bleeding into spaces surrounding the brain or spinal cord

- EDH arises in the potential space between skull and dura
- SDH arises between the dura and arachnoid membranes

2. Classification of subdural hematoma (SDH)
   ➡ Types of subdural hematoma are arbitrarily defined by time from onset but there is no general consensus in literature for definition

- Acute SDH = < 1 week
- Subacute SDH = 1 – 3 weeks
- Chronic SDH = > 3 weeks
  - Occurs in patients without a clear history of head trauma as they may arise from minor head injuries
  - Collection of blood breakdown products which are at least 2 – 3 weeks old
- Acute-on-chronic SDH
  - Traces of white in CT are often seen due to small, recurrent hemorrhages into the collection
  - Small bleeds may expand the collection enough to make it symptomatic in which this phenomenon is known as acute-on-chronic SDH

| Etiology                               | Epidural (EDH)                                                                                                                                                                  | Subdural (SDH)                                                         |

   - ➡Head trauma (**most common**)
     - Road traffic accidents (RTA)
     - Falls
     - Assaults

III. Pathophysiology

1. Anatomy of the dura

[Detailed anatomical illustration of the dura mater and related structures within the skull. Key components labeled include:

- Dura mater (periosteal and meningeal layer): The outermost layer of the meninges, depicted as a thick covering adhering to the inner surface of the skull.
- Arachnoid mater: A delicate, spiderweb-like membrane beneath the dura mater.
- Pia mater: The innermost layer of the meninges, closely adhering to the surface of the brain.
- Superior sagittal sinus: A large venous sinus located at the top of the skull, shown collecting blood.
- Inferior sagittal sinus: Another venous sinus located lower in the skull.
- Subarachnoid space: The space between the arachnoid and pia mater, filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
- Bridging veins (cerebral veins): Veins that penetrate the subdural space to enter the sinuses.
- Middle meningeal arteries and veins: Vessels located along the lateral aspect of the dura mater.
- Diploic veins: Veins within the skull bones that connect to the venous sinuses.
  The illustration provides a cross-sectional view, highlighting the spatial relationships between these structures.]

IV. Pathogenesis

1. Epidural hematoma (EDH)
   ➡ Injury to **arteries** (85%)

- Middle meningeal artery (MMA)\*
  - Trauma to the skull base with associated tearing of middle meningeal artery (MMA) as it courses through the foramen spinosum
  - Results in hemorrhage over cerebral convexity in the middle cranial fossa
- Anterior meningeal artery (AMA) - Occurs in the anterior cranial fossa
  ➡ Injury to **veins** (15%)
- Dural sinus or confluence of sinuses in the posterior cranial fossa
- Middle meningeal veins
- Diploic veins

2. Subdural hematoma
   ➡ Injury to the bridging (emissary) **veins** that drain from cerebral cortex to dural sinuses\*

- Bridging veins are subjected to stretching and tearing during acceleration/ deceleration of the head because the brain shifts in relation to the dura which firmly adheres to skull
- Rupture of these vessels allow bleeding into space between dura and arachnoid membranes through which the vessels traverse
  ➡ Injury to **arteries** (20 – 30%)
- Injuries to small cortical arteries

1131

V. **Clinical manifestation**

1. Signs and symptoms
   ➡ Headache
   ➡Nausea and vomiting
   ➡Drowsiness/ Confusion
   ➡Aphasia/ Ataxia
   ⇨ Seizure
   ➡ CN palsy
   ➡ Hemiparesis

- Contralateral hemiparesis occurs with direct compression of cortex by hematoma
- Ipsilateral hemiparesis occurs with lateral displacement of midbrain caused by mass
  effect of hematoma which compresses the contralateral cerebral peduncle against the
  free edge of the tentorium ("false localizing sign")
  ➡Ipsilateral dilated pupil (anisocoria)
  - Uncal herniation with compression of CN III
    ➡Cushing's reflex
- Hypertension + Bradycardia + Respiratory depression/ irregularity

1132

VI. Diagnosis

1. Radiological tests
   ➡CT brain

- Most widely used imaging for acute head trauma owing to its speed, relative simplicity and widespread availability
  ➡MRI brain
- More sensitive than CT scan for detection of intracranial hemorrhage
- Used as an adjunct to CT when there is strong suspicion of SDH or EDH but no clear evidence of hematoma demonstrated by CT scan

[Image Description: The image shows several brain CT scans illustrating different types of intracranial hemorrhages. The first image shows a CT scan of the brain indicating an Acute epidural hematoma (EDH) in the right hemisphere. The second image also shows Acute epidural hematoma (EDH) in the left hemisphere. The third image contains two rows of images. The first row has three brain CT scans showing the stages of Subdural hematoma: Acute SDH, Subacute SDH and Chronic SDH. The bottom row shows two brain CT scans indicating Subarachnoid hemorrhage.]

1133

VII. Treatment

1. General principles
   ➡ Corticosteroids is **NOT** indicated and should be avoided following head injury since it is
   associated with increased acute mortality
   ➡ Terminology

- _Craniotomy_ = With return of bone flap
- _Craniectomy_ = Without return of bone flap to allow space for cerebral edema
- _Burr hole_ = Creation of hole for drainage
  ➡ Conservative treatment
- Serial CT brain and close neurological observation
- Indicated in patients with small hematoma and mild symptoms without clinical or radiological signs of elevated ICP or brain herniation
- Indications in EDH (if all of the following is met) - Hematoma clot volume < 30 cm³ - Maximum thickness < 1.5 cm - GCS score > 8
  ➡ Surgical treatment
- Indicated for patients with focal neurological signs and symptoms to prevent irreversible brain injury or death caused by hematoma expansion, elevated ICP and brain herniation

2. Treatment of epidural hematoma (EDH)
   ➡ Craniotomy + Hematoma evacuation

- Open craniotomy allows a more complete evacuation of hematoma

3. Treatment of subdural hematoma (SDH)
   ➡ Craniotomy + Hematoma evacuation

- Indicated for _acute_ SDH which consists of a thick congealed clot
  ➡ Burr hole drainage
- Indicated for _chronic_ SDH which consists of a viscous fluid with the texture and dark brown color similar to motor oil
- Should be attempted first to obviate the risks of formal craniotomy
- Single burr hole is placed over dependent edge of collection is made and the space is copiously irrigated until the fluid is clear
- Second burr hole is made more anteriorly if the collection does not drain satisfactorily due to containment by membranes
- Convert to open craniotomy in the following situations
  - SDH is too congealed for irrigation drainage
  - Complex of membranes prevent effective drainage
  - Persistent hemorrhage occurs that cannot be reached with bipolar cautery through the burr hole

III. Risk factors

1. Non-modifiable risk factors
   ➡ Advanced age
   • Particularly age > 80 years
   ➡ Sex
   • Higher risk at most ages for men compared with women
   ◦ Except for ages 35 to 44 years and > 85 years
   ➡ Race and ethnicity
   • Higher risk for blacks than for whites
   ➡ Medical history
   • Previous TIA or stroke
   ➡ Family history

2. Modifiable risk factors
   ➡ Hypertension
   • Promotes the formation of atherosclerotic lesions
   • Predisposes to the development of lacunar infarcts
   • Increasing BP could be a marker for other risk factors such as increasing body weight, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance and the metabolic syndrome
   ➡ Diabetes mellitus
   • Approximately twice the risk of ischemic stroke compared with those without diabetes
   • Risk of stroke associated with diabetes is higher in women than in men
   • Risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis
   • Increased risk of carotid plaque development
   ➡ Dyslipidemia
   • Cholesterol is an established risk factor for atherosclerosis but appears to be only a weak risk factor for ischemic stroke
   ➡ Smoking
   • Strong, dose-response relationship for both ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage
   • Elevated risk of stroke due to smoking declines after quitting and can be eliminated by 5 years later
   • Recommend smoking cessation for patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack who have smoked in the year prior to the stroke
   • Suggest avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke
   ➡ Alcoholism
   ➡ Lack of exercise
   ➡ Oral contraceptive use

VI. **Pathogenesis**

1. Pathogenesis of stroke
   ➡ Cerebrovascular disease is caused by one of the several pathophysiologic processes - Process intrinsic to vessels
   Ο Atherosclerosis/ Lipohyalinosis/ Inflammation/ Amyloid deposition/ Arterial
   dissection/ Developmental malformation/ Aneurysmal dilation/ Venous thrombosis - Process extrinsic to vessels and originate remotely
   Ο Embolus from heart or extracranial circulation
2. Morphological appearance
   ➡Pale infarction which is swollen and slightly softened - Blood cannot reach the area distal to obstruction and thus pale in appearance
   ➡ Hemorrhagic infarction - Reperfusion to ischemic part of the brain will lead to hemorrhagic appearance
   Ο Capillaries are damage during ischemia and can no longer stand the BP when blood
   flow is reestablished
   ➡Cracking and liquefactive necrosis
   ➡Resorption with replacement by fluid filled cavities
3. Histological appearance
   ➡Ischemic necrosis and death of neurons
   ➡Halo appearance around neurons (Pericellular edema) - Caused by edema in the early stage of cerebral infarct
   ➡Heavy infiltration of macrophages - Macrophages transformed into microglia cells to resorb the debris of dead neurons
   Ο Microglial cells have a rod-shaped nuclei
   Ο Foamy appearance of macrophages - Cracking
   Ο Dead tissue are resolved and replaced by CSF - Formation of fluid-filled cystic cavity
   Ο Complete resorption leaving cystic cavity
   ➡Reactive astrocytosis - Proliferation of astrocytes around the border of infarct - Astrocytes participate in the healing process in response to damage in brain - Aims to give support to the edge of infarct

- Syncope

VIII. Diagnosis

1. History taking
   ➡History of presenting illness

- Onset of symptoms
  - Time of stroke onset = Time that is LAST SEEN WELL rather than last seen unwell
  - Defined by the time the patient was last known to be awake and free of stroke symptoms if patients are unable to provide a reliable onset time
  - Essential to determine eligibility for intravenous tPA therapy (<3-4.5 hours) or endovascular thrombectomy (< 6 hours)
- Headache and vomiting
  - Favored a diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke compared with ischemic stroke
    ➡ Medical history
- History of epilepsy
- History of trauma
  ➡ Drug history
- Anti-coagulants
- Insulin
- Oral hypoglycemic agents
- Drug overdose or abuse

1146

2. Physical examination
   ➡National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)

- Stroke severity rating scale
  - Measures the neurologic impairment using a 15-item scale
  - Text version = [www.ninds.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NIH_Stroke_Scale.pdf](www.ninds.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NIH_Stroke_Scale.pdf)
  - Graphic version = [www.ninds.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NIH_Stroke_Scale_Booklet.pdf](www.ninds.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NIH_Stroke_Scale_Booklet.pdf)
- Interpretation - Score = 0: NO stroke - Score = 1 – 4: Minor stroke - Score = 5 – 15: Moderate stroke - Score = 16 – 20: Moderate – Severe stroke - Score = 21 – 42: Severe stroke
  ➡ Vital signs
- Temperature
  - Exclusion of meningitis, brain abscess, subdural empyema or infective endocarditis
  - Fever may contribute to brain injury in acute stroke patients
  - Infection should be treated vigorously
- Blood pressure (BP)
- Pulses
- Respiratory rate (RR)
- Consciousness level (GCS)
- SaO2 (Pulse oximeter) - Patient with increased ICP due to hemorrhage, vertebrobasilar or bihemispheric ischemia can present with decreased respiratory drive or muscular airway obstruction - Patients who are hypoxic should receive O2 supplementation to maintain SaO2 > 94%
  ➡Respiratory examination
- Auscultation - Basal crepitations
  ➡Cardiovascular examination
- Inspection
  - Xanthoma/ Xanthelasma
  - Purpura/ Ecchymosis
  - Signs of infective endocarditis
- Palpation
  - Peripheral pulses in neck, arms and legs
- Auscultation - Carotid bruit - Heart murmurs
  ➡Neurological examination

- Cranial nerve examination
- Sensation, muscle tone, power, reflex and gait
- Cortical signs (Aphasia/ Apraxia/ Agnosia/ Neglect/ Homonymous hemianopia)
- Cerebellar signs
- Speech

1147

3. Biochemical tests
   ➡ CBC with differentials

- Platelet count as baseline for fibrinolytic therapy
- Contraindications to fibrinolytics
  - Thrombocytopenia < 100 x 10^9/L
    ➡ Clotting profile
- PT/aPTT/INR as baseline for fibrinolytic therapy
- Contraindications to fibrinolytics
  - PT > 15s
  - APTT > 40s
  - INR > 1.7
    ➡ RFT
- Look for serum creatinine and eGFR level before proceeding to contrast imaging
- Hyponatremia
  - Following subarachnoid hemorrhage due to inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) or cerebral salt-wasting syndrome
    ➡ Lipid profile
- Baseline for statin therapy
  ➡ Blood glucose level\*\*
- **ONLY** the assessment of blood glucose **MUST** precede the initiation of IV alteplase
- Euglycemia should be maintained
- Hyperglycemia
  - Stress hyperglycemia is common in patients with acute stroke
  - Evidence indicates persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during first 24 hours after acute ischemic stroke is associated with worse outcomes than normoglycemia
  - Hyperglycemia augment brain injury by several mechanisms
    - ↑ Tissue acidosis from anaerobic metabolism
    - ↑ Blood brain barrier permeability
    - ↑ Free radical generation
- Hypoglycemia
  - Hypoglycemia can cause focal neurological deficits mimicking stroke
  - Severe hypoglycemia alone can cause neuronal injury
  - Important to check BG and rapidly correct low serum glucose at first opportunity
  - BG < 2.8 mmol/L is a contraindication to fibrinolytic
    ➡ Cardiac enzymes
- cTnT and cTnI

1148

4. Radiological tests
   ⇨ CXR

- Look for underlying lung pathology and aspiration pneumonia
- Usefulness of CXR in stroke setting without acute cardiac, pulmonary or pulmonary vascular
  disease is unclear and thus if obtained it should not delay treatment
  ⇨ ECG
- Baseline ECG is recommended but should not defer treatment
- Cardiac monitoring is recommended to screen for AF and other potentially fatal serious
  cardiac arrhythmia that would necessitate emergency cardiac interventions
  - Cardiac monitoring should be performed for at least the first 24 hours
- Look for baseline cardiac rhythm to detect arrhythmia that predisposes to embolic events
- Look for evidence of structural heart disease such as previous MI or LVH
  ➡Echocardiography
- Indicated for suspected embolic stroke and normal neurovascular imaging
- Detects cardiogenic and aortic sources for cerebral embolism
  ➡ Non-contrast CT scan (NCCT)\*
- ALL patients admitted to hospital with suspected acute stroke should receive brain imaging
  evaluation on arrival to hospital
- **Test of choice** for subarachnoid hemorrhage
- Sensitivity is similar to MRI for ischemic stroke and is more faster and readily available
  - CT can be normal in the first hour after symptom onset
- CT is not sensitive enough to detect small stroke and brainstem stroke
- Indicated to rule out contraindications to fibrinolysis
  - Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) which is an absolute
  - Frank hypodensity on CT > 1/3 MCA territory
- Early signs of infarction
  - Focal parenchymal hypoattenuation
  - Hypoattenuation involving ≥ 1/3 MCA territory
  - Hyperattenuation of large vessels (e.g. MCA occlusion)
    ("Dense MCA sign" which does not respond well to IV tPA)
  - Cortical sulcal effacement
  - Loss of gray-white differentiation in basal ganglia
  - Loss of insular ribbon
  - Obscuration of lentiform nucleus
  - Obscuration of Sylvian fissure
    ➡CT angiography (CTA)
- Non-invasive intracranial vascular study is recommended during for patients if either IA
  fibrinolysis or mechanical thrombectomy is considered **BUT** should not delay IV fibrinolysis
- More sensitive than non-contrast CT scan for detecting early brain infarction
- Detection of intracranial large vessel stenosis and occlusion by presence of filling defect
  ➡MRI angiography (MRA)
- More sensitive than CT scan for diagnosing ischemic stroke but CT is adequate for
  emergency management decisions in most cases
- Similar detection rate with CT scan for detecting hemorrhagic stroke
- Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MRI can be used as sole initial imaging modality to
  evaluate acute stroke patients including candidates for fibrinolytic treatment
  1149

➡ Doppler USG

- Doppler USG of carotid and vertebral artery to detect extracranial vessels
  - Detect carotid and vertebral artery stenosis
- Transcranial Doppler (TCD) to evaluate for intracranial vessels
  - Detect intracranial stenosis and emboli
  - Identify collateral pathway
  - Monitor reperfusion after thrombolysis
    ➡ Digital subtraction angiography (DSA)
- Invasive intracranial vascular study
- Recommended for diagnosis of small aneurysms as cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage and if non-invasive studies are inconclusive
  1150

IX. Treatment (Ischemic stroke)

1. General management
   ➡ Airway (A)

- Airway support and ventilatory assistance are recommended for the treatment of patients with acute stroke who have decreased consciousness or who have bulbar dysfunction that causes airway compromise
  ➡Breathing (B): Supplemental O2 therapy
- Supplemental oxygen should be provided to maintain SaO2 > 94%
- Supplemental oxygen is **NOT** recommended in non-hypoxic patients
  ➡Circulation (C): Blood pressure (BP)
- Patients eligible for fibrinolytics
  - BP should be carefully lowered using IV labetalol or nicardipine before fibrinolytic therapy is started
    - **Target BP:** ≤ 185/110 mmHg
  - BP should be maintained at < 180/105 mmHg for at least 24 hours after fibrinolytic therapy
- Patients not eligible for fibrinolytics
  - BP should **NOT** be treated acutely (permissive hypertension) unless hypertension is extreme as defined by > 220/120 mmHg
  - Careful lowering of BP by about 15% in the first 24 hours after stroke is recommended
- BP should be **CAREFULLY LOWERED** since some degree of BP elevation may be necessary to maintain cerebral blood flow to ischemic brain regions
- Restarting antihypertensive medications after first 24 hours after stroke onset is reasonable for patients with preexisting hypertension and are neurologically stable
  ➡Body temperature
- Source of hyperthermia should be identified and treated
- Antipyretic medications should be administered to lower temperature in hyperthermic patients with stroke
- Antibiotics should be started as required in possible infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections - Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics has **NOT** shown to be beneficial
  ➡Blood glucose level
- Hyperglycemia
  - Evidence indicates persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during first 24 hours after acute ischemic stroke is associated with worse outcomes than normoglycemia
  - Treatment of hyperglycemia with insulin is required and patients should be closely monitored to prevent hypoglycemia
    - **Target BG** = 7.8 – 10.0 mmol/L
- Hypoglycemia
  - Hypoglycemia with serum glucose < 3.33 mmol/L should be treated in patients with acute ischemic stroke

1151

➡ Diet and nutrition

- Enteral diet should be started within 7 days of admission after an acute stroke
- Swallowing assessment to screen for dysphagia before initiating any oral intake
  - Dysphagia is common after stroke and increases risk of aspiration pneumonia as well as result in poor nutrition and dehydration
- NG tube feeding is reasonable for patients with dysphagia in the early phase of stroke starting within first 7 days and to place percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) tubes in patients with longer anticipated persistent inability to swallow safely > 2-3 weeks
  ➡ Positioning and splinting to avoid aspiration, contractures, pressure nerve palsy, shoulder subluxation and pressure sores
  ➡ Avoid bladder over-distension and UTI with catheterization
- Routine placement of indwelling bladder catheters should **NOT** be performed due to associated risk of catheter-associated UTIs
  ➡ Avoid constipation or fecal impaction by high fiber diet and stool softeners

2. Medical treatment
   ➡ Fibrinolytic therapy\*

- IV Alteplase (tPA) 0.9 mg/kg with maximum dose = 90 mg given over 60 mins with initial 10% of dose given as a bolus over 1 min
  - Agents other than alteplase (tPA) should only be used in setting of clinical trials
  - Alteplase is a fibrin-specific agent
    - Initiates local fibrinolysis by binding to fibrin in a thrombus (clot)
    - Converts entrapped plasminogen to plasmin
    - Plasmin breaks up the thrombus into fibrin degradation products (FDP)
- **ONLY** the assessment of blood glucose **MUST** precede the initiation of IV alteplase
  - Treatment is time-dependent and thus IV tPA should not be delayed while awaiting for other hematological or coagulation testing if there is no reason to suspect an abnormal test
- Outcomes improve only if treated within 3 - 4.5 hours of symptoms onset
  - Treatment 0-3 hours of onset
    - 12% Absolute ↑ in good neurological outcome (minimal or no disability)
    - 4% Absolute ↓ in mortality
    - 5.8% Absolute ↑ in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)
  - Treatment 3-4.5 hours of onset
    - 7.4% Absolute ↑ in good neurological outcome (minimal or no disability)
    - 1.8% Absolute ↑ in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)
- Risk of recanalization > 4.5 hours
  - Capillaries in the infarcted area are damaged and the blood vessels are weakened
  - Recanalization increases hemodynamic stress to weakened vessels
  - Risk of hemorrhagic transformation
    - Capillaries within the developing infarct are increasingly damaged by ischemia with advancing time
    - Damaged vessels may bleed upon reestablishment of blood flow

  [Image of an arrow pointing to the right labeled "Antiplatelets"]

- Recommended to initiate within 24-48 hours of onset of acute ischemic stroke
  - Dosage = 160-325 mg once daily
  - Reduces mortality and recurrent stroke but increases risk of major extracranial hemorrhage
- Should be delayed until 24 hours later if IV alteplase (tPA) is given since
  - Increase risk of symptomatic ICH and may not improve functional outcome

[Image of an arrow pointing to the right labeled "X Anticoagulants"]

- Multiple guidelines recommend AGAINST the use of anticoagulation in acute ischemic stroke for reducing morbidity, mortality and recurrence
  - Clinical trials failed to show any beneficial effect of anticoagulation in acute stages
- ONLY indicated in the following situations

1154

3. Surgical treatment
   ➡ Intraarterial (IA) thrombolysis\*

- Eligibility of endovascular therapy = Initiated < 6 hours from symptoms onset
  - Endovascular therapy includes both IA thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy
  - Non-invasive vascular imaging is strongly recommended during initial imaging evaluation if endovascular treatment is considered but should not delay IV tPA
- Can be considered in patients with major ischemic stroke of < 6 hours duration caused by occlusion of MCA
  ➡ Mechanical thrombectomy\*
- Eligibility of endovascular therapy = Initiated < 6 hours from symptoms onset
  - Endovascular therapy includes both IA thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy
  - Non-invasive vascular imaging is strongly recommended during initial imaging evaluation if endovascular treatment is considered but should not delay IV tPA
- Patients who are eligible for IV alteplase (tPA) should receive treatment even if endovascular therapy is being considered
  - Addition of thrombectomy to IV alteplase (tPA) increases the odds of functional independence by 71% without change in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or mortality
- Mechanical thrombectomy with stent retriever is the 1st line endovascular treatment
  - Recommended over IA thrombolysis since a clinically beneficial dose of IA alteplase is not established and alteplase does not have FDA approval for IA use
  - Without stent retrieval = Mechanical debulking and aspiration of clot
  - With stent retrieval = Stent is deployed within and integrated into the clot and then stent-clot complex is removed
    - Allows rapid partial flow restoration before clot extraction
- Criteria to be met for mechanical thrombectomy
  - Age ≥ 18 years old
  - Causative occlusion of ICA or MCA segment 1 (M1)
  - Treatment can be initiated (groin puncture) within 6 hours of symptom onset
  - mRS Score = 0-1
  - ASPECTS ≥ 6
  - NIHSS score ≥ 6
    ➡ Decompressive hemicraniectomy
- Indicated in patients with space-occupying cerebellar infarction

- Indicated in malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) syndrome
  - Massive MCA territory infarct with eye deviation, dense hemiplegia and progressive drowsiness ± Unequal pupil size
  - Serial CT shows significant infarct with swelling and midline shift
    ➡X Carotid endarterectomy/ Carotid angioplasty with stenting
- Usefulness of urgent carotid endarterectomy is NOT well-established
- ONLY indicated in secondary prevention of stroke

4. Treatment of **acute** complications
   ➡Obstructive hydrocephalus - Obliteration of 4th ventricles leading to hydrocephalus - Ventriculostomy is recommended in treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to ischemic stroke - Placement of external ventricular drain (EVD) temporarily - Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial shunt (VA) shunt if permanent
   ➡Brainstem compression - Decompressive craniectomy (suboccipital) is indicated in patients with space-occupying cerebellar infarction causing neurological deterioration from brainstem compression
   ➡ Seizure - Recurrent seizure should be treated in patients after ischemic stroke - Prophylactic use of anticonvulsants is **NOT** recommended

5. Treatment of **chronic** complications
   ➡DVT prophylaxis (_ischemic stroke_) - SC Unfractionated/ LMW heparin in immobilized patients - Aspirin reasonable for prophylaxis in patients who cannot receive anticoagulants - Intermittent external (pneumatic) compression device reasonable for patients who cannot receive anticoagulants
   ➡Depression screening - Administration of a structured depression inventory is recommended routinely to screen for post-stroke depression - Patients diagnosed with post-stroke depression should be treated with antidepressants in the absence of contraindications and monitored closely to verify effectiveness
   ➡Speech therapist - Indicated for dysphagia or speech and language problems

1156

X. Treatment (Hemorrhagic stroke)

1. General management
   ➡ Airway (A)

- Airway support and ventilatory assistance are recommended for the treatment of patients with acute stroke who have decreased consciousness or who have bulbar dysfunction that causes airway compromise
  ➡Breathing (B): Supplemental O2 therapy
- Supplemental oxygen should be provided to maintain SaO2 > 94%
- Supplemental oxygen is **NOT** recommended in non-hypoxic patients
  ➡Circulation (C): Blood pressure (BP)
- High BP after ICH is associated with greater hematoma expansion, neurological deterioration and increased risk of death and dependency
- Patients with SBP between 150-220 mmHg and without contraindication to acute BP treatment, acute lowering of SBP to 140 mmHg is safe
- Patients with SBP > 220 mmHg, it is reasonable to consider aggressive reduction of BP with continuous IV drug infusion and close BP monitoring to lower SBP
- BP lowering agents include IV labetalol/ nicardipine/ hydralazine
  ➡Body temperature
- Source of hyperthermia should be identified and treated
- Antipyretic medications should be administered to lower temperature in hyperthermic patients with stroke
- Antibiotics should be started as required in possible infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections - Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics has **NOT** shown to be beneficial
  ➡ Blood glucose level
- Glucose should be monitored
- Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia should be avoided
  ➡Diet and nutrition
- Enteral diet should be started within 7 days of admission after an acute stroke
- Swallowing assessment to screen for dysphagia before initiating any oral intake
  - Dysphagia is common after stroke and increases risk of aspiration pneumonia as well as result in poor nutrition and dehydration
- NG tube feeding is reasonable for patients with dysphagia in the early phase of stroke starting within first 7 days and to place percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) tubes in patients with longer anticipated persistent inability to swallow safely > 2-3 weeks
  ➡Positioning and splinting to avoid aspiration, contractures, pressure nerve palsy, shoulder subluxation and pressure sores
  ➡Avoid bladder over-distension and UTI with catheterization
- Routine placement of indwelling bladder catheters should **NOT** be performed due to associated risk of catheter-associated UTIs
  ➡Avoid constipation or fecal impaction by high fiber diet and stool softeners
  1157

2. Medical treatment
   ➡Coagulopathy management

- Patients with severe coagulation factor deficiency or severe thrombocytopenia should receive appropriate factor replacement therapy or platelets respectively
- Discontinuation of medication + Reversal of anti-thrombotic agents is indicated if ICH is present or suspected
  - Antiplatelet → Platelet transfusion (?)
    - Usefulness of platelet transfusion in patients with a history of antiplatelet use is uncertain
  - Warfarin → IV Vitamin K + PCCs/ FFP
    - Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is recommended over fresh frozen plasma (FFP) since it has fewer complications and correct INR more rapidly
    - PCC is contraindicated in patients with active thrombosis or DIC and associated with 1% risk of thrombosis (e.g. DVT/PE/MI/Ischemic stroke)
    - Recombinant activated Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is **NOT** recommended since it does not replace all clotting factors and even if INR is lowered, clotting may not be restored in vivo
  - Unfractionated/ LMW heparin → Protamine sulphate
  - Direct thrombin inhibitors → Idarucizumab/ FEIBA/ PCC/ rFVIIa/ Activated charcoal/ Hemodialysis
    - _FEIBA_ = Factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity
    - Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is recommended over recombinant activated Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) due to lower risk of adverse thrombotic events
    - Activated charcoal can be used if most recent dose was taken < 2 hours earlier
    - Hemodialysis can be considered for dabigatran
  - Factor Xa inhibitors → FEIBA/PCC/rFVIIa/Activated charcoal
    - _FEIBA_ = Factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity
    - Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is recommended over recombinant activated Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) due to lower risk of adverse thrombotic events
    - Activated charcoal can be used if most recent dose was taken < 2 hours earlier
- Thrombolytics → Cryoprecipitate (includes Factor VIII)/ Anti-fibrinolytics (Tranexamic acid/ Aminocaproic acid)

1158

3. Surgical treatment (Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH))
   Overview

- Rationale for hematoma evacuation is to prevent expansion and herniation, decrease ICP and decrease hematoma-related mass effect
- Limited evidence to support routine surgical evacuation for
  - Most patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)
  - Most patients with supratentorial hemorrhage without neurological deterioration
- Indications of surgical evacuation
  - Cerebellar hemorrhage + Any one of the following
    - Patient with neurological deterioration
    - Brainstem compression
    - Hydrocephalus from ventricular obstruction
  - Supratentorial hemorrhage + Any one of the following
    - Patient with neurological deterioration
    - Patient in coma, have large hematoma causing significant midline shift or has elevated ICP refractory to medical treatment
    - Patients with higher level of consciousness (GCS 9 – 12) in which early surgical intervention may be considered

Open craniotomy/Decompressive craniectomy with hematoma (clot) evacuation

- Open craniotomy is the most standard and widely studied technique in patients with supratentorial ICH
- Other methods of clot evacuation include CT-guided stereotactic aspiration or endoscopic aspiration with or without thrombolytic usage
- Decompressive craniectomy with or without hematoma (clot) evacuation might reduce mortality for patients who are in a coma, have large hematoma causing significant midline shift or has elevated ICP refractory to medical treatment

4. Surgical treatment (Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH))
   Overview

- Patient after aneurysmal SAH is at substantial risk of rebleeding
  - 3 – 4% in the first 24 hours
  - 1 – 2% each day in the first month
- Aneurysmal rupture is associated with a mortality of 70%

Surgical clipping (OR) Endovascular coiling

- Aneurysm repair is the only effective treatment to prevent this occurrence and should be performed within 24 to 72 hours when possible

5. Treatment of acute complications
   ➡Increased ICP

- Elevation of head of the bed to 30°
- Intravenous mannitol (osmotic diuretic) is the treatment of choice to lower ICP
- Corticosteroids should **NOT** be administered in patients with elevated ICP in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)
  - Dexamethasone does **NOT** improve outcome but increase complication rate primarily infection
- Consider invasive monitoring and treatment of ICP for patients with GCS < 8, those with clinical evidence of transtentorial herniation or those with significant intraventricular hemorrhage or hydrocephalus - Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) should b maintained at 50 – 70 mmHg depending on the status of cerebral autoregulation
  ➡ Seizure
- Clinical seizure and patients with a change in mental status who are found to have electrographic seizure on EEG should be treated with anticonvulsants
- Prophylactic use of anticonvulsants is **NOT** recommended

6. Treatment of chronic complications
   ➡DVT prophylaxis (hemorrhagic stroke)

- Intermittent external (pneumatic) compression starting the day of hospital admission
- Consider unfractionated/ LMW heparin in patients who lack mobility after 1 – 4 days of hemorrhage onset and who have documented cessation of bleeding

1160

XI. Prevention

1. Secondary prevention
   ➡Lifestyle modification

- Smoking cessation
- Avoid heavy alcohol use
- Moderate to vigorous aerobic physical activity for average of 40 mins 3 - 4x/week
  ➡ Antiplatelets
- Indicated in patients following **NON-cardioembolic** stroke or TIA
  - Antiplatelets is recommended over anticoagulants in non-cardioembolic stroke
  - Anticoagulation appears to increase adverse events without increased benefits compared to aspirin in non-cardioembolic stroke
- **Aspirin** = Decreases death and recurrence of stroke
- **Clopidogrel** = Marginally superior to aspirin with slight increase in risk of ICH
- **Aspirin + Clopidogrel** - NOT usually recommended for long-term secondary prevention of stroke - Can be considered if initiated ≤ 24 hours after minor ischemic stroke or TIA and continued for 90 days - Extended regimen is not shown to be more effective and will increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage
  ➡Anticoagulants
- Indicated in patients following **cardioembolic** stroke or TIA
  - Anticoagulants is recommended over antiplatelets in cardioembolic stroke
  - Anticoagulants reduce the risk of recurrence of stroke
  - Withhold anticoagulation in large stroke for 2-4 weeks given the risk of hemorrhagic conversion
- Some guidelines recommend NOACs over warfarin
- Warfarin is recommended over NOACs for any of the following - Mechanical prosthetic valve - Estimated GFR (eGFR) = 15-30 mL/min/1.73m² - Rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS)
  ➡Antihypertensives
- Treat previously untreated patients with BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg
- Target BP should be individualized but reasonable to be < 140/90 mmHg or SBP < 130 mmHg in patients with recent lacunar stroke
  ➡Statins
- Use statins with intensive lipid-lowering effect to reduce risk of stroke and cardiovascular events in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA of presumed atherosclerotic origin

1161

➡ Carotid endarterectomy (Carotid revascularization)

- Symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis of ≥ 70–99% and a life expectancy of ≥ 5 year who meet all of the following criteria
  - Surgically accessible carotid lesion
  - No prior ipsilateral endarterectomy
  - Absence of clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary or other disease that would greatly increase the risk of anesthesia and surgery
  - Overall morbidity and mortality rate associated with carotid endarterectomy should be low (< 6% in symptomatic patients; < 3% in asymptomatic patients)
- Moderate carotid artery stenosis of 50–69% also has slight benefit for carotid endarterectomy
  ➡ Carotid angioplasty and stenting (Carotid revascularization)
- Alternative to carotid endarterectomy
- Indications
  - Surgically inaccessible location (high bifurcation)
  - Radiation-induced stenosis
  - Restenosis after endarterectomy
  - Clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary or other disease that greatly increases the risk of anesthesia and surgery

  ➡ Predictors of post-stroke depression
- Disability
- Anxiety
- Pre-stroke depression
- Cognitive impairment
- ↑↑ Severity of stroke
  [Image Description: The page ends with the number "1163" at the bottom right corner]

3. Stroke rehabilitation
   ➡ All patients with stroke should be assessed for their rehabilitation needs and admission to organized rehabilitation programs - Initiated within 48 hours after acute admission of stroke and continuous after discharge
   ➡ Aims and objectives - Achieve highest possible functional level - Reintegration into community
   ➡ Assessment of impairments - Communication and motor impairments - Cognitive deficits - Visual and spatial deficiency - Psychological deficits - Sensory deficits
   ➡ Components of rehabilitation processes - Trainings - ADL/ Vocational/ Cognitive/ Communication trainings - Psychosocial interventions - Management of complications - Hemiplegia/ Spasticity/ Dysphagia/ Seizures/ Bladder and bowel dysfunction/ Depression and neurobehavioral syndrome - Prevention of complications - Aspiration pneumonia/ Contractures/ Shoulder injury/ Pressure sores/ UTI

➡ Hemorrhage (Hyperintense lesion)

Q3: What are the common risk factors for a cerebral infarction?
➡ Hypertension
➡ DM
➡ Smoking
➡ Hyperlipidemia
➡ Strong family history of strokes

1164

Case 2
A 35-yaer-old right-handed woman presented with sudden onset of confused speech and poor communication
for 3 days. She was a new immigrant to Hong Kong and lived in an apartment of a private housing estate, with
her 60-year-old husband and 2 teenage children from his first marriage. She was brought up in a farming
village, did not have any major illness in the past and was a NSND. However, her exercise tolerance was not as
good as her peers. So she could not perform heavy manual farm work like others in her family. 3 days ago, she
was found to have confused speech with difficult in verbal communication. Her husband thought that she had
flu and kept her at home. As there was no improvement, she was brought to the A&E department and then
admitted to a medical ward. Before the current episode, she complained of palpitations especially with exertion,
and her exercise tolerance was limited to 2 flights of stairs. She was not on oral contraceptive pills. She had no
fever, flu-like symptoms, constitutional upset, or motor weakness.

Physical examination shows she was alert, conscious, and afebrile. Her BP was 110/60 mmHg. She had a totally
irregular, small volume pulse with a rate of 90 per minute. All peripheral pulses were felt. The apex was not
displaced, and there was parasternal heave but no thrill was detected. On auscultation, the apical rate was 110/
minute. S1 was normal, the pulmonic component of her S2 was loud and there was a grade 3/5 pan-systolic
murmur best heard at apex radiating to the axilla and a grade 3/5 apical mid-diastolic murmur, which was
louder with her lying in left lateral position. Neurological examination was difficult, as she failed to understand
instruction. Her spontaneous speech and naming of objects were fluent. Examination of her CN is normal, and
muscle bulk, tone and power in her limbs were entirely normal. Her reflexes were symmetrical, both plantar
responses were down-going, coordination was normal and sensations were intact. All other systems were
normal.
Q1: What are the diagnosis and on what grounds are they made?

- ➡ CVS system
  - Mixed mitral valve disease
  - Pulmonary hypertension
  - Atrial fibrillation
- ➡ CNS system
  - Wernicke's aphasia from a cardioembolic stroke - Ο Posterior part of the left superior temporal gyrus - Supported by the history of reduced exercise tolerance, palpitation (AF), mixed mitral valve disease and sudden onset of fluent aphasia
    Q2: What suggests this diagnosis on physical examination?
- ➡ CVS system
  - Pan-systolic murmur at apex radiating to axilla suggest mitral regurgitation
  - Mid-diastolic murmur with postural accentuation suggest mitral stenosis
  - Irregular pulse with higher apical rate than pulse suggest atrial fibrillation
  - Parasternal heave and loud pulmonic component of S2 suggest pulmonary hypertension
- ➡ CNS system
  - Fluent aphasia with normal neurological examination suggest stroke affecting Wernicke's area
    [Page Break]

Q3: Clinically how do you determine the severity of mitral stenosis versus mitral regurgitation in patients
with mixed mitral valve disease?
➡Features suggesting predominant mitral stenosis

- Small volume pulse
- Undisplaced tapping cardiac apex
- Long diastolic murmur
- Pulmonary hypertension
  ➡Features suggesting predominant mitral regurgitation
- Displaced cardiac apex
- Palpable systolic thrill
  Q4: How would you investigate the patient?
  ➡ Blood test
- Complete blood count (CBC)
- Liver function test (LFT)
- Renal function test (RFT)
- Coagulation test
- Fasting glucose and lipids
  ➡Neurological examination
- CT/MRI brain
  - Show infarct over Wernicke's are to exclude hemorrhage, tumour or other lesion
    ➡Cardiological examination
- CXR
  - Assess heart size and lung fields
- ECG
  - Atrial fibrillation
- Echocardiogram
  - Assess mitral stenosis and regurgitation
  - Assess left atrial size, presence of intra-cardiac thrombus or vegetation in any valve
    Q5: What are the potential risks of rheumatic mitral valve disease?
    ➡Heart failure
    ➡Pulmonary hypertension
    ➡Infective endocarditis
    ➡Systemic and cerebral embolization
    ➡Systemic and cerebral hemorrhage from long-term anticoagulation
    Q6: How would you treat the patient?
    ➡Long-term anticoagulation
    ➡Speech therapy
    1166

Q7: What advice would you give to the patient?
➡ Antibiotic prophylaxis before surgical procedure
➡ Adherence to long-term anticoagulation
➡ Remarks

- Dietary modification
- Drug compliance
- Need for regular monitoring

Q8: Where is the Wernicke's area?
➡ Posterior part of the left superior temporal gyrus
➡ Lesion involving this area will lead to Wernicke's (receptive) aphasia

Q9: Would there be any concern about performing an MRI examination if she had received valvular
surgery?
➡ Metallic artificial heart valve may or may not be compatible with MRI examination
[Image Description: This page contains three questions and their answers, laid out in a simple question-and-answer format. Each question is followed by answers indicated by a right arrow symbol. The first question discusses advice for a patient, listing antibiotic prophylaxis, adherence to anticoagulation, and remarks including dietary modification, drug compliance, and monitoring. The second question identifies the Wernicke's area as the posterior part of the left superior temporal gyrus, noting that a lesion there can cause receptive aphasia. The third question raises concern about MRI examination post-valvular surgery, mentioning that metallic artificial heart valves might be incompatible.]

# Cardiothoracic diseases

# Valvular heart surgery

1. Overview
   1. Overview
      ➡ Valve repair is usually preferred over valve replacement since native valve is always better than artificial heart valves
   - Less infective endocarditis (IE)
   - Less heart function affected
   - Better quality of life (QOL)

2. Terminology
   ➡ Valvulotomy/ Valvuloplasty/ Commissurotomy
   - Indicated for valvular stenosis
   - **Valvulotomy** = Splitting of stenotic valve
   - **Valvuloplasty** = Reconstruction of valve leaflet and chordae tendinae
     ➡ Annuloplasty
   - Indicated for valvular incompetence (insufficiency)
   - **Annuloplasty** = Reduction of dilated annulus by suture or rings
   - Procedure to tighten or reinforce the ring around a valve (annulus) in the heart or with ring prosthesis

3. Different approaches to valvular heart replacement
   ➡ Open heart surgery
   - Cardiopulmonary bypass required
   - Median sternotomy is the most common approach to perform MVR or MV repair
   - Potential problems - Larger wound - Wound infection - Requires 10 weeks for bone healing - NO weight-bearing exercise
     ➡ Minimally-invasive surgery
   - Paramedian approach
   - Hemisternotomy approach
   - Thoracotomy approach
   - Robotic-assisted approach

1168

II. Comparison between mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves

1. Differences between different heart valves

|                   | Mechanical                         | Bioprosthetic                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Usage rate        | 60%                                | 40%                                                        |
| Durability        | Very durable lasting 20 – 30 years | Less durable lasting < 20 years                            |
| Thrombogenic risk | Higher                             | Lower (minimal)                                            |
| Anticoagulation   | Lifelong                           | Short-term required (at least 3 months and up to 6 months) |

2. Indications of mechanical heart valves
   Age of the patient

- Life expectancy > 10 years
- Age < 50 years old in general if no contraindication to anticoagulation for either aortic or mitral valve replacement
- Age < 60 years old for aortic valve prosthesis (both acceptable if 60 - 65 years old)
- Age < 65 years old for mitral valve prosthesis (both acceptable if 65 - 70 years old)
  Patients who do NOT have contraindications to long-term anticoagulation such as
- Compliance concern
- Increased bleeding risk due to comorbidities
- Lifestyle and occupational conditions
  Patients already on long-term anticoagulation due to high risk of thromboembolism
- Atrial fibrillation (AF)
- Previous thromboembolism
- Hypercoagulability states

3. Indications of bioprosthetic heart valves
   Age of the patient

- Life expectancy < 20 years or lower than presumed durability of bioprosthesis
- Age > 70 years old in general if no contraindication to anticoagulation for either aortic or mitral valve replacement
- Age > 65 years old for aortic valve prosthesis (both acceptable if 60 - 65 years old)
- Age > 70 years old if mitral valve prosthesis (both acceptable if 65 - 70 years old)
  Patients who have contraindications to long-term anticoagulation such as
- Previous major bleed
- Compliance concern
- Increased bleeding risk due to comorbidities
- Lifestyle and occupational conditions
  Female of reproductive age contemplating pregnancy
- Patients cannot receive warfarin in case of future pregnancy due to potential teratogenicity

Remarks: BOTH mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves are reasonable in patients aged 50–70 years old provided that there are no contraindications to anticoagulation (with bioprosthetic heart valves associated with 2x risk of reoperation but 1/2x risk of bleeding and stroke)

III. **Antithrombotic prophylaxis**

1. Mechanical heart valves (Regimen = Lifelong aspirin + Lifelong warfarin)
   ➡ Aspirin

- Aspirin 75 – 100 mg/day is recommended in addition to anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in patients with mechanical valve prosthesis
- Possible exceptions include history of GI bleeding, uncontrolled hypertension, erratic INR or age > 80 years old
  ➡ Warfarin
- Anticoagulation with warfarin (VKA) with INR monitoring is recommended in patients with mechanical valve prosthesis
  - Do **NOT** use NOACs including direct thrombin inhibitors or Factor Xa inhibitors in patients with mechanical heart valve prosthesis due to excess thromboembolic and bleeding events
- Target INR is based on type of valve replacement
  - Target **INR = 2.5** (_Range_ = 2 – 3) in patients with mechanical aortic valve replacement (**AND**) no risk factors for thromboembolism
  - Target **INR = 3.0** (_Range_ = 2.5 – 3.5) in patients with mechanical mitral valve replacement (**OR**) risk factors for thromboembolism
    - **Risk factors for thromboembolism =** AF/ Previous thromboembolism/ Hypercoagulability/ LV dysfunction with LVEF < 30 – 35%)

2. Bioprosthetic heart valves (Regimen = Lifelong aspirin + 3 – 6 months warfarin)
   ➡ Aspirin

- Aspirin 75 – 100 mg/day is reasonable in all patients with bioprosthetic valve prosthesis
- Possible exceptions include history of GI bleeding, uncontrolled hypertension, erratic INR or age > 80 years old
  ➡ Warfarin
- Anticoagulation with warfarin (VKA) to achieve target **INR = 2.5 for ≥ 3 months and up to 6 months** is reasonable after surgical bioprosthetic aortic or mitral valve replacement in patients with low risk of bleeding

3. Periprocedural bridging of anticoagulation in patients with mechanical heart valves
   ➡ AV replacement without risk factors for thromboembolism

- Discontinue warfarin 2 – 4 days before surgery
- Restart warfarin 12 – 24 hours after surgery
  ➡ MV replacement or AV replacement with risk factors for thromboembolism
- Discontinue warfarin and start UFH (preferred to LMWH) when INR reaches < 2.0
- Discontinue UFH 4 – 6 hours preoperatively
- Restart UFH and warfarin as soon as possible postoperatively

4. Correction of over-anticoagulation
   ➡Patients with **NO** bleeding

- Withhold warfarin if INR = 5 – 10
- Withhold warfarin and give PO Vitamin K 1 – 2.5 mg if INR > 10
  ➡Patients with bleeding
- Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)/ Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC)
- - IV Vitamin K at low dose of 1 mg

1170

IV. Complications of valve replacement

1. Complications
   ➡Structural failure

- Up to 30% rate for bioprosthetic heart valves within 10 - 15 years
- Mitral valve is more commonly affected than aortic valve
  ➡ Infective endocarditis (IE)
- May be complicated by valvular abscess and conduction system dysfunction
  ➡ Paravalvular leak
- Small central jet or regurgitation is normal in mechanical valves
- Valvular leakage can be due to patient prosthesis mismatch meaning the heart valve that is too small for the size of patients
  ➡ Obstruction
- Acute obstruction
  - Thrombosis\* of prosthetic heart valves
  - Left-sided valvular thrombosis
    - Surgery is indicated in left-sided lesion and severe symptoms
    - Fibrinolytics successful in 70% of cases but associated with 14% stroke
    - Consider UFH + Fibrinolytics if mild symptoms and small clot burden or poor surgical candidates
  - Right-sided valvular thrombosis
    - Fibrinolytics reasonable in right-sided lesion
- Chronic obstruction - Pannus\* formation which refers to tissue growth into prosthetic heart valves or supporting structures - Develops months to years after valve implantation and must be removed surgically
  ➡Embolization
- Risk highest in the first 90 days postoperative
- Around 1% per year even when patients with warfarin - Compared with 2% with aspirin or 4% if without medications - MV mechanical valve replacement is associated with 2x risk than AV replacement
  ➡ Bleeding
- Related to anticoagulation
  ➡ Hemolysis
- Especially with caged-ball valves or paravalvular leak

# Plastic surgery diseases

## Reconstruction in surgery

I. **Reconstructive ladder**

1. Overview
   ➡Healing by secondary intention
   - Dressings should be utilized to maintain a clean protected wound
   - Contraindicated in exposed critical structures, prolonged anticipated period of healing > 3 weeks or undesirable cosmetic consequences
   - Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) - Can be used to promote healing process - Contraindicated in ischemic wounds, infected wounds, inadequately debrided tissue beds and presence of underlying malignancy
     ➡Primary closure
   - Often have the best cosmetic results
   - Care must be taken to eliminate tension and prevent displacement of neighbouring structures
     ➡ Skin grafting
   - Requires a healthy, vascularized, uninfected wound bed and an available donor site
   - Bare tendon, desiccated bone or cartilage or radiation-damaged tissue will not support skin graft survival
     ➡Local tissue transfer (flaps)
   - Local tissue transfer of skin, fascia and muscle may be used in regions with nearby healthy tissues
     ➡Distant tissue transfer (flaps)
   - Move healthy tissues into the wound bed while leaving it attached to its native blood supply and requires subsequent division of the pedicle
   - Rarely used as it requires long-term immobilization and multiple procedures
     ➡Free tissue transfer
   - Requires microvascular anastomosis but may allow single-stage wound closure
   - Often has an acceptable cosmetic outcomes

[Image Description: The number 1172 is at the bottom right of the page]
1172

II. Skin grafts

1. Overview
   ➡ Skin is comprised of 5% epidermis and 95% dermis

- Dermis contains sebaceous glands
- Subcutaneous tissue contains sweat glands and hair follicles
  ➡ Graft healing
- Day 1-2: Imbibition
  - Diffusion of nutrients from the wound bed
  - Thin film of fibrin and plasma separates the graft from underlying wound bed
  - Thin film provides nutrients and oxygen to the graft as well as a moist environment to maintain ischemic cells temporarily until a vascular supply is well-established
- Day 3-5: Inosculation
  - Graft and wound bed capillaries begin to align
  - Fine vascular network begins to form within the fibrin layer and the new capillary buds interface with the deep surface of dermis and allow for transfer of nutrients and oxygen
- Day 5 onwards: Revascularization
  - Graft revascularized by capillary regrowth
  - Process which new blood vessels either directly invade the graft or anastomose to open dermal vascular channels and restore the pink hue of skin
- 90% of maximal tensile strength achieved in 6 weeks

2. Split-thickness skin grafts
   ➡ Definition = Include epidermis and a portion of dermis
   ➡ Donor sites = Thigh/ Buttock/ Scalp

- Heals by secondary intention
- Use a moist occlusive dressing to reduce pain and facilitate healing
  ➡ Features of a split-thickness grafts are determined by amount of dermis present
- Thin split-thickness grafts
  - Less primary contraction (degree to which graft shrinks in surface area after harvesting and before grafting)
  - More secondary contraction (degree to which a graft shrinks during healing)
  - Poor durability
  - Poor cosmetic appearance (heal with abnormal pigmentation)
- Thick split-thickness grafts - More primary contraction (degree to which graft shrinks in surface area after harvesting and before grafting) - Less secondary contraction (degree to which a graft shrinks during healing)
  ➡ Split grafts can be meshed to expand surface area that can be covered which is particularly useful when large area must be resurfaced as in major burns
- Meshed grafts usually also have enhanced reliability of engraftment because the fenestration allow for egress of wound fluid and excellent contour matching of the wound bed by the grafts
- Ratio of 1:1.5 is commonly used
- Fenestrations in meshed grafts reepithelialise by secondary intention from the surrounding graft skin
- Disadvantages include more secondary contraction and poor cosmetic appearance
  1173

3. Full-thickness skin grafts
   ➡**Definition** = Include epidermis and dermis
   ➡ Donor sites = Groin/ Abdomen/ Post-auricular/ Supraclavicular

- Heals by primary closure or split-thickness grafting
  ➡Critical to remove subcutaneous tissue from the deep surface of dermis (_defat the graft_) to allow optimal graft take (engraftment)
  ➡Cutting slits in graft allow fluid egress and bolstering may reduce the risk of graft loss
  ➡Requires well-vascularized recipient beds without bacterial colonization, previous irradiation or atrophic wound tissues
  ➡Associated with the least secondary contraction upon healing, the best cosmetic appearance and the highest durability
- Frequently used in reconstructing superficial wound of the face and hands

4. Composite grafts
   ➡ **Definition** = Include epidermis and dermis + Additional tissues (subcutaneous fat/ cartilage/ muscles/ perichondrium)
   ➡Especially useful in select cases of nasal reconstruction

5. Other grafts sources
   ➡Fat grafts = Liposuction of abdomen/ thigh/ buttock
   ➡Tendon grafts = Palmaris longus/ Plantaris tendons
   ➡Cartilage grafts = Costal cartilage/ Concha of ear/ Nasal septum
   ➡Bone grafts

- Cortical bone = Ribs/ Outer table of cranium/ Fibula
- Cancellous bone = Iliac crest
  ➡Nerve grafts = Sural nerve/ Lateral or medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve

1174

### III. Skin flaps

1. Overview
   ➡Flap is a vascularized block of tissue that is mobilized from donor site and transferred to another
   adjacent or remote location for reconstructive purpose
   ➡Difference between graft and a flap

- Graft bring **NO** vascular pedicel and derives its blood flow from recipient site
  revascularization
- Flaps arrives with its blood supply intact

2. Classification based on blood supply
   ➡Random cutaneous flaps

- Random pattern flaps have a blood supply based on tiny blood vessels in the dermal-
  subdermal plexus - Length-to-width ratio of 3:1 is generally accepted but varies by anatomical
  location (face has a ratio up to 5:1) - Typically used to reconstruct relatively small full-thickness defects that are not
  amendable to skin grafting
- Transposition flaps = Rotates about a pivot point into adjacent defect - Rhomboid flap - Z-plasty flap = 2 Flaps are rotated each into the donor site of the other to achieve
  central limb lengthening
- Rotational flaps = Rotates about a pivot point but differs from transposition flap in that
  they are semicircular
- Advancement flaps = Advancement of skin directly into defect without rotation - Simple advancement flap - V-Y advancement flap - Bipedicle advancement flap
  ➡Axial cutaneous flaps
- Axial cutaneous flaps contain a single dominant arteriovenous system allowing for a
  potentially greater length-to-width ratio
- Peninsular flap = Skin and vessels are moved together as a unit
- Island flap = Skin is divided from surround tissue and maintained on an isolated intact
  vascular pedicle
- Free flaps = Vascular pedicle is isolated and divided

[Image Description: The number 1175 is present in the lower right corner of the page]

3. Fasciocutaneous and myocutaneous flaps
   => Composition of a flaps describes its tissue components

- Fasciocutaneous flap = Contains skin and fascia
  - Donor site = Radial forearm/ Lateral arm/ Anterolateral thigh/ Groin
- Myocutaneous flap = Contains muscles, overlying skin and intervening tissues
- Osteomyocutaneous flap = Contains vascularized bone, muscle, skin and subcutaneous tissue - Donor site = Fibular/ Scapular spine/ Iliac (with overlying IO muscle)/ Rib (with pectoralis major or intercostal muscle)
  => Contiguity of a flap describes its position related to its source
- Local flaps = Transferred from a position adjacent to the defect
- Regional flaps = From same anatomical region of the body as the defect
- Distant flap = From a different anatomical region to the defect - Pedicled flaps = Remains attached to the anatomical source region - Free flaps = Transferred by microsurgery
  => Concept of perforator
- Perforator flaps evolved from the observation that the muscle component of myocutaneous flaps served as a carrier of blood vessels to overlying fasciocutaneous tissue
- It had been deemed before that it is mandatory to include the muscle for reliable harvest of fasciocutaneous tissue supplied by musculocutaneous perforators even if it was not necessary to include that muscle for reconstruction leading to unnecessary muscular deficit at the donor site
  - Fasciocutaneous flaps that were supplied by musculocutaneous perforator were previously abandoned
- Introduction of intramuscular retrograde dissection techniques allow skeletonization of musculocutaneous perforator from its encasement within a muscle belly which spare the muscle from flap harvest
  => Conditioning
- Refers to any procedure that increase the reliability of a flap by enlarging the angiosome of the pedicle artery from its dynamic towards its potential angiosome
- Improves the survival of flaps that otherwise would more frequently be complicated by unpredictable partial necrosis
- Example - One method of delay for pedicle TRAM flap is to divide a major portion of its blood supply, the deep inferior epigastric artery on both sides before transfer - In response, blood from anatomical angiosome of the superior epigastric artery appears to flow into that of the interrupted deep inferior epigastric artery via intervening choke vessels - As a result, the flap becomes conditioned to rely on superior epigastric artery - TRAM flap can then be transferred based on superior epigastric artery with less risk of its distal portions becoming ischemic and possibly necrosis
  => Tissue expansion
- Creates the potential to increase the amount of local well-matched tissue that can be advanced or transposed as a flap while decreasing donor site morbidity
- Most common method of skin expansion involves the placement of an inflatable silicon elastomer balloon beneath the skin and subcutaneous tissue followed by serial inflation with saline
- After completion of expansion the redundant overlying skin may be advanced into an adjacent defect

Plastic surgery Diseases

Burns

I. Overview

1. General features
   ➡Burns results from thermal injury to the skin
   ➡ Compromise the skin's function as a barrier to injury and infection and as a regulator of body
   temperature and fluid loss

- Human skin can tolerate temperature up to 42 – 44°C and the resulting chances are mostly
  reversible
- Temperature > 45°C cause more severe tissue destruction and protein damage becomes
  permanent
  ➡Mortality from burns are bimodal occurring
- Immediately after the injury
- Weeks later from sepsis and multiorgan failure

2. Different types of burns
   ➡ Thermal

- Flame burns (dry heat)
  - Most common cause for hospital admission of burns
  - Highest mortality due to accompanying inhalation injury or CO poisoning)
- Scald burns (moist heat from water or oil)
- Contact burn
- Cold burn (frostbite/ frostnip)
- Smoke and inhalational - CO poisoning resulting from smoke inhalation is an important contributor to early
  mortality in burn patients - Affinity of CO for Hb is 200 – 250x higher than O2 which decreases the
  level of normal oxygenated Hb and can quickly lead to anoxia and death - Hydrogen cyanide toxicity is another component of smoke inhalation injury - Leads to persistent lactic acidosis or ST elevation on ECG - Hydrogen cyanide inhibits cytochrome oxidase which is required for
  oxidative phosphorylation
  ➡Electrical burns
- Low voltage/ High voltage burn
- Special concerns for potential cardiac arrhythmia and compartment syndromes associated
  with concurrent rhabdomyolysis
  ➡Chemical burns
- Acid burns = Coagulative necrosis
  - Eschar or necrotic tissues form a barrier
  - Example: NaOH/ Bleach/ Drain cleaner
- Alkali burns = Liquefactive necrosis - Damaged tissues melt and alkali penetrates to deeper tissues - Example: Hydrofluoric acid/ Formic acid/ Sulphuric acid - Formic acid cause hemolysis and hemoglobinuria - Hydrofluoric acid cause hypocalcemia and is common due to widespread
  industrial use
- Alkali burns are more severe than acid burns
  ➡ Friction

II. Pathophysiology

1. Jackson's Burn Wound Model
   [An illustration depicts Jackson's Burn Wound Model. The diagram consists of three concentric zones over a cross-section of skin layers labeled 'Epidermis' and 'Dermis'. The innermost zone is labeled 'Zone of Coagulation,' surrounded by the 'Zone of Stasis,' and the outermost zone is 'Zone of Hyperemia'. The zones are colored with varying shades of red, creating a visual representation of the burn severity.]
   ➡Zone of coagulation (~3rd or 4th degree burn)

- **MOST** severely burned portion and is typically in the centre of wound
- Area in a burn nearest the heat source that suffers the most damage as evidence by clotted blood and thrombosed blood vessels
- Affected tissue is coagulated and sometimes frankly necrosis
  ➡Zone of stasis (~2nd degree burn)
- Area surrounding zone of coagulation
- Variable degrees of vasoconstriction with decreased blood flow and resultant ischemia
- Appropriate resuscitation and wound care may help prevent conversion into a deeper wound but infection or suboptimal perfusion may result in an increase in burn depth
  ➡Zone of hyperaemia (~1st degree burn)
- Peripheral area around burns that has an increased blood flow
- Heal with minimal or no scarring

2. Physiological response to burns
   ➡Stage 1: Emergent phase

- Pain response
- Catecholamine release leading to hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea and anxiety
  ➡Stage 2: Fluid shift phase
- Lasts for 18 – 24 hours and peaks in 6 – 8 hours
- Damaged cells initiate inflammatory response
- Increase in blood flow to cells with shift of fluid from intravascular to extravascular space leading to massive edema
  ➡Stage 3: Hypermetabolic phase
- Lasts for days to weeks
- Large increase in body's need for nutrients as it self-repairs
  ➡Stage 4: Resolution phase
- Scar formation
- General rehabilitation and progression to normal function

1178

III. Assessment

1. Burn depth assessment

[Detailed diagram of the skin layer, showing epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous fat, muscle, hair follicle, and sweat gland. An arrow indicates burn depth, extending from superficial (1st degree) to deeper injury (4th degree). Each level is marked to show the depth of the burn.]

➡ Burn depth classification by Dupuytren (1832)

| Degree     | Description                   | Involvement                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st degree | Superficial                   | Epidermis                                           |
| 2nd degree | Superficial partial thickness | Superficial dermis                                  |
|            | Deep partial thickness        | Deep dermis                                         |
| 3rd degree | Full-thickness                | Entire dermis                                       |
| 4th degree | Deeper injury                 | Extends into underlying soft tissue, muscle or bone |

[Image of a burn on a torso. The burn is red and blistering, described as superficial (1st degree).]
[Image of a burn on a knee. The burn is red with some blistering, described as superficial partial thickness (2nd degree).]
[Image of a burn on an arm. The burn is red, wet and blistering, described as deep partial thickness (2nd degree).]
[Image of a burn on a leg. The burn is white and dry, described as full thickness (3rd degree).]

| Degree     | Description       | Color                                 | Blisters | Capillary refill | Sensation | Healing     |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 1st degree | Superficial       | Red (blanches)                        | No       | Present          | Painful   | Yes (3-6d)  |
| 2nd degree | Partial thickness | Superficial Pale pink (blanches)      | Present  | Present          | Painful   | Yes (7-21d) |
|            |                   | Mid Dark pink Blotchy red (no blanch) | Present  | Sluggish         | +         | Usually     |
|            | Deep              | +                                     | Absent   | Absent           | No (>21d) |

2. Burn wound assessment

[A diagram illustrating the rule of nines for burn assessment. A male figure is divided into sections representing percentages of total body surface area (TBSA). The head and neck are labeled as 9%, the anterior trunk as 18%, the posterior trunk as 18%, each arm as 9%, each leg as 18%, and the genitalia and perineum as 1%.]

[Two diagrams of human figures, one anterior and one posterior, with various body parts labeled with percentages, indicating relative body surface area by age. A table shows the relative percentage of body surface areas (% BSA) affected by growth for 0 yr, 1 yr, 5 yr, 10 yr, and 15 yr. The body parts include the head, thigh, and lower leg.]

Rule of nines

Lund-Browder chart

➡Estimation of burnt area in terms of % total body surface area (% TBSA)
➡Estimation with Lund-Browder chart

- Most accurate method for estimating % TBSA for both adults and children
- Children have proportionally larger heads and smaller lower extremities so % TBSA is more accurate with this method
  ➡Estimation with "Rules of 9"
- Estimate burn size by dividing the body into regions to which TBSA is allocated in multiples of 9
- Superficial or 1st degree burns should not be included when calculating % TBSA
- Easy to remember but is only accurate in adults
- Estimation in adults
  - Anterior and posterior trunk = 18%
  - Each lower extremity = 18%
  - Each upper extremity = 9%
  - Head = 9%
    ➡Estimation with palm method
- Palm including fingers = 1%; Palm excluding fingers = 0.5% in both adults and children
- Small or patchy burns can by approximated by using the surface area of patient's palm

3. Severity of burns

| Severity | Children/ Elderly                  | Adults                             |
| :------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Mild     | ⇨ < 10% TBSA                       | ⇨ <15% TBSA                        |

IV. Treatment

1. First-aid in burns management (applicable immediately after accident and primary survey while
   waiting for assistance within 3 hours post-burn)
   ➡Stop the burning process
   ➡Cool the burn wound

- Use tap water ~15°C (8°C - 25°C)
- Do **NOT** use ice or iced water
  - Vasoconstriction will further impede blood flow and impairs wound healing
  - Aim is to increase blood flow to avoid further tissue necrosis
- Flow, spray or sponging for **AT LEAST** 15 – 20 mins
  - Effective within first 3 hours post-burn (**NOT** effective after 3 hours)
  - Watch out for hypothermia when large body surface area is cooled
- Water gels or hydrogels may be useful
  ➡Limb elevation
- Reduces swelling
- Reduces circulatory impairment
- Improves tissue perfusion and nutrition

2. Primary survey (ABC is **more important** than the burn wound itself)
   ➡A =Airway

- Secure airway with C-spine control
- Open up airway (head tilt chin lift) and removal of foreign bodies and debris
- 100% O2 supplementation by mask
  - Indications for ventilation include desaturation (deteriorating oxygenation)
- Endotracheal intubation should be considered
  - Oral intubation is preferred
  - Nasotracheal intubation may be useful in patients with combined multiple trauma
    especially oral trauma
  - Indications for intubation
    - Reduced level of consciousness
    - Impending airway obstruction
    - Facilitate safe transport
- Cricothyroidotomy/ Tracheostomy
- Remarks - Direct thermal injury to upper airways or smoke inhalation can lead to rapid and
  severe airway edema which is potentially lethal - Perioral burns, singed nasal hairs, soot in mouth, swollen lips or tongue are signs
  that the oral cavity and pharynx should be further evaluated for mucosal injury - Signs of impending respiratory compromise include hoarseness, wheezing, stridor,
  dyspnea and drooling of saliva
  ➡ B = Breathing
- Confirm bilateral air entry by auscultation of breath sound
- Order CXR

1181

=> **C=Circulation**

- Fluid resuscitation indicated in the following situations
  - Adult: > 20% TBSA burns
  - Children: > 10% TBSA burns
  - Children has higher surface area to body weight ratio and signs of decompensation occur late but rapidly
- Access for IV fluid resuscitation
  - 2 Large bore peripheral IV catheter should be placed and fluid resuscitation should be initiated concurrently with primary survey
  - Central venous access may provide useful information as to volume status and useful in severely burned patients
  - Pediatric patients with burns > 15% may require intraosseous (IO) access in emergent situations if venous access cannot be attained
- Estimation of fluid needs by **Parkland formula\***
  - Volume calculated estimates the fluid required in the **first 24 hours from the time of injury** but **NOT** the time of presentation
  - Adult: 3 – 4 mL Crystalloid x Body weight (kg) x % Burn
  - Children: 3 – 4 mL Crystalloid x Body weight (kg) x % Burn + Maintenance fluid
    (maintenance required due to small reserve)
    - 100 mL/kg for first 10 kg
    - 50 mL/kg for next 10 kg
    - 20 mL/kg for each kg over 20 kg
- Rate of fluid resuscitation
  - Adult: ½ of volume given in first 8 hrs; Remaining ½ given in following 16 hrs
  - Children: Constant rate over 24 hours
- Remarks
  - Decreased intravascular volume due to fluid loss (loss of skin and evaporation) and shifts of fluid to interstitial space (3rd space loss) due to inflammation and increased vascular permeability resulting in hypovolemic shock

=> **D = Disability**

- Assess level of consciousness by AVPU scale
  - AVPU = Alert/ Voice/ Pain/ Unresponsive
- Assess pupil size

=> **E = Exposure and environmental control**

- Remove all clothing or jewellery if not done
- Prevent hypothermia by wrapping patient with clean dry sheet and warm blankets
- Monitoring of body temperature
- Identify associated injuries by secondary survey

1182

3. Management after initial 24 hours
   ➡ Change of dressings - **Standard dressing:** Bathing → Paraffin gauze → Gauze → Velband → Crepe bandage - **Specialized dressing:** Non-adherent dressing/ Dressing with antibacterial compounds (e.g. silver ions, hydrocolloid, hydrogels)
   ➡ Debridement - Debridement and skin graft are advised if wound is expected not to heal conservatively in 3 weeks especially in functionally or cosmetically sensitive areas - The longer the wound takes to heal, the worse the scar is - Different types of debridement - Auto-debridement: Patient's own healing mechanism - Chemical/ Enzymatic debridement: Peptidase/ Collagenase - Mechanical debridement: Scrubbing/ Change of dressing - Surgical debridement: Surgery
   ➡ Escharotomy and fasciotomy - Escharotomy - Divides eschar which can be performed at bedside - Limb escharotomy to maintain circulation into a limb with overlying rigid eschar - Chest escharotomy to allow chest expansion - Fasciotomy - Divides deep fascia usually for extremities which is performed in OT under GA - Release compartmental pressure and avoid ischemia to muscles and nerves

5. Management for other types of burns
   ➡Chemical burns

- Careful removal of toxic substance from patient and irrigation of affected area with water for a minimum of 30 mins
- Calcium-based treatment is the mainstay of treating hydrofluoric acid burns with topical application of calcium gluconate onto wounds and IV administration of calcium gluconate for systemic symptoms
  - IA infusion of calcium gluconate provides effective treatment of progressive tissue injury and intense pain
    ➡Smoke and inhalation injury
- Administration of 100% O2 is the gold standard for treatment of CO poisoning and reduces the half-life (t1/2) of CO from 250 mins in room air to 40-60 mins in 100% O2
- Treatment of hydrogen cyanide toxicity involves sodium thiosulfate, hydroxocobalamin and 100% O2
  - Hydroxocobalamin quickly complexes with cyanide and is excreted by the kidneys and is recommended for immediate therapy
  - Sodium thiosulfate works by transforming cyanide into non-toxic thiocyanate derivative but work slowly and is not effective for acute therapy
  - Lactic acidosis will resolve with ventilation in majority of patients making sodium thiosulfate treatment unnecessary
