## Management of CA Esophagus

### Guiding Principles — How to Think About Treatment

Before diving into modalities, internalise the framework that drives every management decision. There are **three factors** that determine treatment [1]:

1. ***Tumour factor*** — size, location (upper/mid/lower 1/3, cardia), ***presence of lymph node metastasis***, ***invasion into adjacent major organs (resectable vs unresectable)*** [1][2]
2. ***Patient factor*** — age, comorbidities, ***lung function (FEV1 > 1.5 L)***, ***exercise tolerance ( > 2 flights of stairs)***, smoking status, nutritional status [2]
3. ***Surgeon/organ factor*** — experience of surgeon, hospital equipment, ***method of reconstructing esophagus*** [2]

And there are **three treatment objectives** [1]:
- ***Local control = resection of tumour with negative (clear) resection margin***
- ***Regional control = lymph node dissection***
- ***Systemic control = NOT indicated for CA esophagus*** (i.e., there is no role for routine adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in isolation unlike, say, colon cancer — but neoadjuvant and definitive chemoradiation play major roles)

The fundamental decision is **curative vs palliative**:
- ***Early stage cancer should be offered curative treatment*** (surgery ± neoadjuvant, or radical chemoRT)
- ***Advanced stage cancer should be offered palliative care*** [1]

<Callout title="Key Principle">
***Surgery alone produces few cures in either squamous cell or adenocarcinoma except in the earliest stages of disease*** [1]. This is why multimodality treatment (neoadjuvant chemoRT + surgery) is the standard of care for locally advanced but resectable disease.
</Callout>

### Detailed Treatment Modalities

#### A. Endoscopic Therapy — EMR and ESD [1][2]

"Endoscopic" → from Greek *endo-* (within) + *skopein* (to look) — you're treating from inside the lumen.

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Principle** | Remove the superficial tumour through the endoscope, preserving the native esophagus |
| ***Indications*** | ***Superficial cancer limited to mucosa (T1a)*** but ***NOT for more advanced cancer since the chance of lymph node metastasis is too high*** [1]; patients who prefer esophageal preservation [1] |
| **Critical cut-off** | ***Tumour invasion into submucosa (T1b), even without visible LN involvement, should receive esophagectomy with LN dissection due to high frequency (20–25%) of concurrent findings of positive LNs*** [1] |
| ***Advantages*** | ***Esophageal preservation and reduced post-treatment mortality*** [1]; ***less invasive, safe, and highly effective (90% survival)*** [2] |
| ***Disadvantages*** | ***Technically demanding and lack of long-term outcomes and recurrence data*** [1] |

**EMR vs ESD:**

| | ***EMR*** | ***ESD*** |
|---|---|---|
| Technique | ***Snare resection*** after submucosal injection (hyaluronic acid + saline) to elevate the lesion [2] | ***Dissect lesions from the submucosa*** using an insulated-tip knife [1] |
| Size limit | ***Not effective for lesions > 2 cm*** — piecemeal resection is necessary → increased complications, impossible to conclusively assess completeness of lateral resection margin [1] | ***Can remove larger lesions intact*** (en-bloc) [1] |
| En-bloc rate | Lower | ***Higher en-bloc resection rate*** [2] |
| Complications | Lower | Higher (bleeding, perforation, stricture) |

<Callout title="T1a vs T1b — The Most Important Staging Decision">
This single distinction changes everything: **T1a → endoscopic therapy (organ-sparing)**; **T1b → major surgery (esophagectomy)**. Why? Because the submucosa contains the dense lymphatic plexus. Once tumour reaches the submucosa, the probability of lymph node metastasis jumps to 20–25%, making endoscopic therapy inadequate (it doesn't remove lymph nodes). This is why EUS is performed before deciding on endoscopic vs surgical treatment.
</Callout>

---

#### B. Esophagectomy with Reconstruction and LN Dissection [1][2]

This is the definitive curative surgery. It is a major operation with significant morbidity (30–50%) and mortality (2–5% in high-volume centres).

##### Surgical Approaches

| Approach | Technique | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Ivor-Lewis (2-stage, transthoracic)*** [1] | **Step 1**: Upper midline abdominal incision — mobilise stomach, divide left gastric artery and LNs, create gastric conduit. **Step 2**: ***Right thoracotomy (entry above 5th rib)*** — ***gives excellent access to mediastinum and thoracic inlet*** [1]; esophagectomy + ***intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis*** | Best for mid/lower thoracic tumours; allows direct vision thoracic lymphadenectomy; anastomosis is intrathoracic (risk: if it leaks → mediastinitis) |
| ***McKeown (3-stage, transthoracic)*** [1] | **Step 1**: Abdominal — same as Ivor-Lewis. **Step 2**: Right thoracotomy — esophagectomy. **Step 3**: ***Neck incision — cervical esophagogastric anastomosis*** | Best for upper thoracic tumours where you need a proximal resection margin in the neck; cervical anastomosis is safer if it leaks (drains externally rather than into mediastinum); ***but higher risk of anastomotic leak (10%) because gastric conduit has more tension and poorer blood supply*** [2] |
| ***Transhiatal (THE)*** [1][2] | ***Esophagectomy without a thoracotomy*** [1]; stomach mobilised via midline abdominal incision; diaphragm opened from abdomen; lower esophagus mobilised under direct vision; upper esophagus mobilised by ***blunt dissection***; cervical anastomosis via neck incision | ***Provides removal of tumour and LN in the lower mediastinum ONLY but not in upper or middle mediastinum*** [1]; ***unsuitable for SCC*** (usually needs full mediastinal lymphadenectomy); ***advantages: reduced risk of pneumonia, suitable for poor lung function*** [2]; rarely done now [2] |

**Why can the esophagus be mobilised by blunt dissection?** Because the ***esophagus has segmental blood supply by small vessels only*** [1] — these can be divided sequentially without catastrophic bleeding, unlike the aorta or major visceral arteries.

##### Key Surgical Principles

- ***Lymph node dissection is mandatory in all approaches*** [1]
- ***Resection margin should be generous since CA esophagus is NOTORIOUS for submucosal spread*** [1] — aim for ≥ 5 cm proximal and distal margins; intraoperative frozen section of margins is standard
- **Extent of lymphadenectomy** [2]:
  - ***10 cm proximal and 5 cm distal to macroscopic tumour***
  - ***2-field dissection: Field 1 (cervical) and Field 2 (mediastinal) for upper 1/3 tumours; Field 2 (mediastinal) and Field 3 (abdominal/celiac) for lower 1/3 tumours*** [2]

**Fields of LN dissection** [2]:
1. ***Field 1: Cervical LN***
2. ***Field 2: Mediastinal LN***
3. ***Field 3: Intra-abdominal (celiac) LN***

##### Reconstruction — The Gastric Conduit [2]

After removing the esophagus, you need to reconstruct the alimentary tract. The stomach is the preferred conduit:

- ***Gastric mobilisation*** [2]: ***ligate left-sided blood supply (short gastric artery, left gastric artery, left gastroepiploic artery)*** — the conduit survives on the **right gastroepiploic artery** and **right gastric artery**
- ***Route***: bring gastric conduit up via ***native tract of esophagus*** (lowest tension, best blood supply) or ***retrosternal / subcutaneous*** routes if re-operating [2]
- ***Pyloroplasty***: ***improve gastric emptying post-op*** [2] — the vagus nerves are inevitably transected during esophagectomy → vagal denervation → gastric stasis; pyloroplasty bypasses this
- ***Insert feeding jejunostomy tube*** [2] — post-operative nutrition while the anastomosis heals
- **Alternative conduit**: ***colonic interposition*** (e.g., previous gastrectomy, post-leakage) — ***needs bowel prep and antibiotics*** [2]

##### Other Rare Approaches [2]

- ***Thoraco-abdominal approach***: for very distal tumours; limited by arch of aorta
- ***Pharyngo-laryngo-oesophagectomy (PLO)***: for very proximal tumours; ***requires permanent tracheostomy and voice rehabilitation → primary chemoRT is preferred now*** [2]

##### Choice of Surgery by Tumour Location and Siewert Type [1]

| Tumour Location | Preferred Approach | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Upper 1/3 | McKeown (3-stage) or primary chemoRT | Need proximal margin in the neck; PLO reserved for selected cases |
| Middle 1/3 | McKeown or Ivor-Lewis | Both allow adequate mediastinal access |
| Lower 1/3 / ***Siewert Type I*** | ***Transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy + partial gastrectomy + 2-field lymphadenectomy*** [1] | Distal ADC arising from Barrett's |
| ***Siewert Type II*** | ***Transabdominal/transhiatal resection of distal esophagus + total gastrectomy + lymphadenectomy of lower mediastinum and abdominal D2 nodal compartment*** [1] | True cardia cancer |
| ***Siewert Type III*** | ***Same as Type II*** [1] | Subcardial gastric cancer infiltrating upward |

##### Prevention of Surgical Complications [1]

| Phase | Measures |
|---|---|
| ***Pre-operative*** | ***Encourage respiratory muscle exercise; smoking cessation*** [1] |
| ***Intraoperative*** | ***Prevent prolonged operation*** (→ atelectasis from mucus accumulation); ***prevent infusion of large amount of fluid*** (→ pulmonary oedema) [1] |
| ***Post-operative*** | ***Encourage respiratory muscle exercise (deep breathing exercise); encourage coughing*** (→ prevent sputum retention); ***chest physiotherapy; pain control*** (***PCA, thoracic epidural analgesia***); ***early mobilisation*** [1] |

---

#### C. Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy [1][2]

##### Neoadjuvant ChemoRT — The CROSS Protocol [2]

This is the landmark trial that established the current standard of care for locally advanced esophageal cancer:

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| ***Indication*** | ***Locally advanced SCC — T2N1, T3N0, T3N1*** [2]; also used for locally advanced ADC |
| ***Regimen*** | ***5-fluorouracil + cisplatin + 40 Gy RT*** [2] |
| ***Schedule*** | ***6–8 weeks for 2 courses → wait 4 weeks and repeat PET-CT + OGD → wait 4 weeks for surgery*** [2] |
| **Rationale** | ***Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: (1) downstage and shrink the tumour to increase chance of operability; (2) eradicate occult or silent micrometastasis next to primary tumour*** — based on the observation that ***most patients develop postoperative systemic metastasis without local recurrences*** [1] |
| ***Side effects*** | ***RT-induced fibrosis, worsened dysphagia*** [2] |

**Why "neoadjuvant" (before surgery) rather than "adjuvant" (after surgery)?**
- Post-operatively, the patient is recovering from a massive operation → may not tolerate chemotherapy
- The tumour has its own blood supply intact pre-operatively → chemotherapy drugs reach the tumour more effectively
- Neoadjuvant treatment can shrink the tumour → making surgery technically easier with better resection margins
- The pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy provides prognostic information (complete pathological response = excellent prognosis)

##### Adjuvant ChemoRadiation [1]

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Rationale** | ***Eradicate residual tumour at resection margin; decreases risk of local recurrence*** [1] |
| **When** | Considered if positive margins (R1 resection), node-positive disease, or poor prognostic features on final pathology |

##### Definitive (Radical) ChemoRT — Without Surgery [1][2]

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| ***Indication*** | ***Inoperable SCC; patients not fit for surgery (e.g., poor lung function)*** [2] |
| **Key point** | ***Radical radiotherapy is ALSO curative*** [1] — this is important to remember. For SCC especially, definitive chemoRT can achieve cure rates approaching surgery in selected patients |
| ***Regimen*** | ***Cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil + > 50 Gy RT*** [2] |
| **SCC vs ADC** | ***SCC is more sensitive to chemoRT*** [2]; ***ADC is less sensitive to chemoRT → surgery is preferred*** [2] |

<Callout title="SCC vs ADC — Treatment Sensitivity Difference">
***SCC is more sensitive to chemoRT; ADC is less sensitive to chemoRT → surgery is preferred for ADC*** [2]. This is a key exam point. The biological basis: SCC cells have higher proliferative rates and are more susceptible to radiation-induced DNA damage. ADC cells tend to be more radiation-resistant, so surgical resection remains the backbone of ADC management.
</Callout>

##### Targeted Therapy and Immunotherapy (Current Practice, 2024–2026)

These are increasingly important, especially for advanced/metastatic disease:

| Agent | Target | Indication |
|---|---|---|
| **Trastuzumab** (Herceptin) | HER2 receptor | HER2-positive ADC (overexpressed in ~20% of esophageal/EGJ ADC); added to first-line chemotherapy |
| **Ramucirumab** | VEGFR-2 | Second-line for advanced ADC; anti-angiogenic |
| **Nivolumab / Pembrolizumab** | PD-1 | PD-L1-positive or MSI-high tumours; now part of first-line treatment (CheckMate 649, KEYNOTE-590 trials); also adjuvant nivolumab post-neoadjuvant chemoRT + surgery (CheckMate 577) |

> In the current era (2025–2026), **adjuvant nivolumab** for 1 year post-esophagectomy after neoadjuvant chemoRT in patients who did NOT achieve complete pathological response is standard of care per the **CheckMate 577 trial** — this significantly improves disease-free survival.

---

#### D. Palliative Treatment [1][2]

***Indications*** [1]:
- ***Patients with metastatic cancer (M1)***
- ***Cancers invading adjacent organs that are unresectable (T4b)***

The goals are to relieve dysphagia, maintain nutrition, control symptoms, and improve quality of life.

| Modality | Detail | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| ***Esophageal dilation + stenting*** [1][2] | ***Self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) with silicone coating*** placed endoscopically to palliate significant dysphagia [2] | ***NOT suitable for tumours long in size*** (poor functional peristalsis) ***or located in the cervical esophagus*** (discomfort) [1]; complications: ***perforation, erosion, obstruction of tube, or migration of stent*** [1]; ***unable to give RT after stenting*** [2] |
| ***Endoluminal ablation*** [1][2] | ***Laser ablation, argon plasma coagulation (APC)*** — ***restore esophageal lumen successfully 90% of the time with only a 4–5% perforation rate*** [1]; also used to ***open lumen / unblock stent*** [2] | |
| ***Radiotherapy*** [1][2] | ***External beam RT or brachytherapy (intraluminal RT)*** [2]; ***SCC is usually radiosensitive whereas ADC is less responsive*** [1] | ***First choice for palliation of EGJ cancers*** since ***stents placed across the EGJ are associated with higher chance of gastroesophageal reflux*** [1] |
| ***Chemotherapy*** [1] | ***Current regimens include cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)*** [1]; palliative chemoRT for symptom control | |
| ***Nutritional support*** [1][2] | ***PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), jejunostomy tube (PEJ), NG tube, open gastrostomy*** [1][2] | Essential for maintaining caloric intake when the esophagus is completely obstructed |
| **Best supportive care** | Pain management, anti-emetics, psychosocial support | For patients with very advanced disease or poor performance status |

<Callout title="Why NOT Stent Across the EGJ?" type="idea">
***Stents placed across the EGJ are associated with higher chance of gastroesophageal reflux*** [1]. This makes sense: the stent holds the EGJ permanently open, abolishing the physiological sphincter mechanism. The patient then suffers intractable reflux on top of their cancer. For EGJ tumours, **palliative RT** (especially brachytherapy) is preferred because it shrinks the tumour without permanently propping the sphincter open.
</Callout>

---

#### E. Management of Barrett's Esophagus (Pre-malignant Condition) [1][2]

Since Barrett's is the precursor lesion for ADC, its management is essentially **cancer prevention**:

- ***ALL patients with Barrett's esophagus should receive PPI whether they are symptomatic or not*** [1]
- ***Non-dysplasia***: endoscopic surveillance every ***3–5 years*** [1][2]
- ***Low-grade dysplasia***: ***endoscopic surveillance every 6 months for one year then annually if negative*** [1]; OR ***EMR + endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to ablate remaining metaplastic epithelium*** [1]
- ***High-grade dysplasia***: ***EMR + RFA*** [1]; or ***esophagectomy*** — ***only therapy that removes all neoplastic epithelium along with any occult malignancy and regional LNs*** but ***associated with high procedure-related morbidity and mortality*** [1]

---

### Complications of Esophagectomy [2]

Understanding complications is essential because they are commonly tested and because anticipating them guides peri-operative management.

#### Early Complications

| Complication | Incidence | Mechanism / Detail | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Post-op pneumonia*** | ***20%*** | ***Due to smoker status, thoracotomy, one-lung ventilation, vocal cord palsy*** [2] | Antibiotics, chest physiotherapy, incentive spirometry |
| **Reactionary bleeding** | Uncommon | ***Transection of azygos vein / aortic branches to esophagus*** [2] | Surgical re-exploration |
| ***Anastomotic leak*** | ***10%*** | ***Risk factors: poor blood supply of esophagus, tension of conduit, absence of serosa, use of neoadjuvant RT, surgeon technique*** [2] | ***NPO, IV fluids, TPN, antibiotics, monitor drain output; conservative: lay open for drainage (three-stage only); endoscopic: stenting, EndoSponge*** [2] |
| ***Conduit ischaemia*** | | ***Suspect if sepsis or metabolic acidosis within first 24 hours*** [2]; ***prevention: intraoperative ICG*** (indocyanine green fluorescence to assess conduit perfusion) [2] | ***Conservative if mild (Types 1/2); take down anastomosis if severe (Type 3): cervical esophagostomy + resection of ischaemic conduit*** [2] |
| ***RLN injury*** | ***20%*** | ***During LN dissection*** [2] — the recurrent laryngeal nerve runs in the tracheoesophageal groove and is at risk during mediastinal lymphadenectomy | Speech therapy; if bilateral → may need tracheostomy |
| ***Vagus nerve injury*** | Virtually universal | Vagotomy during esophagectomy → ***delayed gastric emptying*** [2] | ***Routine pyloroplasty*** [2]; prokinetics (metoclopramide, erythromycin) |
| ***Thoracic duct injury → chylothorax*** | | ***Diagnosis: increased drain output (milky appearance), TG > 110 or chylomicrons in pleural fluid*** [2] | ***Monitor: clinical (SOB), CXR, drain output; diet: NPO + TPN; octreotide; re-operation (suture ligation of thoracic duct stump) if output > 1 L/day*** [2] |
| **Atelectasis** | Common | One-lung ventilation during surgery; pain → splinting → poor cough [2] | Chest physiotherapy, incentive spirometry, early mobilisation |

#### Late Complications [2]

| Complication | Detail |
|---|---|
| ***Anastomotic stricture*** | ***Requires endoscopic dilation*** [2]; can be recurrent |
| ***Post-op GERD*** | ***PPI, motility agents*** [2]; the gastric conduit has no sphincter mechanism |
| ***Biliary reflux*** | Bile refluxes into the neo-esophagus; difficult to manage |
| ***Delayed gastric emptying*** | Despite pyloroplasty; prokinetics |
| **Dumping syndrome** | Rapid gastric emptying after vagotomy; early (osmotic) and late (reactive hypoglycaemia) |
| **Nutritional deficiencies** | Weight loss (nearly universal), iron deficiency, B12 deficiency |

---

### Contraindications to Curative Surgery

| Absolute Contraindications | Relative Contraindications |
|---|---|
| ***M1 disease (distant metastasis)*** | Poor nutritional status (albumin < 30, > 10% weight loss) |
| ***T4b (unresectable invasion: aorta, trachea, vertebral body)*** [2] | Advanced age with significant comorbidities |
| Positive peritoneal cytology | ***FEV1 < 1.25 L*** (relative — can consider THE approach) [1] |
| Poor performance status (ECOG ≥ 3) | Severe cardiac disease |
| Patient refusal | |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Management">

1. **T1a (mucosal)** → EMR/ESD (endoscopic therapy); organ-preserving; 90% survival.
2. **T1b (submucosal)** → Esophagectomy + LN dissection (20–25% LN metastasis even without visible LN involvement).
3. **Locally advanced, resectable (T2–3, N0–N+, M0)** → Neoadjuvant chemoRT (CROSS: 5-FU + cisplatin + 40 Gy) → esophagectomy.
4. **Inoperable / unfit** → Definitive chemoRT (radical RT is also curative, especially for SCC).
5. **SCC is more sensitive to chemoRT; ADC is less sensitive → surgery is the backbone for ADC.**
6. **Stage IV (M1) / T4b** → Palliative: stenting, endoluminal ablation, RT/brachytherapy, chemotherapy, nutritional support (PEG/jejunostomy).
7. **Esophagectomy approaches**: Ivor-Lewis (2-stage, intrathoracic anastomosis), McKeown (3-stage, cervical anastomosis), Transhiatal (no thoracotomy, limited LN dissection).
8. **LN dissection is mandatory in ALL approaches**; resection margin generous due to submucosal spread.
9. **Gastric conduit** — survives on right gastroepiploic artery; routine pyloroplasty for vagal denervation; feeding jejunostomy.
10. **Major complications**: pneumonia (20%), anastomotic leak (10%), RLN injury (20%), chylothorax, conduit ischaemia.
11. **Barrett's management**: PPI for all; surveillance stratified by dysplasia grade; EMR + RFA for dysplastic Barrett's.
12. **Adjuvant nivolumab** (CheckMate 577) — for patients without complete pathological response after neoadjuvant chemoRT + surgery.

For EGJ tumours, palliative RT (especially brachytherapy) is preferred.",
