## Complications of Cholangiocarcinoma

Complications of cholangiocarcinoma can be organized into three broad categories: **(A) complications of the disease itself** (i.e., what the tumour does to the patient), **(B) complications of the biliary obstruction** it causes (the pathophysiological cascade), and **(C) complications of treatment** (surgical and procedural). Understanding each from first principles means linking every complication back to a mechanism.

---

## A. Complications of the Disease Process

### 1. Biliary Sepsis (Ascending Cholangitis)

***Cause of mortality in MBO: Biliary sepsis*** [22][23]

**Pathophysiology:**
CCA obstructs the bile duct → bile stasis → bacterial colonisation of stagnant bile (normally, bile is kept sterile by constant antegrade flow and the sphincter of Oddi acting as a valve against duodenal reflux). Once bile is stagnant:

***Biliary obstruction + infection → Normal ductal pressure: 7–14 cm H₂O → Increased biliary pressure > 25 cm H₂O → Bacteria reflux to hepatic veins and lymphatics → Bacteraemia and septic shock*** [24]

***Excretion of antibiotics is impaired in biliary obstruction*** [24] — this is why antibiotics alone are often insufficient; biliary drainage is mandatory.

**Common organisms:** Gram-negative rods (E. coli, Klebsiella) > Enterococcus > Pseudomonas (especially if stent in situ) [19]

**Clinical presentation:**
- Charcot's triad (fever + jaundice + RUQ pain) → 50–70% of cholangitis cases
- Reynolds pentad (+ shock + confusion) → < 10%, indicates suppurative cholangitis with septic shock

**Why is cholangitis so dangerous in CCA patients?** Because these patients have:
- Already impaired hepatic immune function from biliary obstruction (see below)
- Often pre-existing malnutrition from cancer cachexia
- A permanent nidus of infection (the obstructed, stagnant bile cannot be sterilised without drainage)
- If a palliative stent is in place → the ***biliary stent in-situ serves as a foreign body nidus for infection*** [19]

<Callout title="Cholangitis in CCA is Recurrent">
Unlike gallstone cholangitis where the stone may pass spontaneously, CCA-related cholangitis tends to be recurrent because the obstruction is permanent (tumour grows relentlessly). This means patients on palliative stents will need repeated stent exchanges as stents occlude.
</Callout>

### 2. Liver Failure

***Cause of mortality in MBO: Liver failure*** [22][23]

**Pathophysiology — the cascade of hepatic decompensation:**

***Pathophysiological effects of malignant biliary obstruction:*** [25]
- ***Impaired protein synthesis*** → hypoalbuminaemia → oedema, ascites, poor wound healing
- ***Impaired clotting factor synthesis*** → coagulopathy → bleeding tendency
- ***Impaired gluconeogenesis*** → hypoglycaemia (especially in the fasted state)
- ***Impaired ketogenesis*** → cannot switch to fat as fuel during starvation → accelerated malnutrition
- ***Endotoxaemia*** → gut-derived endotoxins normally cleared by Kupffer cells in the liver; when biliary obstruction impairs Kupffer cell function → endotoxins enter the systemic circulation → SIRS, organ dysfunction
- ***↓ Reticuloendothelial function*** → impaired clearance of bacteria and toxins → increased susceptibility to infection
- ***↓ Cell-mediated immunity*** → impaired T-cell function → further susceptibility to sepsis

**Why does biliary obstruction impair liver function?**
Bile duct obstruction → back-pressure of bile → cholestasis → bile acids accumulate in hepatocytes → bile acid toxicity damages hepatocyte mitochondria and cell membranes → hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis → progressive loss of functional liver mass. Simultaneously, periductal inflammation and fibrosis from the tumour itself further destroys liver parenchyma.

***Why is malignant biliary obstruction so risky for operation?*** [23]
- ***Cancer cachexia → malnutrition***
- ***Liver function impairment***
- ***Superimposed biliary infection***

> These three factors combine to create a "perfect storm" of operative risk: a malnourished patient with a failing liver, impaired immunity, and active or potential infection. This is why **pre-operative optimisation** (biliary drainage, nutritional support, treating sepsis) is so critical.

### 3. Cancer Cachexia and Malnutrition

***Cause of mortality in MBO: Cancer cachexia*** [22][23]

**Pathophysiology:**
CCA causes cachexia through **two synergistic mechanisms:**

1. **Tumour-mediated cachexia:** Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α/"cachectin", IL-6, IL-1β) secreted by the tumour and host immune cells → increased basal metabolic rate + skeletal muscle proteolysis + lipolysis + anorexia via hypothalamic appetite suppression
2. **Bile salt malabsorption:** No bile salts in the duodenum → impaired fat emulsification → fat malabsorption → steatorrhoea → loss of calories and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)
   - **Vitamin K deficiency** → impaired synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, X → bleeding tendency (prolonged PT/INR) [16]
   - **Vitamin D deficiency** → osteomalacia, hypocalcaemia
   - **Vitamin A deficiency** → night blindness (rare, requires prolonged obstruction)

### 4. Obstructive Jaundice and Its Sequelae

Progressive biliary obstruction is the hallmark of extrahepatic CCA. Beyond just turning the patient yellow, obstructive jaundice has wide-ranging systemic effects:

| System | Complication | Mechanism |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Renal** | Hepatorenal syndrome / Acute kidney injury | Conjugated bilirubin and bile salts are directly nephrotoxic. Endotoxaemia causes renal vasoconstriction. Post-operative renal failure is a feared complication after surgery for MBO |
| **Cardiovascular** | Bradycardia, hypotension | Bile salts have direct negative chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium. Obstructive jaundice sensitises the heart to vagal stimulation |
| **Coagulation** | Bleeding tendency | Vitamin K malabsorption → reduced factors II, VII, IX, X. Also, biliary obstruction impairs hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors directly |
| **Immune** | Immunosuppression | ***↓ Reticuloendothelial function + ↓ Cell-mediated immunity*** [25] → increased susceptibility to wound infection, pneumonia, and sepsis |
| **Wound healing** | Poor healing / anastomotic leak | ***Impaired protein synthesis*** [25] → inadequate collagen formation. Also, impaired immune function increases wound infection risk |
| **GI** | Gastric stress ulceration | Endotoxaemia → mucosal ischaemia → stress ulcers (Curling-like ulcers) |

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl: Bleeding in Obstructive Jaundice" type="error">
A classic exam scenario: a patient with obstructive jaundice undergoes ERCP or biopsy and bleeds excessively. The cause is Vitamin K deficiency from fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption. ALWAYS check PT/INR and give IV Vitamin K (10 mg IV for 3 days) before any invasive procedure in a jaundiced patient. If urgent, give FFP.
</Callout>

### 5. Metastatic Complications

CCA spreads via several routes, each causing specific complications:

| Route | Metastatic Site | Complications |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| **Direct invasion** | Adjacent liver parenchyma, hepatoduodenal ligament, portal vein, hepatic artery | Progressive liver failure, portal hypertension, haemobilia |
| **Lymphatic** | Periportal, coeliac, para-aortic LN | Extrinsic compression of adjacent structures, chylous ascites |
| **Haematogenous** | ***Intrahepatic: Peritoneum / Lung / Pleura; Perihilar: Liver / Peritoneum / Lung / Brain / Bone; Distal: Liver / Peritoneum / Lung*** [2] | Peritoneal carcinomatosis → malignant ascites; Lung mets → dyspnoea, cough; Bone mets → pathological fractures, bone pain; Brain mets → neurological deficits |
| **Perineural** | Along nerves in the hepatoduodenal ligament | Intractable pain (visceral pain from coeliac plexus involvement); this is the mechanism behind the severe epigastric/back pain seen in advanced disease |
| **Peritoneal seeding** | Peritoneum | Malignant ascites, bowel obstruction |

### 6. Portal Hypertension

CCA can cause portal hypertension through:
- **Direct portal vein invasion** — the most common mechanism in perihilar CCA; tumour encases or occludes the main portal vein or its branches
- **Secondary biliary cirrhosis** — prolonged biliary obstruction → chronic cholestasis → periportal fibrosis → cirrhosis → portal hypertension [22]
- Consequences of portal hypertension: ascites, splenomegaly, oesophageal/gastric varices → upper GI bleeding

### 7. Gastric Outlet / Duodenal Obstruction

- Locally advanced distal CCA or pancreatic head invasion can compress the duodenum
- Presents with vomiting, early satiety, inability to tolerate oral intake
- Management: endoscopic duodenal stenting or gastrojejunostomy (double bypass) [16]

### 8. Haemobilia

***Haemobilia (UGIB from biliary tree)*** [4]

**Pathophysiology:** Tumour erodes into a branch of the hepatic artery or portal vein within the bile duct wall → blood enters the biliary tree → passes through the ampulla into the duodenum → presents as melaena or haematemesis. Classic triad of haemobilia = **jaundice + biliary colic + GI bleeding** (Quincke's triad).

Can also occur iatrogenically from:
- PTC/PTBD (needle punctures hepatic artery or portal vein in the portal triad) [16]
- Post-surgical bleeding from hepatic resection surface draining into the biliary tree

## B. Complications of Treatment

### 1. Complications of Biliary Stenting (ERCP/PTBD)

***Complications:*** [4][16]
- ***Stent occlusion (sludge / tumour ingrowth / tumour overgrowth)*** [16]
  - **Why does this happen?** Uncovered metallic stents have open mesh → tumour grows through the mesh interstices (ingrowth) or extends beyond the stent ends (overgrowth). Biliary sludge (a mixture of bacteria, calcium bilirubinate, and proteinaceous debris) also deposits on stent surfaces.
  - ***Management: sweeping or placing new stent*** [4]
  - Stent occlusion typically presents with recurrent jaundice ± cholangitis weeks to months after stent placement
- ***Stent migration*** [4][16]
  - More common with plastic stents; can migrate proximally (into the liver) or distally (into the duodenum)
- ***Cholangitis / Cholecystitis*** [16]
  - Stent insertion disrupts the normal barrier at the ampulla → bacterial contamination of the biliary tree → ascending cholangitis
  - Stents that occlude the cystic duct opening can cause acute cholecystitis
- **Pancreatitis** — ERCP manipulation at the ampulla can cause papillary oedema → pancreatic duct obstruction → post-ERCP pancreatitis (occurs in ~3–10% of ERCP procedures)
- **Perforation** — rare but life-threatening; duodenal perforation from endoscope or sphincterotomy
- **Bleeding** — from sphincterotomy site, or hepatic artery/portal vein injury during PTBD

***Pre-op biliary drainage has increased risk of serious complications:*** [26]
***Pancreatitis (7%), cholangitis (26%), blocked stent (15%), bleeding (2%), perforation (2%)*** [26]

**Specific PTBD complications:**
- ***Bleeding is common due to puncture of hepatic artery or portal vein before reaching the bile duct (Portal triad)*** [16]
- ***Hemobilia (communication of the tract with a major vascular structure)*** [16]
- Fluid and electrolyte loss from external bile drainage (bile contains ~600–1000 mL/day of fluid rich in sodium, bicarbonate, and chloride)
- Catheter dislodgement → bile peritonitis

### 2. Complications of Curative Surgery

#### General Surgical Complications (Post-hepatectomy / Post-Whipple)

**Early complications:**

| Complication | Mechanism | Specific to CCA Surgery? |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Post-operative liver failure** | Insufficient FLR after major hepatectomy; compounded by pre-existing cholestasis and malnutrition | Yes — this is THE feared complication of perihilar CCA surgery. Even with PVE to hypertrophy the FLR, cholestatic liver regenerates poorly |
| **Haemorrhage** | Major hepatic resection involves transaction of hepatic parenchyma with risk of injury to hepatic veins, portal vein branches, or hepatic artery | Yes — the hilar dissection for Klatskin tumour is extremely close to major vessels |
| **Bile leak / biliary fistula** | Leakage from the hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis or from the cut liver surface | Yes — the Roux-en-Y HJ is the most vulnerable anastomosis. The bile duct stumps after hilar resection are tiny and inflamed, making a watertight anastomosis challenging |
| **Intra-abdominal abscess** | Bile leak + haematoma → secondary infection | Common post-hepatectomy |
| **Wound infection** | ***Impaired immunity + poor nutrition + obstructive jaundice*** [25] | Higher risk in MBO patients |
| **Sepsis / organ failure** | Combination of surgical stress, impaired immunity, potential biliary contamination | Higher risk than non-MBO surgery |

**Complications specific to Whipple procedure (distal CCA):** [16]

| Complication | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| ***Delayed gastric emptying*** | ***Common***. Loss of normal duodenal pacemaker (interstitial cells of Cajal) and vagal nerve disruption → gastroparesis. More common in PPPD than classic Whipple |
| ***Pancreatic fistula*** | ***Common***. Leakage from pancreaticojejunostomy — the most feared Whipple complication. Risk factors: soft pancreas texture, small pancreatic duct, high BMI. Graded by ISGPF (biochemical leak → Grade B → Grade C) |
| ***Pancreatic anastomotic leak*** | Can lead to intra-abdominal abscess, erosion into adjacent vessels → pseudoaneurysm → massive haemorrhage (typically GDA stump bleed) |
| ***Biliary anastomotic breakdown*** | Leakage from the hepaticojejunostomy → bile peritonitis |
| **Marginal ulceration** | Post-gastrectomy ulceration at the gastrojejunostomy site (less common in PPPD) |

**Late complications of Whipple procedure:**

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| ***Exocrine insufficiency → malabsorption and steatorrhoea*** | Loss of pancreatic acinar tissue → decreased lipase, amylase, trypsin secretion → fat and protein maldigestion. Requires lifelong pancreatic enzyme replacement (Creon) |
| ***Endocrine insufficiency → diabetes mellitus*** | Loss of islet cell mass → insulin deficiency → new-onset diabetes. Termed "pancreatogenic diabetes" (Type 3c DM) |
| ***Gastric stasis*** | ***For patients undergoing pylorus-preserving Whipple's operation*** [16]. Chronic gastroparesis from vagal disruption |

**Late complications specific to hepaticojejunostomy:**
- ***Most frequent long-term complication of Roux-en-Y hepatojejunostomy is stenosis of biliary-enteric anastomosis leading to jaundice, cirrhosis or cholangitis*** [22]
  - **Why does anastomotic stricture occur?** Chronic inflammation, ischaemia of the anastomotic site, and scar contracture → progressive narrowing → recurrent cholestasis and cholangitis
  - Management: percutaneous balloon dilatation (PTC access), or surgical revision

### 3. Complications of Chemotherapy

Common adverse effects of the regimens used in CCA:

| Regimen | Key Toxicities | Mechanism |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Gemcitabine** | Myelosuppression (neutropaenia, thrombocytopaenia), flu-like symptoms, hepatotoxicity | Nucleoside analogue → inhibits DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells (including bone marrow) |
| **Cisplatin** | Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea/vomiting, peripheral neuropathy | Platinum cross-links DNA → damages renal tubular cells, cochlear hair cells, and peripheral nerves. Requires aggressive hydration |
| **Capecitabine** | Hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia), diarrhoea, mucositis | Converted to 5-FU in tissues → inhibits thymidylate synthase → mucosal toxicity |
| **Durvalumab** | Immune-related adverse events: pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, thyroiditis, dermatitis | Anti-PD-L1 → removes immune "brakes" → autoimmune-like inflammation in various organs |

---

## C. Disease Recurrence

Even after R0 resection, CCA has a high recurrence rate:
- **Overall recurrence rate:** 50–70% within 2 years
- **Sites of recurrence:** Local (anastomotic/perihilar), intrahepatic (distant liver metastases), peritoneal, distant (lung, bone)
- **Surveillance:** Serial CA 19-9, CT/MRI every 3–6 months for the first 2 years, then annually
- **Predictors of recurrence:** R1 margin, lymph node positivity, perineural invasion, poorly differentiated histology, high pre-operative CA 19-9, vascular invasion

## D. Summary: Causes of Mortality in MBO

***Cause of mortality in MBO:*** [22]
- ***Biliary sepsis*** — the single most common cause of death
- ***Liver failure*** — progressive hepatic decompensation from obstruction and tumour invasion
- ***Cancer cachexia*** — wasting from tumour-mediated metabolic derangement and malabsorption

These three causes form a vicious cycle: sepsis worsens liver function → liver failure worsens immune function → worsened immunity promotes more sepsis → all of this accelerates cachexia.

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Three causes of mortality in MBO (must know):** Biliary sepsis, Liver failure, Cancer cachexia.

**Pathophysiological effects of MBO:**
- Impaired protein synthesis, clotting factor synthesis, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis
- Endotoxaemia, decreased reticuloendothelial function, decreased cell-mediated immunity
- Vitamin K deficiency → coagulopathy; Vitamin D deficiency → osteomalacia

**Key disease complications:**
- Ascending cholangitis (recurrent; biliary pressure > 25 cmH₂O → bacteraemia)
- Progressive liver failure (bile acid toxicity to hepatocytes)
- Metastasis: perineural invasion (hallmark), peritoneal seeding, haematogenous to lung/bone/brain
- Portal hypertension (PV invasion or secondary biliary cirrhosis)
- Haemobilia (tumour erosion into hepatic artery/PV)

**Key treatment complications:**
- Stenting: occlusion (tumour ingrowth/sludge), migration, cholangitis, post-ERCP pancreatitis
- PTBD: bleeding (portal triad puncture), haemobilia, fluid/electrolyte loss
- Post-hepatectomy: liver failure (THE feared complication), bile leak, haemorrhage
- Post-Whipple: pancreatic fistula (most feared), delayed gastric emptying, exocrine/endocrine insufficiency
- HJ stricture: most common long-term complication → recurrent cholangitis/jaundice

**Pre-op biliary drainage itself increases complications** (pancreatitis 7%, cholangitis 26%, blocked stent 15%) but is necessary when surgery is delayed.
