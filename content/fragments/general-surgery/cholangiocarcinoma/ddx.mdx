## Differential Diagnosis of Cholangiocarcinoma

The differential diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma depends entirely on **how the patient presents**. Think about it from first principles: a patient walks into your clinic — what do they look like? There are essentially **two main clinical scenarios:**

1. **Obstructive jaundice** (extrahepatic CCA — perihilar or distal)
2. **Liver mass / hepatomegaly** (intrahepatic CCA)

Each scenario has its own differential. Let's work through them systematically.

### A. Differential Diagnosis of Obstructive Jaundice (Extrahepatic CCA)

When a patient presents with **painless progressive obstructive jaundice**, you need to think about causes at **three anatomical levels**: intraluminal, mural, and extramural. This is the classic surgical approach [8].

***Painless progressive obstructive jaundice in elderly is malignant biliary obstruction until proven otherwise*** [8]

#### Differentiating Stone vs Tumour

This is one of the most important clinical distinctions to make at the bedside. The history alone often tells you the answer [8]:

| Feature | ***Stone*** | ***Tumour*** |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| ***Jaundice*** | ***Intermittent (stone may pass out)*** | ***Progressive. For HCC, jaundice only when functional liver reserve drops to 25%*** |
| ***Pain*** | ***Painful: as stones go through Ampulla of Vater*** | ***Painless (until advanced). Except CA pancreatic head: well innervated, spread to coeliac ganglion early*** |
| ***Infection (fever)*** | ***More likely: accumulation of bile refluxed from GI tract (normally prevented by ampulla of Vater)*** | ***Until late stage, malnourished*** |
| ***Others*** | | ***Constitutional Sx: LOW, LOA, night sweats*** |

**Why is stone jaundice intermittent but tumour jaundice progressive?**
- A gallstone can act as a ball-valve — sometimes it obstructs the CBD, sometimes it dislodges and bile flows again. Hence the jaundice waxes and wanes.
- A tumour grows relentlessly. Once it narrows the duct, it only gets worse. The obstruction never relieves spontaneously.

**Why is stone disease more commonly associated with fever?**
- When a stone obstructs the CBD, stagnant bile becomes infected (bacteria from the duodenum reflux upwards). The stone creates a closed space → pressure builds → bacteria translocate into the bloodstream → cholangitis/sepsis.
- Tumours obstruct more gradually, and until the duct is completely occluded, some bile still flows → less stasis → less infection (until late stage).

#### 1. Malignant Causes of Biliary Obstruction (MBO)

***Pathology causing malignant biliary obstruction:*** [9][10]

**i. Cholangiocarcinoma at hilum (Klatskin tumour)**
- ***Cholangiocarcinoma at hilum, Klatskin tumour*** [9]
- ***Obstruction to just left or right hepatic duct alone will not cause obstructive jaundice*** [1] — you need bilateral obstruction or obstruction at the confluence for clinical jaundice. Why? Because the contralateral liver lobe continues to excrete bilirubin through its unobstructed duct.

**ii. Carcinoma of Head of Pancreas**
- ***Carcinoma of pancreas*** [9]
- The most common cause of malignant obstructive jaundice overall
- 70% of pancreatic cancers are in the head → they compress or invade the intrapancreatic CBD → progressive painless jaundice
- ***Severe epigastric pain radiating to the back*** is characteristic (retroperitoneal infiltration of coeliac plexus) — but this is a feature of body/tail tumours rather than head tumours [11]
- ***Double duct sign*** on CT/MRCP: simultaneous dilatation of both the CBD and pancreatic duct — highly suggestive of pancreatic head cancer [11]

**iii. Periampullary Carcinoma**
- ***Periampullary carcinoma*** [9][10]
- This is a group term for tumours arising at or near the ampulla of Vater, including:
  - ***Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater*** — has the **best prognosis** among periampullary tumours because it presents **earlier** (even a small tumour at the ampulla blocks bile flow and causes jaundice) [1]
  - ***Carcinoma of the duodenum*** [9][10]
  - ***Carcinoma of lower end of (distal) CBD*** [1]
  - ***Carcinoma of head of pancreas*** [1]
- These are grouped because their presentation (painless jaundice) and surgical management (Whipple procedure) are similar [1]

**iv. Carcinoma of Gallbladder**
- ***Carcinoma of gallbladder — cystic duct LN, direct infiltration of CBD, tumour fragments*** [9]
- Can cause obstructive jaundice by three mechanisms [1]:
  - Spread to cystic duct lymph nodes → extrinsic compression of CBD
  - Direct infiltration of CBD
  - Tumour fragments breaking off into the CBD

**v. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**
- ***HCC — direct infiltration, compression, tumour fragments in CBD*** [9]
- ***Usually occurs when mass is situated near confluence site of left and right intrahepatic ducts*** [1]
  - ***From anterior liver = Segment 4/5*** [1]
  - ***From posterior liver = Caudate segment (uncommon)*** [1]
- HCC causing obstructive jaundice is NOT common — it is much more likely to cause jaundice from **loss of hepatic reserve** in the cirrhotic liver [12]

**vi. Secondary Lymphadenopathy**
- ***Porta lymphadenopathy*** [10]
- ***Lymph node metastases to the coeliac axis or porta hepatis*** [13]
- ***Carcinoma of stomach with metastatic lymph node in the porta hepatis*** [13]
- ***GI malignancy (CRC), Lymphoma*** [1]
- Extrinsic compression of the bile duct by enlarged lymph nodes at the hepatoduodenal ligament

<Callout title="Causes of MBO by Level of Obstruction" type="idea">

Think anatomically — what structure is obstructed and at which level? [1]

**Hilum:** CA gallbladder, HCC, Klatskin tumour, Mirizzi syndrome, Porta lymphadenopathy, PSC, RPC

**Mid-CBD:** CA CBD, CA head of pancreas, Lymphadenopathy

**Distal CBD:** Bile duct strictures, Periampullary carcinoma, Choledochal cysts, Pancreatic cysts, Chronic pancreatitis
</Callout>

#### 2. Benign Causes of Biliary Obstruction

***Benign causes of biliary obstruction:*** [1]

**i. Choledocholithiasis**
- ***Choledocholithiasis*** [2]
- Most common benign cause of obstructive jaundice
- Key differentiating feature: **intermittent jaundice with pain and fever** (Charcot's triad) vs. the painless progressive jaundice of CCA

**ii. Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)**
- ***Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)*** [2]
- Creates multifocal strictures with a "beaded" appearance on MRCP
- Important: PSC itself is a **risk factor** for CCA, and a **dominant stricture** in PSC may represent superimposed CCA → always suspect malignancy in any PSC patient with worsening jaundice or a new dominant stricture
- ***Common in Westerners, less common in Asia*** [3]

**iii. IgG4-Related Sclerosing Cholangitis**
- A critical mimic of CCA! Can produce a stricture that looks identical to CCA on imaging
- Elevated serum IgG4 level is a clue
- **Responds dramatically to corticosteroids** — which CCA obviously does not
- Always check ***serum IgG4*** before assuming a biliary stricture is malignant [2]

<Callout title="IgG4-Related Cholangitis vs CCA" type="error">
This is a classic exam pitfall and a real clinical trap. IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis can mimic CCA so closely that patients undergo unnecessary surgery. Always check IgG4 levels in any patient with a biliary stricture, especially if there is concurrent autoimmune pancreatitis (type 1). A trial of steroids may be warranted before committing to surgery.
</Callout>

**iv. Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)**
- ***Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)*** [2] (now renamed Primary Biliary Cholangitis)
- Autoimmune destruction of small intrahepatic bile ducts
- Anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) positive
- Predominantly affects middle-aged women
- Causes **intrahepatic** cholestasis rather than extrahepatic obstruction — so it causes cholestatic LFTs and pruritus, but the bile ducts are NOT dilated on imaging

**v. Other Benign Causes**
- ***Blood clot (Haemobilia) / Mucus / Foreign body / Tumour thrombus*** [1]
- ***Benign strictures: TB, Autoimmune, Iatrogenic, RPC*** [1]
- ***Chronic pancreatitis, Pancreatic cysts*** [1]
- ***Mirizzi syndrome — common hepatic duct obstruction caused by extrinsic compression from an impacted stone in the cystic duct or Hartmann's pouch of the gallbladder*** [1]

### B. Differential Diagnosis of Liver Mass / Hepatomegaly (Intrahepatic CCA)

When intrahepatic CCA presents as a liver mass, the differential is that of **any hepatic space-occupying lesion** [14]:

***Malignant liver tumours:*** [14]
- ***Primary: Hepatocellular carcinoma, Cholangiocarcinoma, Others (e.g. lymphoma)*** [14]
- ***Secondary: Metastasis from GI tract, Metastasis from other primary*** [14]

#### 1. Primary Malignant Liver Tumours

| Tumour | Key Distinguishing Features |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| ***Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)*** | ***MC primary liver cancer (80%)*** [12]. AFP elevated. Arterial enhancement with portal venous washout on CT/MRI. Associated with HBV, cirrhosis. HepPar-1+, CK7− |
| **Intrahepatic CCA** | CK7+, CK19+, AFP negative. Peripheral rim enhancement, delayed central enhancement on CT. Desmoplastic stroma. Associated with PSC, RPC, flukes |
| ***Fibrolamellar carcinoma*** | ***Younger patients, not associated with HBV or cirrhosis; good prognosis*** [12]. Central scar with calcification. AFP usually normal |
| ***Hemangioendothelioma*** | Rare vascular tumour. Multiple hepatic nodules. Can occur in young adults |
| **Combined HCC-CCA** | Rare mixed tumour. AFP may be elevated. Behaves more aggressively than either alone |

**How to distinguish iCCA from HCC on imaging?**
- **HCC:** Arterial hyperenhancement → portal venous **washout** (the tumour "lights up then fades"). Classic LIRADS-5 pattern.
- **iCCA:** Peripheral arterial rim enhancement → progressive **centripetal fill-in** on delayed phase (because the dense desmoplastic stroma enhances slowly). Does NOT show washout.

#### 2. Benign Primary Liver Tumours

| Tumour | Key Features |
|--------|-------------|
| ***Haemangioma*** | Most common benign liver tumour. Peripheral nodular enhancement with centripetal fill-in (but slower and more complete than iCCA). Bright on T2 MRI |
| ***Hepatic adenoma*** | Associated with OCP use. Risk of haemorrhage and malignant transformation |
| ***Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)*** | Central scar. Homogeneous arterial enhancement. No malignant potential |

#### 3. Metastatic / Secondary Liver Tumours

***Metastatic carcinoma to liver is commoner than primary liver cancer*** [15]
***Commonest site from GI tract (portal venous circulation): colorectal, stomach, pancreas*** [15]

- Always look for a **primary source** — CRC is the most common (CEA elevated), followed by gastric, pancreatic, breast, lung
- ***Elevated CEA or CA 19-9 in some cases with primary GI malignancy*** [15]
- ***Investigation for primary: CXR, endoscopy, CT scan abdomen*** [15]
- Multiple liver lesions with a known primary → likely metastatic rather than primary liver cancer

#### 4. Other Causes

- ***Cysts (simple cyst, polycystic disease)*** [14]
- ***Liver abscess*** (pyogenic or amoebic) — fever, raised WCC, rim-enhancing lesion with internal debris
- ***Haematological malignancies (lymphoma, leukaemia, myeloproliferative disease)*** [14]

---

### C. Other Conditions Mimicking CCA

**i. Recurrent Pyogenic Cholangitis (RPC)**
- Can cause biliary strictures that mimic CCA on cholangiography
- ***Complications of RPC include cholangiocarcinoma*** [5] — so RPC and CCA can coexist
- Key clue: ***intrahepatic pigment stones, left lobe predilection, middle-age onset, recurrent cholangitis episodes*** [5]

**ii. Choledochal Cysts**
- ***Complications: cholangiocarcinoma*** [6]
- A choledochal cyst with a mural nodule or wall thickening should raise suspicion for malignant transformation

**iii. Viral Hepatitis**
- ***Viral hepatitis*** [2]
- Acute viral hepatitis can cause cholestatic LFTs mimicking biliary obstruction
- Key differences: hepatocellular pattern (ALT >> ALP), positive viral serology, no bile duct dilatation on imaging

---

### D. Pathology Producing Jaundice AND Epigastric Mass

This is a specific clinical scenario worth highlighting as it comes directly from the lecture [13]:

***Pathology producing jaundice and epigastric mass:*** [13]
- ***Hepatomegaly secondary to biliary obstruction***
- ***Hepatomegaly due to metastases or HCC***
- ***Lymph node metastases to the coeliac axis or porta hepatis***
- ***Carcinoma of stomach with metastatic lymph node in the porta hepatis***
- ***Distended stomach due to duodenal obstruction by tumour which obstructs the bile duct as well***

---

### E. Summary: DDx Listed by Felix Notes [2]

***Differential diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma:***
- ***Choledocholithiasis***
- ***Viral hepatitis***
- ***Hepatocellular carcinoma***
- ***Malignant obstruction of biliary tract:***
  - ***Pancreatic cancer***
  - ***Cancer of the ampulla of Vater***
- ***Intrahepatic cholestasis:***
  - ***Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)***
  - ***Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)***

---

### F. Key Differentiating Investigations (Preview)

When working up the differential, the following investigations help narrow the diagnosis:

| Investigation | What it tells you |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **LFT pattern** | Cholestatic (ALP >> ALT) = obstruction; Hepatocellular (ALT >> ALP) = hepatitis/HCC |
| **AFP** | Elevated → HCC (or rarely combined HCC-CCA). Normal in pure CCA |
| **CA 19-9** | Elevated in CCA, but also in CA pancreas, cholangitis, gallstones — not specific [2] |
| **CEA** | Elevated in CRC metastasis, can be mildly elevated in CCA [2] |
| ***IgG4*** | Elevated → IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (mimic of CCA) [2] |
| **AMA** | Positive → PBC |
| **Viral serology** | HBsAg/Anti-HCV → viral hepatitis / HCC risk |
| **USG** | Dilated ducts (obstruction) vs. mass lesion vs. stones |
| **CT/MRI** | Characterise mass, determine level of obstruction, assess resectability |
| ***FNAC/Trucut biopsy*** | ***ONLY for unresectable cases*** [3] — avoids needle-track seeding in potentially resectable disease |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Clinical approach to DDx:**
1. Determine if presentation is obstructive jaundice (extrahepatic CCA) or liver mass (intrahepatic CCA)
2. For obstructive jaundice: differentiate stone vs tumour (intermittent/painful/fever vs progressive/painless/constitutional)
3. For liver mass: differentiate HCC vs iCCA vs metastasis (AFP, imaging characteristics, IHC)

**Malignant causes of biliary obstruction (must know list from lectures):**
- CCA at hilum (Klatskin tumour)
- CA head of pancreas
- Periampullary carcinoma (ampulla, duodenum, distal CBD)
- CA gallbladder (cystic duct LN, direct infiltration, tumour fragments)
- HCC (compression from Seg 4/5, direct infiltration, tumour fragments in CBD)
- Porta lymphadenopathy (CRC, lymphoma, gastric cancer)

**Critical mimics of CCA:**
- IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (check IgG4, responds to steroids)
- PSC with dominant stricture (beaded appearance on MRCP)
- RPC (intrahepatic pigment stones, left lobe predilection)

**Key rule:** Painless progressive obstructive jaundice in elderly = malignant biliary obstruction until proven otherwise.
