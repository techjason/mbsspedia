## Complications of Necrotizing Fasciitis

### The Big Picture

NF is one of the most devastating infections a patient can experience. Even with optimal management, complications are the rule, not the exception. They arise from three interrelated sources:

1. **The disease itself** — direct tissue destruction, systemic toxicity, and the septic cascade
2. **The treatment** — radical debridement and amputation carry their own morbidity
3. **The critical illness** — prolonged ICU stay, immobility, and organ support

I find it useful to organise complications using a **temporal framework** (immediate, early, late) combined with a **local vs systemic** distinction, because this maps onto clinical decision-making: immediate complications kill the patient today, early complications kill them this week, and late complications affect quality of life for years.

### Systematic Classification of Complications

#### A. Immediate / Life-Threatening Complications (Hours to Days)

These are the complications that will kill your patient if you don't anticipate and treat them.

| Complication | Mechanism (First Principles) | Clinical Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| **Sepsis → Septic shock → Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS)** | Bacterial toxins (endotoxins, superantigens) trigger massive systemic inflammatory response → vasodilation → distributive shock → inadequate organ perfusion → sequential organ failure (lungs → kidneys → liver → brain → heart). ***Necrosis in multiple tissue layers*** [1] releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that amplify the inflammatory cascade beyond the infectious source. | The leading cause of death in NF. This is why ***mortality ranges from 20 to 75%*** [1]. Every hour of delayed debridement allows more toxins into the systemic circulation, worsening the septic cascade. The source must be removed surgically — antibiotics alone cannot penetrate avascular necrotic tissue. |
| **Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (STSS)** | Group A Streptococcus produces superantigens (SPE-A, SPE-B, SPE-C) that bypass normal antigen presentation and directly activate up to 20% of T-cells (vs. < 0.01% in normal immune response) → massive cytokine storm (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ) → capillary leak, vasodilation, myocardial depression, DIC. | Occurs specifically in Type II (GAS) NF. Presents with ***generalised erythematous rash and toxic appearance*** [1], hypotension, and multiorgan failure. This is why ***IV penicillin G + IV linezolid*** [4] is the regimen — linezolid suppresses superantigen production. IVIG may be considered as adjunct (neutralises circulating superantigens). |
| **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)** | Tissue factor release from necrotic tissue + bacterial endotoxins → simultaneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis → microvascular thrombosis throughout the body → consumption of clotting factors and platelets → paradoxical bleeding tendency. | Manifests as ***low platelet count*** [1], prolonged PT/aPTT, low fibrinogen, elevated D-dimer. Clinically: bleeding from wound edges, IV sites, mucosal surfaces; simultaneously, microvascular thrombi cause organ ischaemia (renal cortical necrosis, hepatic ischaemia, peripheral gangrene). Treatment: treat the underlying cause (debridement), replace consumed factors (FFP, cryoprecipitate, platelets). |
| **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)** | Multi-factorial: (1) Pre-renal — hypovolaemia from third-spacing and sepsis-induced vasodilation; (2) Intrinsic — acute tubular necrosis from myoglobin (if myonecrosis/rhabdomyolysis), sepsis-mediated tubular injury, nephrotoxic drugs (aminoglycosides, IV contrast); (3) ***Renal insufficiency*** as both a risk factor and consequence [1]; ***NSAIDs develop acute renal failure*** [1]. | Monitor urine output (catheterise), serial creatinine. Management: aggressive fluid resuscitation, avoid nephrotoxins, renal replacement therapy (CVVHDF) if severe. Rhabdomyolysis-related AKI requires IV bicarbonate (alkalinise urine to prevent myoglobin precipitation in tubules) and mannitol diuresis [8]. |
| **Rhabdomyolysis** | When infection extends to muscle (myonecrosis — particularly in gas gangrene), widespread muscle cell death releases intracellular contents: **creatine kinase (CK)**, **myoglobin**, and **potassium** into the systemic circulation. Myoglobin is freely filtered by the glomerulus but precipitates in acidic urine → obstructive acute tubular necrosis [8]. | Characterised by massively elevated CK ( > 5× normal), dark "tea-coloured" urine (myoglobinuria), and hyperkalaemia → risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Management: aggressive hydration, IV bicarbonate to alkalinise urine, mannitol for osmotic diuresis, continuous cardiac monitoring for arrhythmias [8]. |
| **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)** | Systemic inflammatory response → pulmonary capillary endothelial injury → increased alveolar-capillary permeability → protein-rich pulmonary oedema → surfactant dysfunction → alveolar collapse → refractory hypoxaemia. | Develops in severe sepsis; presents with progressive dyspnoea, bilateral infiltrates on CXR, PaO2/FiO2 < 300. Requires mechanical ventilation with lung-protective strategy (low tidal volumes 6 mL/kg IBW, PEEP, plateau pressure < 30 cmH2O). |

<Callout title="Why Sepsis Kills in NF — The Vicious Cycle">
NF creates a self-amplifying loop: tissue necrosis → releases toxins and DAMPs → systemic inflammation → vasodilation and capillary leak → hypoperfusion → more tissue ischaemia → more necrosis → more toxins. The only way to break this cycle is to **remove the necrotic tissue surgically**. Antibiotics cannot reach the avascular necrotic tissue, and supportive care alone cannot outpace the toxin release. This is why ***aggressive debridement*** [3] is the cornerstone.

#### B. Early Complications (Days to Weeks)

These develop during the hospitalisation period, related to ongoing wound management, ICU stay, and the initial surgical intervention.

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Wound infection / Secondary sepsis** | Open wounds after debridement are colonised by nosocomial organisms (MRSA, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter); immunocompromised state from critical illness; repeated surgical procedures | Serial wound cultures; targeted antibiotics; careful wound care; VAC therapy to maintain clean wound environment |
| **Ongoing tissue necrosis requiring re-debridement** | Initial debridement may not capture all affected tissue — NF spreads along fascial planes beyond visible margins ("iceberg phenomenon"); residual bacteria continue to advance | ***Relook debridement every 24–48 hours*** until wound is clean; mark wound margins to track progression |
| **Massive blood loss / Transfusion requirements** | Repeated surgical debridements of large, raw wound surfaces; DIC-related coagulopathy; loss of haemostasis | Crossmatch and blood product availability; correct coagulopathy; intra-operative attention to haemostasis |
| **Electrolyte derangements** | Hyperkalaemia (from rhabdomyolysis / tissue necrosis / AKI); hyponatraemia (SIADH, third-spacing); hypocalcaemia (calcium binds to necrotic fat, consumed in DIC) | Regular monitoring (at least 6–12 hourly in ICU); ECG monitoring for hyperkalaemia; replacement as needed |
| **Nutritional deficiency / Catabolic state** | Massive tissue loss + sepsis → hypercatabolic state with accelerated protein breakdown; wound healing demands enormous protein/calorie/micronutrient supply | Early enteral nutrition (high-protein, high-calorie); supplement zinc, vitamin C, vitamin A for wound healing; may require parenteral nutrition if enteral not tolerated |
| **VTE (DVT / Pulmonary embolism)** | Virchow's triad: immobility (bedridden in ICU), endothelial injury (sepsis-related), hypercoagulable state (acute-phase response, DIC paradox) | Pharmacological prophylaxis (LMWH) once haemostasis adequate; mechanical prophylaxis (pneumatic compression devices); early mobilisation when possible |
| **Pressure injuries (bed sores)** | Prolonged immobility + poor nutrition + tissue oedema → pressure necrosis over bony prominences (sacrum, heels, occiput) | Regular repositioning (every 2 hours); pressure-relieving mattress; nutritional optimisation; skin assessment |
| **ICU-acquired weakness** | Prolonged critical illness → critical illness myopathy (direct effect of sepsis, steroids, NMBAs on muscle) and critical illness polyneuropathy (axonal degeneration from systemic inflammation) | Early mobilisation and physiotherapy; minimise sedation and neuromuscular blockade; adequate nutrition |
| **Antibiotic-related complications** | Prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotics → *Clostridioides difficile* colitis; drug-related nephrotoxicity (aminoglycosides); drug allergy/hypersensitivity; bone marrow suppression (linezolid with prolonged use) | Monitor for diarrhoea; de-escalate antibiotics based on cultures; therapeutic drug monitoring where applicable; monitor CBC with prolonged linezolid |

#### C. Late Complications (Weeks to Months to Lifetime)

These are the complications that affect the patient long after they leave the hospital — and they are often the most devastating to quality of life.

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Impact |
|---|---|---|
| ***Amputation*** [1] — ***HK figure: radical debridements (amputations and disarticulations) were performed in 46% of 24 patients*** [1] | When tissue necrosis is too extensive for limb salvage, or when the patient's life is threatened by ongoing sepsis from the limb, amputation is necessary [1]. Indications include ***myonecrosis, unremitting shock, concurrent peripheral vascular insufficiency, rapidly progressive infection, large area of tissue necrosis*** [1]. | Life-altering: functional disability, prosthetic dependence, chronic pain, altered body image. ***BKA: 90% walk again; AKA: 50% walk again*** [6]. |
| **Disfiguring scars / Contractures** | Extensive tissue loss + healing by secondary intention or skin grafting → scar tissue formation → wound contraction; fascial loss removes normal tissue planes | May require multiple reconstructive surgeries (skin grafts, flaps); physiotherapy to prevent contractures; silicone sheets/pressure garments for scar management |
| **Chronic pain** | Neuropathic pain from nerve damage during the disease or surgery; central sensitisation from prolonged pain experience; myofascial pain from altered biomechanics | Gabapentin, pregabalin, amitriptyline for neuropathic pain; multidisciplinary pain team; physiotherapy |
| **Chronic wounds / Non-healing wounds** | Underlying risk factors persist (***DM***, ***PVD***, ***immunocompromised*** [1]); poor blood supply to grafted areas; repeated infections | VAC therapy, specialist wound care, optimisation of comorbidities (glycaemic control, nutrition, cessation of smoking) |
| **Psychological complications** | PTSD (emergency surgery, ICU stay, disfigurement); depression; anxiety; body image disturbance; social isolation | Psychiatric / psychological referral; peer support groups; cognitive behavioural therapy; pharmacotherapy if needed |

#### D. Complications Specific to Amputation [6][7]

If the patient undergoes amputation as part of NF management, there is a specific set of complications:

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism / Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ***Early*** | ***Bleeding and haematoma formation*** [6] | Surgical vessel injury; ongoing coagulopathy from DIC |
| | ***Wound infection*** [6] | Contaminated surgical field (NF is by definition an infected wound); immunocompromised host |
| | ***Phantom limb pain*** [6] | Cortical reorganisation — the somatosensory cortex retains a "map" of the amputated limb; peripheral nerve sprouting from transected nerve ends generates aberrant signals interpreted as pain from the missing limb. Management: reassurance, amitriptyline, gabapentin [7] |
| | ***Skin necrosis*** [6] — ***secondary to poor perfusion of stump*** [6] | Residual vascular disease (***concurrent peripheral vascular insufficiency*** [1]); inadequate blood supply at amputation level; may require revision to a higher level |
| | **DVT / PE** | Immobility + hypercoagulable septic state; prophylactic heparin [7] |
| ***Late*** | ***Stump ulceration*** [6] | Pressure from prosthesis on poorly vascularised or scarred stump skin |
| | ***Stump neuroma*** [6] | Disorganised nerve regeneration at the cut nerve ends forms a painful, palpable nodule; triggered by pressure or tapping (Tinel's sign positive) |
| | ***Osteomyelitis*** [6] | Residual bone infection from the original NF or secondary contamination of exposed bone |
| | ***Osteophyte formation in underlying bone*** [6] | Reactive new bone growth at the stump end; can irritate overlying soft tissue and cause pain with prosthesis use |
| | ***Fixed flexion deformity*** [6] | Muscle imbalance around the joint proximal to the amputation (e.g., hip flexion contracture after AKA, knee flexion contracture after BKA); unopposed action of flexors; prevented by early physiotherapy, prone positioning, and avoidance of prolonged pillow placement under the stump |
| | ***Difficult mobilisation*** [6] | Combination of all the above + deconditioning from prolonged illness; rehabilitation is prolonged and requires multidisciplinary team |

<Callout title="Phantom Limb Pain — Common Exam Topic" type="idea">
Phantom limb pain affects up to 80% of amputees. It is NOT "in their head" — it has a genuine neurological basis in cortical reorganisation and peripheral nerve sprouting. First-line treatment: reassurance (educate that this is normal and expected), followed by pharmacotherapy: **amitriptyline** (tricyclic antidepressant — modulates descending pain inhibitory pathways) or **gabapentin/pregabalin** (bind α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels → reduce excitatory neurotransmitter release → dampen aberrant nerve signals) [7].

### Complications of NF at Specific Sites

| Site | Unique Complications |
|---|---|
| **Fournier's gangrene (perineum)** | Urethral stricture/fistula; colostomy requirement (if perianal source, faecal diversion may be needed to protect the wound); scrotal skin loss requiring reconstruction (thigh flaps); sexual dysfunction; psychological devastation |
| **Cervical NF (head and neck)** | Airway compromise (oedema, direct tissue destruction) → may require emergency tracheostomy; mediastinitis (descending infection along fascial planes into the mediastinum — mortality > 50%); carotid artery erosion and haemorrhage; jugular vein thrombosis |
| **Abdominal wall NF** | Hernia (loss of fascial integrity → ventral/incisional hernia); peritonitis (if infection tracks intraperitoneally); stoma requirements; massive wound defects requiring complex reconstruction |
| **Extremity NF** | Amputation (***46% of HK patients*** [1]); compartment syndrome [8]; contractures limiting joint range of motion; chronic lymphoedema from disruption of lymphatic drainage |

### Prognostic Factors — What Predicts Worse Outcomes?

| Factor | Why It Worsens Prognosis |
|---|---|
| **Delayed surgical debridement** | Every hour of delay allows further fascial necrosis and systemic toxin release; the single most important modifiable prognostic factor |
| **Truncal / perineal involvement** | Harder to debride radically (cannot amputate the trunk); wider fascial planes allow more extensive spread |
| **Polymicrobial infection (Type I)** | Synergistic bacterial interactions make the infection more aggressive than monomicrobial forms |
| **Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome** | Massive superantigen-driven cytokine storm → refractory shock |
| ***Concurrent medical disease*** [1] | ***DM, liver disease, renal insufficiency, immunocompromised*** [1] — all impair immune response and wound healing |
| **Older age** | Reduced physiological reserve; more comorbidities; slower immune response |
| **Higher LRINEC score** | Reflects more severe systemic derangement at presentation |
| **Bacteraemia** | Indicates systemic dissemination — higher mortality than localised infection |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of NF">

**Immediate/life-threatening**: Sepsis → septic shock → MODS (leading cause of death); STSS (GAS with superantigens); DIC (***low platelet count*** [1]); AKI (pre-renal + intrinsic + ***NSAID-induced*** [1]); rhabdomyolysis (myonecrosis → myoglobin → AKI + hyperkalaemia); ARDS.

**Sequelae of delayed treatment** [1]: ***Amputation in 46% of HK patients; mortality 20–75%*** [1].

**Amputation complications** [6]:
- Early: bleeding, wound infection, ***phantom limb pain*** (Mx: amitriptyline, gabapentin), ***skin necrosis*** (poor stump perfusion)
- Late: ***stump ulceration, stump neuroma, osteomyelitis, osteophyte formation, fixed flexion deformity, difficult mobilisation***

**Late / QoL complications**: disfiguring scars, contractures, chronic pain, chronic wounds, psychological (PTSD, depression, body image).

**Site-specific**: Fournier's → urethral fistula, colostomy; Cervical → mediastinitis, airway compromise; Abdominal → hernia.

**Key prognostic factors**: Time to debridement (most important modifiable factor), truncal involvement, polymicrobial infection, STSS, comorbidities.
