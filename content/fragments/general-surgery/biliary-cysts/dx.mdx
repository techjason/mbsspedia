## Diagnostic Criteria for Biliary Cysts

Unlike conditions such as acute cholangitis (which has codified Tokyo Guidelines criteria) or acute cholecystitis (Tokyo criteria with defined scoring), **biliary cysts do not have a formal "diagnostic criteria" scoring system**. The diagnosis is primarily **imaging-based**, supported by clinical context and biochemistry.

That said, the diagnosis of a biliary cyst requires establishing three things:

1. **Presence of a cystic dilatation** that communicates with the biliary tree.
2. **Classification** of the cyst type (Todani).
3. **Assessment for APBJ** and **exclusion of malignancy**.

Let me walk you through the diagnostic approach logically, from bedside to operating theatre.

<Callout title="Key Diagnostic Principle">
The diagnosis of a biliary cyst is made when imaging demonstrates a cystic dilatation that **communicates with the biliary tree** (distinguishing it from hepatic cysts, pancreatic cysts, or other non-biliary cystic lesions). ***MRCP is the test of choice for diagnosing and evaluating biliary cysts*** [1]. ***USG is the initial diagnostic modality*** [2]. ***CT determines extent*** [2].
</Callout>

## Diagnostic Algorithm

The approach follows a stepwise logic: **Clinical suspicion → Bloods → Initial imaging (USG) → Definitive imaging (MRCP) → Pre-operative planning (CT ± ERCP) → Operative confirmation**.

## Investigation Modalities — Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Biochemical Tests (Blood Investigations)

Blood tests in biliary cysts are often **normal** in uncomplicated cases. They become abnormal when there are complications (cholangitis, pancreatitis, malignancy). Here is what to order and why:

#### a) CBC with Differentials [1]

| Finding | Significance | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Normal | Uncomplicated biliary cyst | No active infection or inflammation |
| ***Leukocytosis (↑ WBC with neutrophil predominance)*** | ***Complicated by acute cholangitis*** [1] | Biliary stasis → bacterial colonization → systemic inflammatory response → bone marrow releases neutrophils |
| Thrombocytopenia | If planning for invasive procedure (ERCP) [15] | Check platelet count to assess bleeding risk before instrumentation |
| Pancytopenia | If secondary biliary cirrhosis has developed | Chronic biliary obstruction → cirrhosis → portal hypertension → hypersplenism → destruction of all cell lines |

#### b) Liver Function Tests (LFT) [1][15]

| Finding | Significance | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| ***Serum liver tests are often normal in patients with biliary cysts*** [1] | Uncomplicated, non-obstructing cyst | Small cysts may not significantly obstruct bile flow |
| ***Hyperbilirubinaemia (↑ conjugated bilirubin)*** | Biliary obstruction | Cyst compresses or obstructs bile duct → conjugated bilirubin cannot be excreted into duodenum → backs up into blood |
| ***Cholestatic pattern (↑ ALP, ↑ GGT)*** [1] | Biliary obstruction | ALP is concentrated on the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes; when bile flow is obstructed, ALP is induced and "leaks" into serum. GGT confirms hepatobiliary origin of ALP elevation (vs. bone). |
| ↑ AST/ALT | Hepatocellular injury from chronic obstruction | Prolonged cholestasis → secondary hepatocyte damage → transaminase leak |

> **Why does obstructive jaundice cause a cholestatic pattern?** Because ALP and GGT are enzymes located on the biliary canalicular membrane. When bile cannot flow (obstruction), there is back-pressure on the canaliculi, inducing synthesis and release of these enzymes into the bloodstream. This is fundamentally different from hepatocellular damage (where AST/ALT are released from damaged hepatocytes).

#### c) Clotting Profile (PT/INR) [15]

| Finding | Significance | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| ↑ PT/INR | ***Coagulopathy due to Vitamin K deficiency from decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins due to obstructive jaundice*** [15] | Bile salts don't reach the duodenum → fat malabsorption → fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, **K**) not absorbed → Vitamin K is essential for hepatic synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, X → coagulopathy |

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl" type="idea">
Always check clotting before any invasive biliary procedure (ERCP, PTC, surgery). If PT is prolonged, give **IV Vitamin K** (phytomenadione) and recheck — if it corrects, the coagulopathy is from cholestasis (Vitamin K deficiency). If it doesn't correct, there is hepatocellular dysfunction (the liver can't make clotting factors even with adequate Vitamin K substrate).
</Callout>

#### d) Serum Amylase / Lipase [1]

| Finding | Significance | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| ***↑ Serum amylase level if complicated by acute pancreatitis*** [1] | Concurrent pancreatitis | APBJ allows biliary-to-pancreatic reflux → activation of pancreatic enzymes within the pancreas → autodigestion → amylase/lipase leak into blood |
| Normal | No concurrent pancreatitis | — |

#### e) Tumour Markers [15]

| Marker | Role | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **CA 19-9** | Screen for cholangiocarcinoma within the cyst | ***CEA and CA 19-9 are often elevated but are not diagnostically useful since they lack sensitivity and specificity*** [15]. CA 19-9 can also be raised in any cholestatic condition (cholangitis, choledocholithiasis) and other GI cancers (pancreatic, gastric, colorectal) [5]. However, a markedly elevated or rising CA 19-9 in a known biliary cyst should raise suspicion for malignant transformation. |
| **CEA** | Adjunctive marker | Similarly non-specific. ***Serial assay after resection might aid in diagnosis of persistent or recurrent disease*** [15]. |
| **AFP** | Differentiate from HCC | If an intrahepatic cystic lesion is found, AFP helps distinguish cholangiocarcinoma (AFP usually normal) from HCC (AFP often elevated) [5]. |

<Callout title="Tumour Markers — Know Their Limitations" type="error">
CA 19-9 and CEA are **not useful as screening tools** for malignancy in biliary cysts. They lack both sensitivity and specificity. A normal CA 19-9 does **not** exclude cholangiocarcinoma. Their main role is in **monitoring** after surgical excision — a rising level post-operatively suggests recurrence.
</Callout>

#### f) Additional Bloods (if indicated)

| Test | When to order | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Blood culture | If cholangitis suspected (fever + jaundice + RUQ pain) | Identify causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy [16] |
| RFT (Renal function) | Pre-operative workup; if sepsis suspected | Assess for hepatorenal syndrome, contrast-induced nephropathy risk, sepsis-related AKI |
| Stool for ova and parasites | Hong Kong / endemic area [4] | Screen for ***Clonorchis sinensis*** which may co-exist with biliary cysts and contribute to cholangitis |

---

### 2. Radiological Investigations

This is the core of biliary cyst diagnosis. Let me walk through each modality in the logical order you'd use clinically:

#### a) Transabdominal Ultrasound (USG) — ***Initial diagnostic modality*** [2]

**Why USG first?**
- Non-invasive, no radiation, no contrast, readily available, cheap, can be done at bedside.
- Excellent for detecting biliary dilatation and gallstones.

**Key Findings in Biliary Cysts:**

| Finding | What It Tells You |
|---|---|
| **Cystic, anechoic structure** continuous with the bile duct | Confirms presence of a biliary cyst |
| **Fusiform or saccular dilatation of the CBD** | Type I cyst |
| **Intrahepatic ductal dilatation** with cystic areas | Type IVa or V |
| ***Dilated CBD ( > 8 mm)*** [9] | Biliary obstruction — but need to distinguish true cyst from reactive dilatation |
| Gallstones within the cyst | Cystolithiasis (complication) |
| Sludge/echogenic material in the cyst | Stasis, possible infection |

**Limitations of USG** [1]:
- ***Results affected by patient's body habitus, presence of bowel gas, and limited visualisation due to overlying structures*** [1].
- ***Frequently misses Type III choledochal cysts*** [1] — because the choledochocele is located in the intraduodenal (intramural) segment of the distal CBD, which is deep in the retroperitoneum behind the duodenum, where bowel gas obscures the view.
- Cannot reliably demonstrate APBJ.
- Cannot fully characterise intrahepatic disease (Type IVa, V).
- Operator-dependent [10].

**In neonates:**
- USG is the first-line investigation for conjugated neonatal jaundice.
- Must distinguish from biliary atresia: ***contracted GB + triangular cord sign*** = biliary atresia [6]; **cystic dilatation of bile duct** = choledochal cyst [6].

> **CBD normal limits** (exam pearl from senior notes): ***CBD limit: 0.1 cm for every 10 years old*** [17]. So a 60-year-old can have a CBD of up to 6 mm normally. Post-cholecystectomy, the CBD may dilate by 1–2 mm as the bile duct assumes a reservoir function. CBD > 8 mm is generally considered pathological [9][17].

#### b) Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) [1]

**When to use:**
- When transabdominal USG is equivocal or limited.
- When Type III (choledochocele) is suspected — EUS provides excellent visualisation of the intraduodenal distal CBD.
- To assess the cyst wall for mural nodularity or solid components (malignancy screening).
- To evaluate the pancreaticobiliary junction.

**Key Advantages:**
- ***Demonstrates extrahepatic biliary cysts and provides detailed images of the cyst wall and pancreaticobiliary junction*** [1].
- ***NOT limited by body habitus, bowel gas, or overlying structures*** [1].
- Can guide FNA if there is a suspicious solid component.

**Limitations:**
- Requires endoscopy (invasive, sedation needed).
- Cannot assess intrahepatic ducts as well as MRCP.
- ***EUS cannot reach the lumen of the bile duct in majority of cases*** [15] — so for detailed cholangiography, MRCP or ERCP is needed.

#### c) Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) — ***Test of choice*** [1][2]

This is the single most important investigation for biliary cysts. Let me explain why from first principles.

**What is MRCP?**
- ***Non-contrast, T2-weighted*** MRI sequence [17].
- T2-weighted images make fluid appear **bright white** (hyperintense). Since bile is fluid, the entire biliary tree "lights up" on T2 sequences, creating a beautiful cholangiogram without needing to inject any contrast.
- "MR" = magnetic resonance; "CP" = cholangiopancreatography ("cholangio-" = bile duct, "pancreat-" = pancreas, "-graphy" = imaging).

**Why is MRCP the test of choice?** [1]

| Advantage | Explanation |
|---|---|
| ***Confirms that the cysts communicate with the biliary tree*** | This is the defining feature that distinguishes a biliary cyst from a hepatic cyst, pancreatic cyst, or other non-biliary lesion |
| **Delineates the full biliary anatomy** | Shows the exact type (Todani classification), extent of intrahepatic involvement, and relationship to hepatic duct confluence |
| **Demonstrates APBJ** | Can show the long common channel where the pancreatic duct joins the CBD outside the duodenal wall — critical for operative planning and malignancy risk assessment |
| ***Does NOT expose patients to ionising radiation*** | Especially important in children (most biliary cysts present < 10 years) |
| ***Does not have risks of cholangitis and pancreatitis associated with ERCP*** [1] | ERCP injects contrast under pressure into the biliary tree, risking cholangitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis. MRCP avoids this entirely. |
| **Non-invasive** | No sedation required (in older children/adults). No endoscopy. |

**Key MRCP Findings in Biliary Cysts:**

| Finding | Todani Type | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Fusiform/saccular CBD dilatation with communication to biliary tree | **Type I** | Most common finding |
| Diverticulum off the CBD | **Type II** | Rare; side-pocket projecting from duct |
| Intraduodenal cystic lesion communicating with distal CBD | **Type III** | Choledochocele |
| Both intra- and extrahepatic cystic dilatation | **Type IVa** | Assess extent of intrahepatic involvement for operative planning |
| Multiple extrahepatic cysts only | **Type IVb** | Less common |
| Multiple saccular intrahepatic dilatations communicating with bile ducts | **Type V** | Caroli disease; look for "central dot sign" (better on CT) |
| Long common channel with pancreatic duct joining CBD > 1 cm from ampulla | **APBJ** | Present in 70–90%; critical prognostic and operative finding |
| Mural nodularity / irregularity within the cyst | **Malignancy** | Suggests cholangiocarcinoma arising within the cyst; requires further workup |

#### d) CT Abdomen with Contrast — ***Determines extent*** [2][1]

**When to use:**
- After MRCP has confirmed and classified the cyst.
- Pre-operative planning: **anatomy**, **extent**, **vascular relationships**, and **malignancy screening**.

**Key CT Findings:**

| Finding | Significance |
|---|---|
| ***Detects all types of biliary cysts including determining intrahepatic disease in patients with Type IV and V*** [1] | Full anatomical mapping |
| ***Demonstrates continuity of cyst with biliary tree*** [1] | Confirms biliary origin |
| ***Examines relationship of cyst to surrounding structures*** [1] | Vascular anatomy (hepatic artery, portal vein) — essential for safe surgical excision |
| ***Evaluates for presence of malignancy*** [1] | Enhancing mural nodule, soft tissue mass within or adjacent to cyst, lymphadenopathy, liver metastases |
| **"Central dot sign"** (Caroli disease) | Portal vein radicle surrounded by dilated intrahepatic duct — pathognomonic for Type V |
| **Calcification within cyst wall** | Chronic cyst; raises concern for malignant transformation |

**Limitations:**
- Radiation exposure (relevant in children — minimise if possible).
- Less detailed biliary anatomy compared to MRCP.
- Not useful for detecting gallstones (***only 75% of gallstones identified on CT*** [17]).

> ***Biliary cysts should be differentiated from cysts that do NOT communicate with the biliary tree including pancreatic, mesenteric and hepatic cysts*** [1]. This is the single most important interpretation point on imaging.

#### e) ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) [1][15]

**What is ERCP?**
- An endoscopic procedure where a duodenoscope is passed to the ampulla of Vater, the bile duct is cannulated, and contrast is injected under fluoroscopy to visualise the biliary tree.
- "Endoscopic" = via endoscope; "Retrograde" = contrast flows backwards (upstream) from the ampulla; "Cholangio-" = bile duct; "Pancreat-" = pancreas; "-graphy" = imaging.

**Role in Biliary Cysts:**
- Largely **replaced by MRCP** as a diagnostic tool [15].
- Still useful when:
  - **Therapeutic intervention** is needed: biliary stenting for cholangitis, sphincterotomy for Type III cyst.
  - **Brush cytology** is needed to evaluate for cholangiocarcinoma.
  - MRCP is contraindicated (e.g., MRI-incompatible implant) or equivocal.

**Key Findings on ERCP:**
- Cholangiogram shows the cystic dilatation and its relationship to the biliary tree.
- Can demonstrate APBJ (long common channel).
- Can identify stones within the cyst.
- Brush cytology of the cyst wall for malignant cells.

**Risks of ERCP** (why we prefer MRCP):
- Post-ERCP **pancreatitis** (3–5% risk) — contrast injection into the pancreatic duct.
- **Cholangitis** — introduction of bacteria into an obstructed system.
- **Perforation** of the duodenum or bile duct.
- **Bleeding** after sphincterotomy.

#### f) Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography (PTC) [17]

**When to use:**
- ***Preferred to ERCP*** when obstruction is ***at or above the level of confluence of hepatic ducts*** [17] — because ERCP approaches from below (retrograde) and cannot easily pass proximal high-grade obstructions.
- Useful in Type IVa with high intrahepatic obstruction.
- Can be combined with **percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD)** for decompression.

**Complications:** ***Bacteraemia (thus antibiotic prophylaxis required), haemobilia*** [17].

#### g) Cholescintigraphy (HIDA Scan) [17][6]

**What is it?**
- ***HIDA*** = Hepatobiliary Iminodiacetic Acid scan. A nuclear medicine study where a technetium-99m-labelled IDA compound is injected IV, taken up by hepatocytes, and excreted into bile.
- You then image the abdomen with a gamma camera to follow the tracer through the biliary tree.

**Role in Biliary Cysts:**
- Primarily used in **neonates** to differentiate biliary cyst from biliary atresia.
- In biliary atresia: ***absence of isotope in the intestine*** [6] (no biliary excretion at all).
- In biliary cyst: Isotope accumulates in the cyst and may eventually reach the intestine (unless completely obstructed).
- ***Pre-treatment with 5 days of phenobarbitone*** (a liver enzyme inducer that increases biliary secretion) improves the sensitivity of the test [6].

#### h) Operative Cholangiogram [6]

- ***Gold standard for confirming the diagnosis*** in paediatric surgery settings [6].
- Performed intra-operatively: contrast is injected directly into the biliary tree via the cystic duct or gallbladder during surgery.
- Delineates the cyst anatomy in real-time, confirms communication with the biliary tree, identifies APBJ, and guides the extent of excision.
- Especially important in neonates where pre-operative imaging may be inconclusive.

### Summary: Investigation Algorithm — The Three-Step Approach

| Step | Modality | Purpose | Key Findings |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Screen** | ***USG*** | Initial diagnostic modality | Cystic dilatation of bile duct; exclude gallstones; assess GB |
| **2. Define** | ***MRCP*** | Test of choice for anatomy | Confirm cyst communicates with biliary tree; classify Todani type; demonstrate APBJ |
| **3. Stage** | ***CT*** | Determine extent + exclude malignancy | Intrahepatic involvement; vascular anatomy; mural nodules; lymphadenopathy; metastases |
| *(If needed)* | ***EUS*** | Distal/equivocal lesions; cyst wall assessment | Type III characterisation; FNA of suspicious nodule |
| *(If needed)* | ***ERCP*** | Therapeutic (stent, sphincterotomy) or tissue sampling | Decompression for cholangitis; brush cytology; Type III treatment |
| *(Neonates)* | ***HIDA scan*** | Differentiate from biliary atresia | Isotope reaches intestine = NOT biliary atresia |
| *(Intra-op)* | ***Operative cholangiogram*** | Gold standard confirmation | Real-time biliary anatomy; confirms APBJ; guides excision |

### 3. Special Considerations

#### Neonatal Diagnostic Approach

In a neonate with conjugated jaundice, the diagnostic pathway is specifically designed to differentiate biliary cyst from biliary atresia as rapidly as possible:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Neonate with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia\n(dark urine, pale stool, hepatomegaly)"] --> B["Urgent USG Abdomen"]
    B -->|"Cystic dilatation of bile duct"| C["Likely choledochal cyst\n→ MRCP to confirm"]
    B -->|"Contracted GB + triangular cord sign"| D["Suspect biliary atresia\n→ HIDA scan"]
    B -->|"Equivocal"| D
    D -->|"No isotope in intestine"| E["Biliary atresia confirmed\n→ Diagnostic laparoscopy +\noperative cholangiogram + liver biopsy"]
    D -->|"Isotope reaches intestine"| F["Biliary atresia less likely\n→ Consider choledochal cyst\nor medical causes"]
    C --> G["Surgery: Cyst excision +\nRoux-en-Y HJ"]
    E --> H["Kasai procedure\nwithin 60 days"]
```

#### Assessment for Malignancy Within a Known Biliary Cyst

For any patient with a known biliary cyst (especially Type I or IVa, and especially if age > 20), you must actively look for malignant transformation:

| Investigation | Finding Suggesting Malignancy |
|---|---|
| **CT with contrast** | Enhancing solid component / mural nodule within the cyst; lymphadenopathy; liver metastases |
| **MRCP** | Irregularity of cyst wall; stricture within adjacent bile duct |
| **EUS + FNA** | Cytology showing malignant cells from cyst wall nodule |
| **ERCP + brush cytology** | Malignant cells on biliary brushings |
| **CA 19-9** | Markedly elevated or rapidly rising (though non-specific) |
| **PET-CT** | FDG-avid lesion within the cyst wall |

<Callout title="High Yield Exam Points">

1. ***USG = Diagnostic; MRCP = Anatomy; CT = Extent*** — this is the investigation triad for biliary cysts [2].
2. ***MRCP is the test of choice*** — confirms biliary communication, classifies type, demonstrates APBJ, no radiation, no risk of cholangitis/pancreatitis [1].
3. ***USG frequently misses Type III cysts*** due to bowel gas obscuring the intraduodenal segment [1].
4. ***Blood tests are often normal*** in uncomplicated biliary cysts [1].
5. In neonates, the critical DDx is **biliary atresia** — HIDA scan (absence of intestinal isotope) and ***operative cholangiogram (gold standard)*** differentiate the two [6].
6. CA 19-9 and CEA are ***not diagnostically useful*** for screening but are used for ***monitoring after excision*** [15].
7. Always assess for **APBJ** and **malignancy** as part of the diagnostic workup — these dictate the surgical approach and urgency.
