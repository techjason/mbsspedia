### Etiology & Pathophysiology

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="Define chronic arterial insufficiency. What is the key distinction from acute limb ischaemia?">
Chronic arterial insufficiency is a **gradual reduction in limb perfusion** developing over **> 2 weeks**, most commonly due to **atherosclerosis** (> 95%).

The key distinction is **time**: chronicity allows **collateral vessel formation** (via VEGF/HIF-1α-mediated angiogenesis), which is why patients tolerate chronic occlusion far better than acute. Acute ischaemia has **no collaterals** → 6 P's → surgical emergency.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the risk factors for PAD? Which is the single most important modifiable risk factor?">
**Smoking, Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, Hyperlipidaemia, Family history.**

**Smoking** is the **single most important modifiable risk factor** — risk of PAD is **3–4× higher** in smokers. It causes endothelial damage, promotes thrombosis (↑ fibrinogen, ↑ platelet aggregation), ↑ LDL oxidation, and vasoconstriction.

**Key principle**: ***Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease*** — always assess for IHD and carotid disease. PAD patients have **2–3× increased cardiovascular mortality**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the Fontaine classification? At what stage does critical limb ischaemia begin?">
| Stage | Description | Features |
|---|---|---|
| **I** | Asymptomatic | Subclinical disease |
| **IIa** | Mild claudication | Claudication distance **> 200m** |
| **IIb** | Moderate-severe claudication | Claudication distance **< 200m** |
| **III** | Ischaemic rest pain | Nocturnal rest pain, relieved by dependency |
| **IV** | Tissue loss | Ulceration, necrosis, or gangrene |

**CLI = Fontaine III + IV** (Rutherford 4–6) = **absolute indication for intervention**. Claudication alone is a **relative** indication.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is Leriche syndrome? State the classic triad.">
**Leriche syndrome** = gradual occlusion of the **terminal aorta** (aortic bifurcation).

Classic triad:
1. **Absent femoral pulses** bilaterally
2. **Bilateral buttock, thigh, and calf claudication**
3. **Erectile dysfunction (impotence)** — bilateral internal iliac artery occlusion → ↓ blood supply via internal pudendal artery to the corpus cavernosum

Always ask about **impotence** in male PAD patients — it may be the presenting complaint!
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Describe Buerger's disease. What is the only effective treatment?">
**Thromboangiitis obliterans** — a **non-atherosclerotic**, segmental, inflammatory disease.

Key features: **Young (30–40s), Male, Heavy smokers**. **Pan-arteriitis** of **medium and small** arteries **AND veins**. **Lower limb > upper limb**. Presents with digital ischaemia, rest pain, ischaemic ulcers, gangrene.

Angiography: ***"tree trunk" pattern*** — abrupt segmental occlusions with collaterals resembling tree roots.

**Only effective treatment: absolute smoking cessation.** Reconstruction is seldom possible (small distal vessels).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which artery is most commonly affected in PAD and why?">
The **superficial femoral artery (SFA)** — accounts for **~70%** of symptomatic PAD.

Why? The SFA runs through the **adductor (Hunter's) canal**, where it is subject to **repetitive mechanical stress** (compression and flexion with every step). This chronic trauma to the arterial wall predisposes to intimal injury and accelerated atherosclerosis.

The **profunda femoris** is the **most important collateral channel** — when the SFA is occluded, profunda perforating branches keep the distal limb alive.

### Differential Diagnosis

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="Compare vascular claudication with neurogenic claudication (spinal stenosis) — 6 features.">
| Feature | **Vascular Claudication** | **Neurogenic Claudication** |
|---|---|---|
| **Claudication distance** | **Fixed, reproducible** | **Variable** |
| **Pain radiation** | **Distal → proximal** | **Proximal → distal** |
| **Exacerbated by** | **Walking uphill** (↑ O₂ demand) | **Walking downhill** (spine extends → canal narrows) |
| **Relieved by** | **Rest — "Shop window to shop window"** | **Bending over/sitting — "Park bench to park bench"** |
| **Pulses** | **Absent** | **Present** |
| **Associations** | **Atherosclerotic risk factors, trophic changes** | **Back pain, only 10% SLR +ve** |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Differentiate arterial, venous, and neuropathic (diabetic) ulcers.">
| Feature | Arterial Ulcer | Venous Ulcer | Neuropathic Ulcer |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Location** | Pressure points: toes, heel, metatarsal heads | **Gaiter area** (medial malleolus) | **Plantar** surface |
| **Pain** | **Very painful** | Mild aching | **Painless** (neuropathy) |
| **Appearance** | Punched-out, pale base | Shallow, irregular, sloughy | Deep, may probe to bone |
| **Surrounding skin** | Pale, atrophic, hairless | Haemosiderin staining, LDS | Callus, warm foot |
| **Pulses** | **Absent/reduced** | Present | May be present or absent |
| **ABPI** | Low (< 0.9) | Normal | **Falsely elevated (> 1.3)** — calcification |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Differentiate acute from chronic limb ischaemia in 4 key features.">
| Feature | Acute | Chronic |
|---|---|---|
| **Onset** | **< 2 weeks** | **> 2 weeks** |
| **Collaterals** | **Absent** → complete ischaemia | **Present** → incomplete ischaemia |
| **Presentation** | **6 P's**: Pain, Pallor, Pulseless, Perishingly cold, Paraesthesia, Paralysis | Claudication → rest pain → tissue loss |
| **Urgency** | **Surgical emergency** (irreversible damage in 4–6h) | Elective workup (urgent if CLI) |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the five common pitfalls in arterial disease as listed on the lecture slides?">
1. **Mis-diagnosis of claudication** — calling neurogenic or arthritic pain "claudication"
2. **Toe amputation before revascularisation** — treating the end-organ without fixing the cause
3. **Delay recognition of acute ischaemia** — calling acute ischaemia "chronic"
4. **Beware of "leg pain"** — not all leg pain is vascular
5. **"Treating the angiogram"** — intervening on an **asymptomatic** stenosis just because you see it on imaging

### Diagnosis & Investigations

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="State the ABI thresholds and their interpretation.">
| ABI Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| **> 1.3** | **Calcified (non-compressible) artery** — falsely elevated (especially DM) |
| **0.9–1.3** | **Normal** |
| **0.4–0.9** | **Claudication** — arterial obstruction |
| **< 0.4** | **Critical limb ischaemia** — rest pain, ulceration, gangrene |

**ABI < 0.9 = diagnostic of PAD** (sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~99%).

**Pitfall**: Normal resting ABI does NOT exclude PAD — use **exercise treadmill ABI** (positive if drop ≥ 0.2).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is ABI unreliable in diabetics? What alternatives exist?">
Diabetic patients have **medial arterial calcification (Mönckeberg's sclerosis)** → vessels are **incompressible** → cuff cannot occlude them → **falsely elevated ABI** (often > 1.3).

Alternatives:
| Test | Normal | Abnormal | Why It Works |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Toe-brachial index (TBI)** | > 0.7 | < 0.7 = PAD; < 0.3 = CLI | **Digital arteries are spared from calcification** → compressible |
| **TcPO₂** | > 60 mmHg | **> 30 = good healing; < 30 = poor healing** | Directly measures O₂ delivery, bypassing incompressible arteries |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Describe the three phases of a normal arterial Doppler waveform. What does monophasic flow indicate?">
**Normal = triphasic**:
1. **Phase 1** (systolic forward flow): tall, sharp peak
2. **Phase 2** (early diastolic reversal): brief retrograde flow (elastic recoil + high peripheral resistance)
3. **Phase 3** (late diastolic forward flow): small forward blip

**Monophasic flow = severe stenosis/occlusion**. Downstream arterioles are maximally dilated (autoregulatory compensation) → low peripheral resistance → continuous forward flow without reversal.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the indication for arteriography (DSA)? Why is it the gold standard?">
***Arteriography is indicated ONLY when surgery/intervention is planned — NOT used for diagnosis.***

**Gold standard** because:
- **Highest spatial resolution** of any imaging
- Real-time flow assessment
- **Can be diagnostic and therapeutic in the same session** (angioplasty/stenting during DSA)
- Provides the definitive "road map" for surgical planning

**Complications**: contrast allergy, contrast nephropathy, arterial dissection, distal embolisation, pseudoaneurysm.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is Buerger's test and how do you interpret it?">
1. Patient supine → slowly elevate both legs
2. **Buerger's angle** = angle at which foot becomes **pale**
   - Normal: no pallor at 90°
   - Severe ischaemia: **pallor at < 20°** (lower angle = worse disease)
3. Sit patient up, swing legs over bed edge
4. Observe **reactive hyperaemia** — ischaemic limb turns **dusky red/purple** (dependent rubor) due to maximally dilated arterioles filling slowly with deoxygenated blood

**Why it works**: Elevating the leg removes the hydrostatic pressure component. In PAD, the already-low perfusion pressure cannot overcome gravity → pallor.

### Management

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="What is the dual-stream management framework for claudication?">
| Goal | **Improve Survival** | **Improve Symptoms** |
|---|---|---|
| **Interventions** | Risk factor modification + drugs | Exercise + drugs + endovascular + surgery |
| **Specifics** | **Smoking cessation**, DM control, **statin (regardless of lipid level)**, HT control, **antiplatelet** | **Supervised exercise**, cilostazol, naftidrofuryl, pentoxifylline |

**Key concept**: PAD patients die from their **hearts and brains** (MI, stroke), not their legs. Treating survival is just as important as treating the limb.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Name the three claudication drugs. Which is FDA-approved and what is its key contraindication?">
| Drug | Mechanism | Key Point |
|---|---|---|
| **Cilostazol (Pletaal)** | **PDE3 inhibitor** → antiplatelet + vasodilation | **Only FDA-approved** drug for claudication. ↑ walking distance ~50%. **Contraindicated in heart failure of any severity** |
| **Naftidrofuryl (Praxilene)** | **5-HT₂ antagonist** → ↓ platelet aggregation, improves aerobic metabolism | Fewer side effects, moderate efficacy |
| **Pentoxifylline (Trental)** | Rheologic modifier → ↓ blood viscosity | Benefits **not firmly established** |

**Cilostazol CI in HF**: PDE3 inhibitors ↑ cAMP in cardiac myocytes → long-term → arrhythmias and ↑ mortality (milrinone class effect).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the indications for surgical intervention in chronic arterial obstruction?">
Two indications:
1. **Disabling claudication** — failed **6 months** of conservative management (supervised exercise + risk factor modification)
2. **Limb salvage (critical ischaemia)** — rest pain, tissue loss

Put simply:
- **Limb at risk** (CLI) → **absolute indication** for intervention
- **Limb not threatened** (claudication) → **relative indication**

***Never "treat the angiogram"*** — do not intervene on asymptomatic disease (Fontaine I).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does the TASC II classification guide revascularisation strategy?">
| TASC Type | Lesion | Preferred Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Short, focal stenoses | **Endovascular** — excellent result |
| **B** | Multiple stenoses / short occlusions | **Endovascular** preferred |
| **C** | Long stenoses / multiple occlusions | **Open surgery** preferred |
| **D** | Complete long-segment occlusions | **Open surgery** primary |

Additional factors:
- **Life expectancy ≤ 2 years** or **no autogenous vein** → endovascular (PTA)
- **Life expectancy > 2 years** with **autogenous vein available** → surgical bypass (better durability)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the best bypass conduit and why? When are prosthetic grafts acceptable?">
**Great saphenous vein (GSV)** = **conduit of choice**, especially for **below-knee** bypass.

Why? Autologous vein has a **living endothelium** that produces **NO and prostacyclin** (antithrombotic) → superior patency in low-flow, small-calibre vessels. Prosthetic grafts lack this endothelial advantage and thrombose more readily.

**PTFE (prosthetic)** is acceptable for **above-knee** bypass (patency comparable to vein) but has **significantly lower patency below the knee**.

Always ask: has the patient had vein stripping, varicose vein surgery, or CABG harvesting? If GSV unavailable → lesser saphenous, arm veins, or prosthetic.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="State the principle of amputation in PAD. What are the 3 D's?">
***Never amputate digits before revascularisation.*** Always restore inflow first → let demarcation occur → amputate minimum necessary.

**3 D's** (indications):
1. **Dead limb** — irreversible gangrene (delay → sepsis, rhabdomyolysis)
2. **Dangerous limb** — life-threatening infection (wet gangrene, necrotising fasciitis)
3. **Damn nuisance** — un-reconstructable CLI, non-functional limb

**BKA preferred** (preserve knee joint). **AKA if femoral pulse absent** (insufficient supply to heal BKA stump).
</Accordion>

### Complications

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="Why do PAD patients most commonly die — from the leg or the heart?">
**From the heart (and brain).** PAD patients die from **MI and stroke**, not limb loss.

- **2–4× higher MI risk**, **2× higher stroke risk**
- 5-year mortality **~30%** in symptomatic PAD, up to **50%** in CLI
- This is why the lecture slides emphasise **"Improve Survival"** — smoking cessation, DM control, statin (regardless of lipid level), HT control, antiplatelet agents

***Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease*** — you're treating the patient's CV mortality as much as (or more than) the leg.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Explain reperfusion injury. What two major complications can result?">
**During ischaemia**: ATP depletion → hypoxanthine accumulates.

**Upon reperfusion**: O₂ floods in → xanthine oxidase converts hypoxanthine → generates massive **reactive oxygen species (ROS)** → cell membrane damage (lipid peroxidation), ↑ capillary permeability → oedema, neutrophil activation → microvascular occlusion.

Two major complications:
1. **Compartment syndrome** — muscle swelling within non-distensible fascia → intra-compartmental pressure **> 30 mmHg** → capillary occlusion
2. **Rhabdomyolysis** — release of **K⁺** (→ arrhythmia), **myoglobin** (→ AKI by ATN), **H⁺** (→ metabolic acidosis)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="A patient develops severe leg pain post-bypass with palpable pulses. Why doesn't the presence of pulses exclude compartment syndrome?">
**Compartment syndrome is a microvascular problem, not macrovascular.** Systolic BP (~120 mmHg) is far greater than pathological intra-compartmental pressure (~30 mmHg), so large arteries easily transmit pulsatile flow. However, **capillaries** within the compartment are compressed and cannot perfuse muscle.

**Pulselessness is a very late and ominous sign.**

Cardinal sign: **pain out of proportion** to clinical findings. Early clue: **numbness in 1st–2nd toe web space** (deep peroneal nerve compression in anterior compartment — the **most commonly affected** compartment).

Management: **urgent fasciotomy** (medial + lateral incisions, all 4 compartments).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the three stages of bypass graft failure?">
| Stage | Timing | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Early** | < 30 days | **Technical error**, graft kink, thrombosis (inadequate run-off) |
| **Intermediate** | 1 month – 2 years | **Neointimal hyperplasia** (smooth muscle proliferation at anastomotic sites) |
| **Late** | > 2 years | **Atherosclerosis** — progression of native disease in inflow/outflow vessels or within vein graft |

Surveillance: serial duplex at 1, 3, 6 months then annually. PSV ratio > 3 or absolute velocity > 300 cm/s → > 70% stenosis → re-intervene before graft thromboses.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do you manage rhabdomyolysis after revascularisation?">
Rhabdomyolysis releases **K⁺** (→ cardiac arrhythmia), **myoglobin** (→ AKI), and **H⁺** (→ acidosis).

Management:
1. **Aggressive IV hydration** (NS, aim UO > 200 mL/h) — dilute myoglobin, maintain renal perfusion
2. **IV mannitol** — osmotic diuresis to flush myoglobin through tubules
3. **IV sodium bicarbonate** — alkalinise urine (pH > 6.5) → myoglobin less nephrotoxic
4. **Treat hyperkalaemia urgently** — calcium gluconate (cardioprotection), insulin-dextrose, salbutamol, kayexalate, dialysis if refractory
5. **Continuous cardiac monitoring** (ECG) for arrhythmias

**Post-op**: monitor BP/P, urine output, APTT, RFT.
