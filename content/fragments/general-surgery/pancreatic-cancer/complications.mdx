## Complications of Pancreatic Cancer

Complications of pancreatic cancer can be categorised into three broad groups: **(A) complications of the disease itself** (from tumour progression), **(B) complications of treatment** (surgical and non-surgical), and **(C) causes of mortality**. Understanding these from first principles is critical — every complication traces back to either the tumour's anatomical effects, its systemic biological impact, or the consequences of removing/manipulating vital structures.

---

### A. Complications of the Disease (Untreated / Progressive Pancreatic Cancer)

These occur as the tumour grows locally, invades adjacent structures, metastasises, or exerts systemic paraneoplastic effects.

#### 1. Biliary Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **Progressive obstructive jaundice** | Head tumour gradually compresses/invades the intrapancreatic CBD → complete biliary obstruction | Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia → jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, pale stools. If untreated: ***coagulopathy (vitamin K malabsorption), malabsorption, malnutrition, and immune dysfunction*** [3] |
| ***Acute cholangitis*** [1] | Biliary stasis proximal to obstruction → bacterial colonisation of static bile (normally bile is sterile, but stasis allows ascending infection from duodenum) → suppurative infection of the biliary tree | Charcot's triad (fever/rigors, jaundice, RUQ pain) → can progress to Reynolds' pentad (+ hypotension + confusion) = biliary sepsis. ***Biliary sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in MBO*** [3][15] |
| **Secondary biliary cirrhosis** | Prolonged biliary obstruction → chronic cholestasis → periductal fibrosis → eventually cirrhosis | Rare (requires months–years of obstruction); liver failure in advanced cases |

<Callout title="Why Is Cholangitis Dangerous in Pancreatic Cancer?">
In a normal biliary system, the sphincter of Oddi prevents reflux of duodenal bacteria into the bile duct. When a tumour obstructs the distal CBD, bile stagnates → bacteria ascend from the duodenum into the stagnant bile → multiply → cholangitis. If not treated urgently with antibiotics + biliary decompression (ERCP stenting or PTBD), this progresses to **biliary sepsis** — one of the three major causes of death in MBO [3][15].
</Callout>

#### 2. Pancreatic Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Feature |
|---|---|---|
| ***Acute pancreatitis*** [1] | Tumour occludes the main pancreatic duct → upstream ductal hypertension → premature activation of pancreatic enzymes (trypsinogen → trypsin) → autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma | Acute epigastric pain radiating to back, ↑ amylase/lipase > 3× ULN. ***Unexplained pancreatitis in an elderly patient without obvious cause (no gallstones, no alcohol) should prompt imaging for occult pancreatic cancer*** |
| **Exocrine insufficiency** | Pancreatic duct obstruction → loss of exocrine enzyme delivery (lipase, amylase, proteases) to duodenum; clinically significant when > 90% function is lost | ***Steatorrhoea*** (bulky, pale, foul-smelling, floating stools), maldigestion, malabsorption, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, K), weight loss |
| **Endocrine insufficiency** | Tumour destroys islets of Langerhans + secretes diabetogenic factors (adrenomedullin, S100A8) | ***New-onset DM*** — present in ~50% at diagnosis [1] |

#### 3. Gastrointestinal Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Presentation |
|---|---|---|
| **Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO)** | Head/uncinate tumour invades or externally compresses the duodenum (D2/D3) → mechanical obstruction of gastric outflow | Persistent vomiting (often non-bilious if obstruction above ampulla, bilious if below), abdominal distension, succession splash, dehydration, ***hypokalaemic hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis*** (from loss of HCl in vomit), aspiration pneumonia risk [1][2] |
| **GI bleeding** | Tumour erosion into duodenal mucosa or peripancreatic vessels (GDA, splenic artery) | Melaena, haematemesis, iron-deficiency anaemia |
| **Duodenal obstruction** | Direct invasion | Similar to GOO; managed by duodenal stenting or gastrojejunostomy [2] |

#### 4. Vascular Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Feature |
|---|---|---|
| ***Venous thromboembolism (Trousseau syndrome)*** | Tumour-elaborated procoagulants (tissue factor, cancer procoagulant — a cysteine protease that directly activates factor X) + platelet-aggregating factors → ***hypercoagulable state*** | ***Migratory superficial thrombophlebitis***, DVT, PE. ↑ Risk of both arterial and venous thromboembolic events [1] |
| **Portal vein / SMV thrombosis** | Direct tumour invasion or compression of PV/SMV | Portal hypertension → splenomegaly, ascites, variceal bleeding. Can cause mesenteric ischaemia (SMV thrombosis → compromise bowel perfusion) |
| **Splenic vein thrombosis** | Body/tail tumours directly invade or compress the splenic vein (runs along posterior/superior border of pancreatic body) | ***Left-sided (sinistral) portal hypertension*** → isolated gastric varices (NOT oesophageal) → risk of upper GI bleeding |
| **GDA pseudoaneurysm** | Pancreatic enzyme leak (from tumour erosion or post-op fistula) erodes into the GDA wall → weakening → pseudoaneurysm formation | Sentinel bleed → catastrophic intra-abdominal haemorrhage or UGIB. Three signs suggestive of pseudoaneurysm: unexplained GI bleeding, unexplained drop in Hb/Hct, sudden expansion of a pancreatic fluid collection [15] |

#### 5. Metastatic Complications

| Site | Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|---|
| ***Liver*** (most common) | Hepatomegaly, liver failure, ascites, jaundice (from intrahepatic mets even without head tumour) | Tumour replaces functional hepatic parenchyma → synthetic failure (↓ albumin, ↓ clotting factors), portal hypertension |
| ***Peritoneum*** | Malignant ascites, bowel obstruction | Peritoneal carcinomatosis → exudative ascites (high protein, high LDH, positive cytology), serositis, and adhesions causing mechanical small bowel obstruction |
| ***Lung*** | Dyspnoea, cough, haemoptysis, pleural effusion | Haematogenous spread; malignant pleural effusion (exudative) |
| ***Bone*** | Pathological fractures, bone pain, hypercalcaemia | Osteolytic/osteoblastic metastases |

#### 6. Paraneoplastic Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Trousseau syndrome*** | Discussed above under vascular complications [1] |
| ***Pancreatic panniculitis*** | ***Systemic spillage of excess digestive pancreatic enzymes (especially lipase, particularly in acinar cell carcinoma variant) → autodigestion of subcutaneous fat → erythematous subcutaneous nodular fat necrosis, typically on legs*** [1] |
| **Depression** | Occurs with disproportionate frequency even before diagnosis; mechanism unclear (cytokine-mediated central effects, IL-6/TNF-α) |

#### 7. Nutritional / Systemic Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Cancer cachexia*** | Tumour-derived cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1) → proteolysis-inducing factor → skeletal muscle wasting, adipose tissue loss, anorexia. ***Cancer cachexia is a leading cause of mortality in MBO*** [15][16] |
| **Malnutrition** | Combination of: (1) maldigestion/malabsorption (exocrine insufficiency + bile salt deficiency), (2) anorexia from cytokines, (3) GOO preventing adequate intake |
| **Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency** | Vitamin K → coagulopathy; Vitamin D → osteomalacia; Vitamin A → night blindness; Vitamin E → neuropathy |

### B. Complications of Treatment

#### 1. Whipple's Operation (Pancreaticoduodenectomy) — Specific Surgical Complications

This is one of the most technically demanding operations in surgery, with a perioperative mortality of 2–5% in high-volume centres and a morbidity rate of 30–50%.

##### Early Complications

| Complication | Incidence | Pathophysiology | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) leak*** | ***~30%*** [2] | ***Highest leak risk*** of the three anastomoses because: (1) pancreatic enzymes actively digest the anastomosis, (2) the pancreatic duct is often ***small and soft*** (normal pancreas without upstream dilatation), (3) the parenchyma is friable. Leak of activated digestive enzymes causes local tissue destruction | ***Biochemical leak (asymptomatic)***: maintain oral feeding, drain in situ for 3 weeks. ***Symptomatic (Grade B)***: NPO, NJ feeding, correct fluids/electrolytes, drain in situ, antibiotics, somatostatin analogue. ***Grade C***: re-operation, may require completion distal pancreatectomy [2][14] |
| ***Pancreatic fistula*** | Related to PJ leak | ***Definition: drain output of any volume after post-op day 3 with drain amylase > 3× ULN*** [2][14]. Risk factors: ***high BMI, soft pancreas, narrow duct*** [2] | As above (ISGPF classification — biochemical leak, Grade B, Grade C) [14] |
| ***GDA pseudoaneurysm*** | Rare but lethal | PJ leak → pancreatic enzymes (elastase) erode into GDA stump → pseudoaneurysm → rupture → ***catastrophic intra-abdominal haemorrhage or UGIB*** [2][14][15] | ***Angiography*** (diagnostic + therapeutic embolisation); if unstable → emergency re-laparotomy |
| ***Portal / splenic vein thrombosis*** | | PJ leak → local inflammation → venous thrombosis [2][14] | Anticoagulation; monitor for mesenteric ischaemia |
| **Biliary anastomotic leak (CJ)** | Less common than PJ | Bile leak from choledochojejunostomy → bile peritonitis | Percutaneous drainage ± re-operation |
| ***Delayed gastric emptying (DGE)*** | ***Common*** [1][2] | ***Especially in PPPD. Mechanisms: (1) Injury to nerve of Latarjet*** (anterior vagal branch supplying pylorus/antrum), ***(2) Disruption of duodenal pacemaker cells*** (interstitial cells of Cajal in the resected duodenum normally coordinate gastric emptying), ***(3) Reduced CCK*** (cholecystokinin — high concentration in duodenal mucosa, now resected) [2] | Prokinetics (metoclopramide, erythromycin), NJ feeding to maintain nutrition, usually self-resolving over weeks |
| **Haemorrhage** | | Intra-operative vascular injury or post-op from anastomotic site / pseudoaneurysm | Re-operation or angiographic embolisation |
| ***Pancreatitis*** | | Manipulation of pancreatic remnant → inflammation | Supportive; usually mild |
| **Wound infection** | | Especially if preop biliary stenting → bile colonised with bacteria → contaminated operative field | ***The lecture slide notes: "Pre-op biliary stenting → bacterial contamination, inflammation, procedure-associated complications"*** [3] |
| **Pancreatic ascites** | | Pancreatic juice leaks into peritoneal cavity [14] | Drainage, somatostatin analogue |
| **Multi-organ failure** | | SIRS from pancreatic enzyme spillage → MOF (kidneys, lungs, bowels) | ICU support [1] |

<Callout title="The Dreaded PJ Leak Cascade" type="error">
The PJ leak is the ***most dangerous complication*** of Whipple's because it triggers a cascade: leak of pancreatic enzymes → erosion of GDA pseudoaneurysm → catastrophic haemorrhage, AND/OR → portal vein thrombosis → mesenteric ischaemia, AND/OR → pancreatic fistula → dehydration + metabolic acidosis (loss of HCO₃⁻-rich pancreatic juice). This is why ***surgeons place abdominal drains around the pancreatic and biliary anastomosis*** to monitor for leaks early [1][2].
</Callout>

> ***Somatostatin analogue (e.g. octreotide) does NOT reduce the risk of PJ leak*** — it only reduces the *volume* of output in established fistulae [2].

> ***Only proven method to reduce PJ leakage: high-volume centre with high case load*** [14].

##### Late Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Exocrine insufficiency → Malabsorption and steatorrhoea*** [1] | Loss of pancreatic head parenchyma → reduced enzyme production (though some function remains from body/tail remnant) | ***Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT)*** — e.g. Creon (pancrelipase) taken with meals |
| ***Endocrine insufficiency → DM*** | Loss of islets of Langerhans in resected head; new-onset DM in ***~16%*** [2] | OHA / insulin |
| ***Gastric stasis*** | ***Especially in PPPD*** (preserved pylorus, but loss of duodenal coordination) [1] | Prokinetics, dietary modification (small frequent meals) |
| ***Dumping syndrome*** | ***More common in classic Whipple*** (loss of pylorus → rapid gastric emptying of hyperosmolar contents into jejunum → fluid shifts → vasomotor symptoms) | Dietary modification (small meals, avoid simple sugars), rarely octreotide |
| ***Marginal ulceration*** | Mucosal erosion at the gastrojejunostomy (GJ) site — exposure of jejunal mucosa to acid without buffering by duodenal bicarbonate | PPI therapy |
| ***Bile reflux gastritis*** | Bile reflux through GJ into gastric remnant → chemical gastritis (***difficult to manage***) [2] | Sucralfate, cholestyramine; surgical revision rarely needed |
| **Tumour recurrence** | Micrometastatic disease despite R0 resection; most recurrences are distant (liver, peritoneum) | Adjuvant chemotherapy reduces risk; surveillance with CT + CA 19-9 |

***The lecture slide on tissue loss after resection explicitly notes*** [16]:

> ***"Just adequate resection → No diabetes mellitus, No steatorrhoea"***
> ***"Excessive resection → Diabetes mellitus, Steatorrhoea"***

This highlights that the extent of pancreatic resection directly determines the severity of metabolic consequences. The surgical principle is to remove enough for oncological clearance while preserving as much functional parenchyma as possible.

#### 2. Distal Pancreatectomy ± Splenectomy — Specific Complications

| Complication | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Pancreatic fistula / anastomotic leak** | ***Higher anastomotic leak rate compared to Whipple's*** [2] — the cut surface of the pancreatic body/neck is large and the stump closure is under tension |
| **Post-splenectomy complications** | ***Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI)***: lifelong risk of fulminant sepsis from encapsulated organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis) → ***vaccination required*** [2] |
| **Post-splenectomy thrombocytosis** | Loss of splenic sequestration → reactive thrombocytosis → risk of thrombosis |
| **Endocrine/exocrine insufficiency** | Variable — depends on extent of resection |

#### 3. Biliary Stent / ERCP Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Stent occlusion*** | ***Sludge, tumour ingrowth (through mesh of metallic stent), tumour overgrowth (tumour grows over ends of stent)*** [13] → recurrent jaundice. Managed by sweeping or placing new stent [14] |
| ***Stent migration*** | Stent moves distally into duodenum or proximally into bile duct [13] |
| ***Cholangitis / Cholecystitis*** | Bacterial contamination of obstructed bile; stent dysfunction → re-obstruction → cholangitis [13] |
| **Post-ERCP pancreatitis** | Traumatic instrumentation at the ampulla → papillary oedema → pancreatic duct obstruction → acute pancreatitis |
| **Perforation** | Sphincterotomy too deep, or scope-related duodenal perforation |
| **Bleeding** | Post-sphincterotomy |

***The lecture slide on preoperative biliary drainage complications notes*** [3]:

> ***"Pre-op biliary drainage has increased risk of serious complications — Pancreatitis (7%), cholangitis (26%), blocked stent (15%), bleeding (2%), perforation (2%)"***
> ***"Surgery-related complications were comparable"***
> ***"Routine pre-op biliary drainage in patients undergoing surgery for CA pancreas increases rate of complications"***

#### 4. PTBD-Specific Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Haemobilia / bleeding** | ***Puncture of hepatic artery or portal vein*** before reaching bile duct (portal triad) [13] |
| **Electrolyte / fluid loss** | External PTBD → bile output is lost externally → loss of bile salts, fluid, electrolytes (Na⁺, K⁺, HCO₃⁻) |
| **Catheter dislodgement** | Accidental removal → bile peritonitis |
| **Bacteraemia** | Needle traverses skin and liver → risk of introducing infection |

#### 5. Chemotherapy Complications

| Regimen | Key Toxicities |
|---|---|
| **FOLFIRINOX** | Myelosuppression (neutropaenia), diarrhoea, peripheral neuropathy (oxaliplatin — cumulative, dose-limiting), mucositis, fatigue. Significant toxicity — reserved for fit patients |
| **Gemcitabine** | Myelosuppression (thrombocytopaenia predominant), flu-like symptoms, hepatotoxicity, interstitial pneumonitis (rare) |
| **Capecitabine** | Hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia — capecitabine is preferentially activated in tumour tissue via thymidine phosphorylase, but also activates in palms/soles), diarrhoea, mucositis |

### C. Causes of Mortality in MBO / Pancreatic Cancer

***The lecture slide explicitly lists the three major causes of mortality*** [15]:

> ***Cause of mortality in MBO:***
> - ***Biliary sepsis***
> - ***Cancer cachexia***
> - ***Liver failure***

***And from the surgical oncology lecture*** [16]:

> ***Causes of mortality related to cancer:***
> - ***Cancer invasion of organ of origin, adjacent organs or distant sites leading to loss of organ function***
> - ***Cancer cachexia***
> - ***Examples: Oesophageal cancer, Pancreatic cancer, Liver cancer***

| Cause of Death | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Biliary sepsis*** | Biliary stasis → ascending cholangitis → overwhelming sepsis → septic shock → multi-organ failure. This is why biliary decompression (stenting/PTBD) is a priority in palliation [15] |
| ***Cancer cachexia*** | Progressive wasting driven by tumour-derived cytokines (TNF-α/cachectin, IL-6, IL-1, proteolysis-inducing factor) → loss of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue → immune dysfunction → death from infection or cardiac failure [15][16] |
| ***Liver failure*** | (1) Hepatic metastases replace functional liver parenchyma → synthetic failure, or (2) prolonged biliary obstruction → secondary biliary cirrhosis → hepatic decompensation [15] |

---

### Prognosis — Final Summary

| Scenario | Survival |
|---|---|
| ***After radical resection: 1-year*** | ***66%*** [4] |
| ***After radical resection: 5-year*** | ***27%*** [4] |
| ***Palliative bypass: 1-year*** | ***10%*** [4] |
| ***Palliative bypass: 5-year*** | ***0%*** [4] |
| Node-negative resection: 5-year | 25–30% [1] |
| Node-positive resection: 5-year | ~10% [1] |
| Unresectable locally advanced: median | 12 months [1] |
| Metastatic disease: median | 6 months [1] |
| Diagnosed at localised stage | Only 8% [1] |
| Diagnosed with distant metastases | 53% (majority) [1] |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications">

1. **Disease complications**: Acute cholangitis (biliary sepsis), acute pancreatitis, GOO, obstructive jaundice with coagulopathy/malnutrition, Trousseau syndrome (migratory thrombophlebitis), new-onset DM.

2. **Three leading causes of death in MBO**: ***Biliary sepsis, cancer cachexia, liver failure***.

3. ***PJ leak (~30%)*** is the most feared complication of Whipple's — triggers cascade of GDA pseudoaneurysm, haemorrhage, PV thrombosis, pancreatic fistula.

4. ***Pancreatic fistula definition***: Drain output after postop D3 with amylase > 3× ULN. Risk factors: high BMI, soft pancreas, narrow duct.

5. ***DGE in PPPD***: Injury to nerve of Latarjet + disrupted pacemaker cells + reduced CCK.

6. ***Only proven method to reduce PJ leak***: High-volume centre with high case load.

7. ***Preop biliary drainage increases complications***: Pancreatitis 7%, cholangitis 26%, blocked stent 15% — but practically necessary at QMH due to long surgical wait times.

8. ***Post-splenectomy***: Lifelong risk of OPSI from encapsulated organisms → vaccination essential.

9. ***Just adequate resection → no DM, no steatorrhoea; excessive resection → DM + steatorrhoea*** — balance oncological clearance with functional preservation.

10. ***Radical resection***: 1-year 66%, 5-year 27%. ***Palliative bypass***: 1-year 10%, 5-year 0%.
