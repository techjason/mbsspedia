## Differential Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer

### General Approach to the Differential

The differential diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is broad because the presenting features — epigastric pain, obstructive jaundice, weight loss, new-onset diabetes — are **non-specific** and shared by many hepatobiliary, pancreatic, and even extra-abdominal conditions [1]. The key principle taught in the lectures is:

> ***"Painless progressive obstructive jaundice in elderly is malignant biliary obstruction until proven otherwise"*** [9]

The differential should be structured around **two clinical axes**:

1. **The presenting syndrome** — Are we dealing with obstructive jaundice? Epigastric/back pain? A pancreatic mass? New-onset diabetes?
2. **The imaging appearance** — Is the pancreatic lesion **cystic** or **solid**? [1]

This dual approach is how the senior notes frame it, and it makes clinical sense: you encounter the patient first (history/exam) then refine after imaging.

### Framework 1: Differential by Presenting Syndrome

#### A. Differential Diagnosis of Painless Obstructive Jaundice

This is the most important differential list for exams. The causes can be organised by the **anatomical level of obstruction** and whether the obstruction is **intraluminal, mural, or extramural** [9][3].

***The lecture slide explicitly lists the following cancers occurring along the biliary tract*** [3][4]:

- ***Cholangiocarcinoma (intrahepatic, perihilar/Klatskin tumour, distal)***
- ***Carcinoma of the gallbladder***
- ***Carcinoma of the head of pancreas***
- ***Periampullary carcinoma (ampulla of Vater)***
- ***Carcinoma of the duodenum***
- ***Porta hepatis lymphadenopathy (metastatic)***

| Location of Obstruction | Intraluminal | Mural | Extramural |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Proximal / Hilar** | Choledocholithiasis (migrated), RPC stones | ***Cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumour)*** [3][4], PSC stricture | ***Porta hepatis lymphadenopathy*** [4], ***CA gallbladder*** invading CHD [3] |
| **Mid-CBD** | Gallstone (choledocholithiasis) | Cholangiocarcinoma (mid-duct) | Mirizzi syndrome (gallstone in cystic duct/Hartmann's pouch compressing CHD externally) |
| **Distal CBD / Periampullary** | Gallstone impacted at ampulla | ***Distal cholangiocarcinoma***, ***ampullary carcinoma*** [3][4] | ***CA head of pancreas*** [3][4], ***CA duodenum*** [3][4], ***periampullary lymphadenopathy*** |

<Callout title="How to Differentiate Stone vs. Tumour on History" type="idea">
***Stone*** = typically **episodic** pain (biliary colic), may have fever/rigors (cholangitis — Charcot's triad), **fluctuating** jaundice (stone ball-valves in and out of the ampulla), history of gallstones/biliary colic.

***Tumour*** = **painless, progressive, relentless** jaundice (gradual obstruction, no intermittent relief), **weight loss**, **palpable gallbladder** (Courvoisier's sign), constitutional symptoms [9].
</Callout>

#### B. Differential Diagnosis of Jaundice + Epigastric Mass

***The lecture slide by Prof R Poon explicitly lists the pathology producing jaundice AND epigastric mass*** [4]:

- ***Hepatomegaly secondary to biliary obstruction*** (back-pressure → enlarged, smooth liver)
- ***Hepatomegaly due to metastases or HCC*** (nodular, hard liver)
- ***Lymph node metastases to the coeliac axis or porta hepatis***
- ***Carcinoma of stomach with metastatic lymph node in the porta hepatis*** (gastric cancer → coeliac/portal LN → biliary obstruction)
- ***Distended stomach due to duodenal obstruction by tumour which also obstructs the bile duct*** (i.e., pancreatic head cancer causing both GOO and biliary obstruction simultaneously)

This is high yield because it reminds you that "jaundice + epigastric mass" is not exclusively pancreatic cancer — gastric cancer with portal lymphadenopathy, HCC, and even lymphoma can produce the same constellation.

#### C. Differential Diagnosis of Epigastric Pain Radiating to Back

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|
| **Pancreatic cancer** | Insidious onset, progressive weight loss, jaundice (if head), new-onset DM, relieved by leaning forward |
| **Chronic pancreatitis** | ***Difficult to distinguish from CA pancreas!*** [7] History of alcohol/recurrent acute pancreatitis, pancreatic calcifications on imaging, "chain of lakes" on MRCP, may have steatorrhoea triad |
| **Acute pancreatitis** | Acute onset, serum lipase/amylase > 3× ULN, obvious aetiology (gallstones, alcohol) |
| **Peptic ulcer disease (posterior DU)** | Posterior duodenal ulcer can erode into pancreas → back pain; meal-related, responds to PPI, positive H. pylori |
| **Abdominal aortic aneurysm** | Pulsatile epigastric mass, radiates to back, may be asymptomatic or present with rupture |
| **Retroperitoneal lymphoma** | Younger patient, B-symptoms, bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy on CT |

#### D. Differential of New-Onset Diabetes + Weight Loss in Elderly

| Condition | Clue |
|---|---|
| **Pancreatic cancer** | Most important to rule out; associated with obstructive jaundice, back pain |
| **Chronic pancreatitis** | Long alcohol history, pancreatic calcifications, exocrine insufficiency preceding endocrine insufficiency [7] |
| **Type 1 DM (late-onset/LADA)** | Autoantibodies (anti-GAD, anti-IA2), ketosis-prone, lean |
| **Haemochromatosis** | Bronze diabetes, liver disease, arthropathy, iron studies |

### Framework 2: Differential by Imaging Appearance of Pancreatic Mass

This is the framework explicitly provided in the senior notes [1]. When imaging shows a pancreatic mass, the first branch point is: **is it cystic or solid?**

| Imaging | Category | Differential Diagnosis | Key Differentiating Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cystic** | Inflammatory fluid collections | ***Acute peripancreatic fluid collections (APFC)*** | Context of recent acute pancreatitis; < 4 weeks |
| | | ***Pancreatic pseudocyst*** | > 4 weeks after acute pancreatitis, encapsulated, no solid component, NO epithelial lining (hence "pseudo"), amylase-rich fluid |
| | | ***Acute necrotic collections (ANC)*** / ***Walled-off necrosis (WON)*** | Necrotising pancreatitis; heterogeneous content (fluid + necrotic debris) |
| | Non-neoplastic | True cyst, retention cyst, mucinous non-neoplastic cyst, lymphoepithelial cyst | Usually incidental, no worrisome features |
| | Neoplastic | ***Serous cystic neoplasm (SCN)*** | Older women, microcystic/"honeycomb" pattern, central calcified scar, **NO malignant potential** → observe [8] |
| | | ***Mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN)*** | ***Perimenopausal women, body/tail, ovarian-type stroma***, macrocystic, **malignant potential** [8] |
| | | ***Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)*** | ***Pancreatic head in old men***; main-duct (high malignant risk → resect) vs. branch-duct (observe unless high-risk stigmata: > 4 cm, mural nodules, main duct > 10 mm) [8] |
| **Solid** | Non-neoplastic | ***Focal chronic pancreatitis*** | ***Very difficult to distinguish from pancreatic cancer!*** [7] History of alcohol, diffuse calcifications, "chain of lakes" duct, IgG4 may help |
| | | ***Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP)*** | Type 1 = IgG4-related disease (diffuse "sausage-shaped" pancreas, multifocal biliary strictures, ↑ serum IgG4, responds dramatically to steroids); Type 2 = associated with IBD. Key DDx because it mimics cancer but is treated medically! |
| | | ***Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm*** | Young women (20–30s), large well-encapsulated mass with cystic degeneration, low malignant potential, excellent prognosis after resection |
| | Neoplastic — Malignant | ***Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)*** | Hypoattenuating mass, double duct sign, vascular encasement, desmoplastic stroma |
| | | ***Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (PanNET)*** | ***Hyperenhancing (hyperdense) on arterial phase CT*** (contrast with PDAC which is hypo-attenuating!) ± calcifications, chromogranin A positive, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy positive [10] |
| | | ***Lymphoma (pancreatic)*** | Rare, bulky mass, B-symptoms, responds to chemotherapy, biopsy essential |
| | | ***Metastasis to pancreas*** | ***Most common primary: renal cell carcinoma (RCC)*** [2], also lung, breast, melanoma; usually well-circumscribed, hypervascular, history of prior malignancy |

<Callout title="PDAC vs. PanNET on CT — A Classic Distinction" type="error">
This is a common exam trap. ***PDAC appears hypoattenuating (hypodense)*** on CT because of its dense desmoplastic, hypovascular stroma. ***PanNETs appear hyperenhancing (hyperdense) on arterial phase*** because they are highly vascular. Also: PDAC = no calcifications, PanNET may have calcifications; PDAC = CA19-9 elevated, PanNET = chromogranin A elevated [10][2].
</Callout>

### Framework 3: The "Periampullary Cancer" Differential

All tumours arising within 2 cm of the ampulla of Vater are termed ***periampullary cancers***. They all present similarly (painless obstructive jaundice) and all require Whipple's procedure for curative resection, but they have **different prognoses** [2][3][4]:

| Tumour | Key Distinguishing Features | 5-Year Survival After Resection |
|---|---|---|
| ***CA head of pancreas*** | ***Dull aching pain radiating to back, new-onset DM*** [2]; hypoattenuating mass, double duct sign | ~10–25% |
| ***Distal cholangiocarcinoma*** | ***Elderly***, cholestatic LFTs, may have PSC history [2] | ~25–40% |
| ***Ampulla of Vater carcinoma*** | Jaundice (may fluctuate due to tumour necrosis — intermittent obstruction), fat malabsorption; visible on duodenoscopy [2] | ~40–60% |
| ***Periampullary duodenal carcinoma*** | ***Rare, except in FAP*** (familial adenomatous polyposis); ***Thomas' sign: silver stool*** (obstructive jaundice → white stool + tumour ulceration → melena → combined appearance) [2] | ~50–60% |

<Callout title="Thomas' Sign">
***Thomas' sign = silver stool*** — an uncommon but pathognomonic finding of periampullary duodenal carcinoma. The "silver" colour arises from the combination of **pale/clay stool** (biliary obstruction) mixed with **melaena** (GI bleeding from tumour ulceration). White + black = silver [2].
</Callout>

### The Critical Mimic: Chronic Pancreatitis vs. Pancreatic Cancer

This deserves special emphasis because ***chronic pancreatitis is notoriously difficult to distinguish from pancreatic cancer*** [7], and getting it wrong has serious consequences (unnecessary Whipple's for pancreatitis, or missed cancer treated as pancreatitis).

| Feature | Chronic Pancreatitis | Pancreatic Cancer |
|---|---|---|
| History | Long alcohol history, recurrent acute attacks | No prior pancreatic disease; smoking, new-onset DM |
| Pain pattern | Recurrent, may eventually become "burnt out" (painless) | Progressive, unrelenting |
| Calcifications | Diffuse pancreatic calcifications | Absent (usually) |
| Duct | "Chain of lakes" (diffuse alternating stricture-dilatation) | Single focal duct cutoff with upstream dilatation |
| Mass | May have focal inflammatory mass | Hypoattenuating mass with vascular encasement |
| CA 19-9 | May be mildly elevated (especially if cholangitis) | Usually markedly elevated (but not diagnostic) |
| IgG4 | Elevated in autoimmune pancreatitis (type 1) | Normal |
| Biopsy | May be needed (EUS-guided) to differentiate | Definitive; but not mandatory if resectable |

---

### The Critical Mimic: Autoimmune Pancreatitis (AIP)

Autoimmune pancreatitis is the one condition you absolutely must exclude before committing to Whipple's, because it responds to steroids. The imaging can look identical to PDAC.

| Feature | AIP Type 1 (IgG4-related) | PDAC |
|---|---|---|
| Age/Sex | Middle-aged to elderly male | Elderly, M > F |
| Pancreatic imaging | ***"Sausage-shaped" diffuse enlargement***, loss of lobularity, capsule-like rim | Focal hypoattenuating mass |
| Biliary strictures | Multifocal (intrahepatic + extrahepatic) — mimics PSC/cholangiocarcinoma | Single distal CBD stricture |
| Serum IgG4 | Elevated (> 2× ULN highly specific) | Normal |
| Other organ involvement | Salivary glands, retroperitoneum, kidneys (systemic IgG4-related disease) | None |
| Response to steroids | ***Dramatic response (diagnostic and therapeutic)*** | No response |
| EUS-FNA | Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis | Adenocarcinoma cells |

### Tumour Markers in the Differential — What They Can and Cannot Tell You

***The lecture slide provides a comprehensive table of tumour markers*** [3]:

| Marker | Upper Normal | Sensitivity in Pancreatic Cancer | Non-Malignant Causes of Elevation | Key Point |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ***AFP*** | ***10 ng/ml*** | Low (not a pancreatic marker) | ***Hepatitis, cirrhosis, biliary obstruction*** | Useful to differentiate HCC from cholangioCA/PDAC |
| ***CEA*** | ***5 ng/ml*** | ***30–70% in pancreatic cancer*** | ***Smoking, liver disease, bowel diseases, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, renal failure*** [3] | Not specific; primarily a CRC marker |
| ***CA 19-9*** | ***37 U/ml*** | ***72–79% in pancreatic cancer*** | ***Benign biliary diseases, benign pancreatic diseases*** (cholangitis, gallstones, chronic pancreatitis) [3] | ***NOT sensitive or specific enough for diagnosis***; best used for **prognosis and monitoring treatment response/recurrence** [1][2]. Requires Lewis blood group antigen expression (5–10% of population are Lewis-negative and will never elevate CA 19-9) |
| ***CA 125*** | ***35 U/ml*** | ***~60% in pancreatic cancer*** | ***Benign pancreatic and liver disease*** [3] | Primarily an ovarian cancer marker |
| ***DUPAN-2*** | ***150 U/ml*** | ***~70% in pancreatic/biliary cancer*** | ***Benign hepatobiliary diseases (hepatitis, cholelithiasis)*** [3] | Less commonly used clinically |

<Callout title="CA 19-9: Know Its Limitations" type="error">
***CA 19-9 is NOT a screening or diagnostic test for pancreatic cancer.*** It is elevated in ~75–80% of PDAC but also elevated in cholangitis, choledocholithiasis, chronic pancreatitis, and other GI malignancies. Conversely, 5–10% of the population are **Lewis antigen-negative** and will NEVER produce CA 19-9 regardless of tumour burden. Its main role is ***prognostic + monitoring treatment response and detecting recurrence after surgery*** [1][2][3].
</Callout>

### Summary: Key Differential Diagnoses by Clinical Scenario

| Clinical Scenario | Top Differentials to Consider |
|---|---|
| Painless obstructive jaundice + palpable GB | CA head of pancreas, distal cholangioCA, ampullary CA |
| Painless obstructive jaundice + hepatomegaly | HCC, liver metastases, proximal cholangioCA |
| Jaundice + epigastric mass | ***All causes listed by Prof Poon*** [4]: biliary obstruction with hepatomegaly, liver mets/HCC, coeliac/portal LN mets, gastric CA with LN mets, distended stomach from duodenal obstruction |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Differential Diagnosis">

1. **Painless progressive obstructive jaundice** in elderly = malignant biliary obstruction until proven otherwise. Top DDx: CA head of pancreas, distal cholangioCA, ampullary CA, CA duodenum.

2. **Periampullary cancers** (within 2 cm of ampulla): pancreatic head, distal CBD, ampullary, duodenal — all present with painless jaundice but have very different prognoses (ampullary best, PDAC worst).

3. ***Chronic pancreatitis is notoriously difficult to distinguish from PDAC*** — look for diffuse calcifications, chain-of-lakes duct, alcohol history; may need biopsy.

4. ***Autoimmune pancreatitis*** (IgG4-related) mimics PDAC but responds dramatically to steroids — check IgG4, look for sausage-shaped pancreas and multiorgan IgG4 disease.

5. ***PDAC = hypoattenuating on CT; PanNET = hyperenhancing on arterial phase*** — a key imaging distinction.

6. ***CA 19-9 is NOT diagnostic*** — use for prognosis and monitoring. Lewis-negative patients (5–10%) will never elevate CA 19-9.

7. ***Thomas' sign (silver stool)*** = pathognomonic of periampullary duodenal carcinoma (white stool from obstruction + melaena from tumour ulceration).

8. **Metastases to pancreas**: most commonly from **RCC**, also lung, breast, melanoma — usually well-circumscribed and hypervascular.
