## Complications of Osteomyelitis

The complications of osteomyelitis can be understood systematically by thinking about **what the infection does to bone, to adjacent structures, and to the patient systemically**. They also divide logically into **complications of the disease itself** and **complications of the treatment** (surgery and prolonged antibiotics). Let's work through each from first principles.

---

### Classification Framework

| Timing | Local Complications | Systemic Complications |
|---|---|---|
| **Early / Acute** | Subperiosteal abscess, septic arthritis, soft tissue extension, pathological fracture | Sepsis/septicaemia, bacteraemia with metastatic seeding |
| **Late / Chronic** | Chronic osteomyelitis, growth disturbance, AVN, deformity, sinus tract, squamous cell carcinoma (Marjolin's ulcer), amyloidosis | Rarely: amyloidosis |
| **Treatment-related** | Surgical wound complications, implant failure, recurrence | Antibiotic side effects, amputation complications |

### A. Complications of the Disease

#### 1. Progression to Chronic Osteomyelitis

This is the **most common complication** of inadequately treated acute osteomyelitis.

- **Why does it happen?** If acute osteomyelitis is not treated early and adequately (or if the organism is resistant), the pathological sequence runs its full course: suppuration → ↑ intraosseous pressure → bone necrosis → ***sequestrum*** formation [1][2]. Once a sequestrum is established, the disease becomes chronic because:
  - Sequestrum is avascular → antibiotics cannot reach bacteria within it
  - Sequestrum acts as a foreign body → persistent nidus of infection
  - ***Involucrum*** (new bone) forms around the dead bone but cannot eradicate the infection within it [1]
  - ***Cloacae*** (draining sinuses) develop through the involucrum → chronic discharge to the skin surface [1]
- **Clinical consequence**: ***Draining sinus tract*** [2], intermittent flare-ups of pain and fever, need for prolonged antibiotics + surgical debridement
- ***Chronic osteomyelitis on X-ray mimics malignancy*** — ***osteosclerotic lesion, wide zone of transition, periosteal reaction*** [2] → always requires careful differentiation from bone tumour

<Callout title="Key Exam Point">
***Understand the sequalae of MSS infections if not treated promptly*** [1]. The lecture slides explicitly state this as a learning outcome. Delayed or inadequate treatment of acute osteomyelitis → chronic osteomyelitis → lifelong disease requiring repeated operations.
</Callout>

#### 2. Septic Arthritis

- **Why does it happen?** Osteomyelitis in the metaphysis can spread to the adjacent joint in two scenarios:
  1. ***In infants < 1 year***: transphyseal vessels cross the growth plate → bacteria reach the epiphysis → since the epiphysis is intra-articular, infection spills into the joint [2]
  2. **At any age when the metaphysis is intracapsular**: the proximal femur, proximal humerus, and proximal radius/distal lateral humerus have their metaphyses lying within the joint capsule. Infection breaking through the cortex enters the joint directly
- **Clinical consequence**: Acute hot swollen joint with severe pain on movement; ***joint aspiration: Gram stain, culture, crystal, glucose*** [1]; if untreated → rapid cartilage destruction (cartilage is avascular and exquisitely sensitive to bacterial enzymes and the acidic environment of pus) → secondary osteoarthritis
- ***MRI is useful to detect any co-existent osteomyelitis*** [1] in the setting of septic arthritis — always look for it

> **Why is septic arthritis a surgical emergency?** Articular cartilage has no blood supply — it relies on diffusion from synovial fluid for nutrition. Pus replaces synovial fluid → (1) enzymatic destruction of collagen by bacterial proteases and neutrophil-released MMPs, (2) acidic pH from anaerobic metabolism → chondrocyte death, (3) increased intra-articular pressure → cartilage ischaemia. Irreversible cartilage damage begins within **6–8 hours**. This is why ***empirical antibiotics and early surgical intervention are necessary in case of life-threatening conditions such as septic arthritis*** [1].

#### 3. Pathological Fracture

- **Why does it happen?** Osteomyelitis causes osteolysis (bone destruction by inflammatory mediators, osteoclast activation by IL-1, TNF-α, RANKL). The cortex is weakened by:
  - Intramedullary abscess eroding from within
  - Cortical perforation (cloacae)
  - Periosteal stripping → loss of periosteal blood supply → cortical devascularisation
- When the bone is sufficiently weakened, it can fracture with minimal or no trauma = **pathological fracture**
- **Management**: Stabilise the fracture (external fixation preferred — avoids introducing more internal hardware into infected bone) + treat the underlying osteomyelitis

#### 4. Growth Disturbance (Children)

- **Why does it happen?** The growth plate (physis) is the engine of longitudinal bone growth. Osteomyelitis can damage the physis in several ways:
  - Direct infection of the growth plate (especially in infants where transphyseal vessels carry bacteria to the epiphysis)
  - Ischaemia from raised intraosseous pressure and periosteal stripping disrupts the blood supply to the germinal zone of the physis
  - Inflammatory mediators directly damage chondrocytes in the proliferative zone
- **Clinical consequences**:
  - **Limb length discrepancy** (LLD): premature physeal closure → shortened limb compared to the contralateral side
  - **Angular deformity**: partial physeal damage → asymmetric growth → varus or valgus deformity
  - **Joint incongruity**: if the epiphysis is damaged → irregular articular surface → early secondary osteoarthritis
- More common in younger children (more growth remaining) and in infections involving the physis directly

#### 5. Avascular Necrosis (AVN)

- **Why does it happen?** Osteomyelitis is listed as a cause of AVN [4]:
  - Raised intraosseous pressure compresses endosteal vessels
  - Periosteal stripping removes the outer cortical blood supply
  - Thrombosis of vessels due to septic emboli and inflammation
  - Result: complete loss of blood supply to a segment of bone → cellular death of bone components = ***AVN***
- Most relevant in the **proximal femur** (hip) — the femoral head has a precarious blood supply at baseline (retinacular vessels of the medial femoral circumflex artery are the main supply and are easily disrupted)
- **Clinical features of AVN**: ***insidious onset of hip pain, limited ROM especially abduction and internal rotation*** [4]
- **Investigations**: MRI is the most sensitive — ***double line sign*** on T2W [4]; X-ray shows ***crescent sign*** (subchondral collapse) [4]

#### 6. Sepsis / Septicaemia

- **Why does it happen?** Acute osteomyelitis, being a haematogenous infection or at least involving richly vascularised bone, can lead to sustained bacteraemia → systemic inflammatory response → sepsis → septic shock → multi-organ failure
- Particular risk in:
  - Neonates and infants (immature immune system)
  - Immunocompromised patients (DM, steroids, malignancy)
  - Delayed diagnosis
- **Clinical features**: High fever, rigors, tachycardia, hypotension, altered mental status, organ dysfunction (AKI, ARDS, DIC)
- ***Severity from mild to life threatening*** [1]; ***early recognition and high suspicion are important if life-threatening infections*** [1]

#### 7. Metastatic Infection

- **Why does it happen?** Sustained bacteraemia from the bone focus can seed other organs:
  - **Endocarditis**: bacteria settle on heart valves (especially if pre-existing valvular disease) → S. aureus is the most common cause of acute infective endocarditis
  - **Septic emboli**: from endocarditis or directly from the bone focus → pulmonary septic emboli (lung abscesses), splenic abscess, brain abscess
  - **Other bones**: haematogenous seeding of infection to additional skeletal sites (multifocal osteomyelitis — more common in neonates, up to 40%)
- This is why blood cultures are essential — they not only identify the organism but alert you to the risk of metastatic seeding

#### 8. Epidural Abscess (Vertebral Osteomyelitis)

- **Why does it happen?** Infection in the vertebral body can extend posteriorly into the epidural space → collection of pus compresses the spinal cord or cauda equina
- **Clinical triad**: Back pain + fever + progressive neurological deficit (weakness, sensory loss, bowel/bladder dysfunction)
- **This is a neurosurgical/orthopaedic emergency** — ***from adjacent foci: osteomyelitis → epidural abscess → IV antibiotics + surgical drainage/debridement*** [12]
- Without emergency decompression, irreversible spinal cord damage occurs → paraplegia
- ***The lecture slides on paraplegia list osteomyelitis as an infective cause of spinal cord compression*** [12], specifically through epidural abscess formation

<Callout title="Epidural Abscess — Never Miss This" type="error">
Any patient with vertebral osteomyelitis who develops new neurological symptoms (leg weakness, urinary retention, saddle anaesthesia) must have **emergency MRI spine** and **urgent surgical decompression**. Delay of even hours can mean the difference between recovery and permanent paraplegia. This is a classic exam scenario.
</Callout>

#### 9. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (Marjolin's Ulcer)

- **Why does it happen?** Long-standing chronic osteomyelitis with a draining sinus tract creates a state of **chronic inflammation → chronic tissue repair → repeated epithelial turnover** at the sinus opening. Over years to decades, this repeated cellular proliferation increases the risk of malignant transformation
- "Marjolin's ulcer" = squamous cell carcinoma arising in a chronically inflamed scar, wound, or sinus tract
- **Timeframe**: typically develops after **20–30 years** of chronic draining sinus
- **Clinical clue**: change in the character of the discharge (bloody rather than purulent), increase in pain, new mass at the sinus site, rapidly enlarging ulcer with raised/rolled edges
- **Management**: biopsy of suspicious sinus tract → if SCC confirmed → wide excision ± amputation

#### 10. Secondary Amyloidosis (AA Amyloidosis)

- **Why does it happen?** Chronic inflammation (from any cause, including chronic osteomyelitis) → persistent elevation of serum amyloid A (SAA) protein (an acute-phase reactant produced by the liver in response to IL-6) → over months to years, SAA is deposited as insoluble amyloid fibrils in organs
- **Organs affected**: kidneys (nephrotic syndrome — most common presentation), liver (hepatomegaly), spleen
- **Historical significance**: This was a major cause of renal failure before the era of effective antibiotics. Now rare in developed countries due to earlier and more effective treatment of osteomyelitis
- Still relevant in settings where chronic osteomyelitis persists for years without adequate treatment

#### 11. Joint Stiffness and Contracture

- **Why does it happen?** Prolonged immobilisation (splinting/casting during treatment) + periarticular inflammation → soft tissue fibrosis → adhesions around tendons and joint capsule → reduced ROM
- Particularly problematic in children who may develop **Volkmann's contracture** if the infection causes compartment syndrome (forearm) [13]
- **Prevention**: early physiotherapy, judicious immobilisation, early weight-bearing when safe

### B. Complications of Treatment

#### 1. Surgical Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Wound infection / dehiscence** | Operating on already infected tissue → high risk of wound breakdown; poor local blood supply (especially tibia) |
| **Non-union / delayed union** | Extensive debridement removes bone stock and periosteum; infection itself impairs osteogenesis |
| **Recurrence of infection** | Incomplete debridement leaving residual sequestrum or biofilm; inadequate antibiotic duration |
| **Neurovascular injury** | Intraoperative damage during debridement near neurovascular structures |
| **Fracture after debridement** | Bone weakened by sequestrectomy → pathological fracture; why ***stabilisation — ORIF, external fixation (Ilizarov)*** [1] is part of the Cierny-Mader Stage III/IV algorithm |

#### 2. Amputation-Related Complications [11][13]

When osteomyelitis necessitates amputation, the complications are:

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Early** | ***Bleeding and haematoma formation*** | Surgical site haemorrhage |
| | ***Wound infection*** | Operating through potentially contaminated field |
| | ***Phantom limb pain*** | Central and peripheral nerve reorganisation after limb loss; the brain still "maps" the missing limb |
| | ***Skin necrosis*** | Poor perfusion to the stump (especially in patients with PVD/DM) |
| **Late** | ***Stump ulceration*** | Pressure from prosthesis on poorly vascularised skin |
| | ***Stump neuroma*** | Cut nerve endings form a disorganised tangle of axons (neuroma) at the stump → painful |
| | ***Osteomyelitis*** (of the stump) | Recurrence of infection in the remaining bone — a devastating irony |
| | ***Osteophytes formation in underlying bone*** | New bone spurs at the cut bone edge → irritation of overlying soft tissue → pain and prosthesis fitting problems |
| | ***Fixed flexion deformity*** | If the joint proximal to the amputation is not kept in extension post-operatively, flexor muscles shorten → flexion contracture → cannot fit prosthesis properly |
| | ***Difficult mobilisation*** | Energy expenditure increases dramatically: ***BKA unilateral = ↑40%; AKA unilateral = ↑100%*** [11] |

***HK data: radical debridements (amputations and disarticulations) were performed in 46% of 24 patients with severe MSS infections; mortality ranges from 20 to 75%*** [1] — underscoring the devastating consequences of delayed treatment.

#### 3. Antibiotic-Related Complications

| Antibiotic | Complication | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Prolonged IV access** | Line sepsis, thrombophlebitis | Central or peripheral IV lines in situ for weeks → bacterial colonisation; endothelial inflammation |
| **Vancomycin** | Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, "Red Man syndrome" | Direct tubular toxicity (nephro); vestibular/cochlear hair cell damage (oto); histamine release if infused too fast (Red Man — not a true allergy) |
| **Cloxacillin/Flucloxacillin** | Hepatotoxicity (cholestatic), interstitial nephritis | Idiosyncratic reaction; more common in elderly, prolonged use, pre-existing liver disease |
| **Rifampicin** | Hepatotoxicity, drug interactions (CYP450 inducer), orange discoloration of body fluids | Potent CYP450 inducer reduces levels of warfarin, OCP, calcineurin inhibitors |
| **Linezolid** | Myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia, anaemia), peripheral neuropathy, lactic acidosis, serotonin syndrome | Mitochondrial toxicity with prolonged use; weak MAO-I activity |
| **Aminoglycosides** | Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity | Accumulation in proximal tubular cells and cochlear/vestibular hair cells; requires TDM |
| **Fluoroquinolones** | Tendon rupture, C. difficile colitis, QT prolongation | Disruption of collagen synthesis in tendons; disruption of gut microbiome |
| **C. difficile colitis** (any prolonged antibiotic) | Pseudomembranous colitis | Antibiotic-induced disruption of normal gut flora → C. difficile overgrowth → toxin production → mucosal damage |

### C. Complications by Specific Clinical Setting

#### Vertebral Osteomyelitis
- **Epidural abscess** → spinal cord compression → paraplegia (surgical emergency) [12]
- **Spinal instability** → kyphotic deformity (especially TB: gibbus deformity)
- **Psoas abscess** (especially TB) → palpable inguinal mass, hip flexion posture

#### Diabetic Foot Osteomyelitis
- **Progressive tissue loss** → gangrene → amputation [3]
- **Recurrence** — extremely high recurrence rate in diabetic patients due to ongoing neuropathy, vascular disease, and difficulty achieving adequate antibiotic levels in ischaemic tissue

#### Implant-Related Osteomyelitis
- ***Persistent drainage*** — as illustrated in the lecture slides: ***35-year-old diabetic, 3 months prior had had nailing for closed midshaft tibial fracture, now presents with persistent drainage*** [1]
- **Implant loosening** → fracture instability → non-union
- **Biofilm persistence** → chronic relapsing infection → may ultimately require implant removal ± staged reconstruction
