## Differential Diagnosis of Osteomyelitis

The differential diagnosis of osteomyelitis is one of those clinical exercises where context is everything — the age of the patient, the bone involved, the acuity of presentation, and the radiological appearance all dramatically narrow the list. The challenge is that osteomyelitis is a **great mimicker**: acutely it can look like cellulitis, septic arthritis, or even a fracture; chronically it can look like a bone tumour. Let's work through this systematically.

### Guiding Principle: Why is the DDx Difficult?

Osteomyelitis shares features with many conditions because:
1. **Bone pain + fever** = any bone/joint infection, inflammatory arthritis, or malignancy
2. **Radiographic periosteal reaction, osteolysis, and sclerosis** = seen in both infection and tumour
3. ***Chronic osteomyelitis on X-ray can mimic malignancy*** — ***osteosclerotic lesion, wide zone of transition, periosteal reaction*** [2] — these features overlap with aggressive bone tumours (Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma)
4. Conversely, some tumours (particularly Ewing sarcoma) present with fever, elevated ESR/CRP, and a destructive bone lesion → initially misdiagnosed as osteomyelitis

<Callout title="The Golden Rule" type="error">
Never assume a destructive bone lesion in a child or young adult is "just osteomyelitis" without considering malignancy. Conversely, never biopsy a suspected tumour through an infected field. If in doubt, **MRI + biopsy** (in a tumour-safe manner) is mandatory. ***DDx of a bone lesion on X-ray includes chronic osteomyelitis and eosinophilic granuloma*** [2].

### Detailed Differential Diagnosis by Clinical Scenario

#### A. Acute Bone Pain + Fever in a Child

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Mimics Osteomyelitis |
|---|---|---|
| ***Septic arthritis*** | ***Pain with movement, monoarthritis*** [2]; joint effusion; inability to weight-bear; joint aspiration is diagnostic (WCC > 50,000, > 75% PMN, positive Gram stain) [1] | Both cause fever + limb pain + refusal to use limb. Metaphyseal osteomyelitis can co-exist with septic arthritis (especially hip in infants where metaphysis is intracapsular) |
| **Cellulitis / Soft tissue abscess** | Superficial warmth, erythema, swelling; no deep bone tenderness; no periosteal reaction on X-ray; MRI shows soft tissue inflammation without marrow oedema | Overlying soft tissue inflammation in osteomyelitis can look identical clinically |
| **Acute rheumatic fever** | Migratory polyarthritis (not fixed to one bone); history of recent streptococcal pharyngitis; elevated ASO titre; Jones criteria | Both present with fever + joint/bone pain in children |
| **Sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis** | Known sickle cell disease; painful bone crisis can mimic osteomyelitis almost perfectly; may have identical imaging. Distinguish by clinical context, blood cultures, bone marrow aspiration | Bone infarcts in sickle cell can cause fever, bone pain, periosteal reaction. Remember: **Salmonella osteomyelitis is disproportionately common in sickle cell** [2] — so both conditions can co-exist |
| **Fracture / Non-accidental injury (NAI)** | History of trauma (or inconsistent history suggesting NAI); X-ray shows fracture line; no systemic inflammatory response unless secondary infection | Both cause localised bone pain and refusal to weight-bear |
| **Malignancy (Ewing sarcoma, leukaemia, neuroblastoma metastasis)** | Ewing sarcoma: ***onion-skin periosteal reaction (lamellated)*** [2], diaphyseal, age 5–25; leukaemia: pancytopenia, blast cells on film; neuroblastoma met: age < 5, adrenal mass | Ewing sarcoma classically presents with fever + bone pain + elevated ESR/WCC + aggressive periosteal reaction → can be indistinguishable from osteomyelitis clinically and radiologically |
| **Transient synovitis** | Commonest cause of acute hip pain in children (age 3–10); low-grade or no fever; near-normal bloods; joint effusion but non-toxic; resolves spontaneously | Both cause hip pain and limp; differentiate from septic arthritis using **Kocher criteria** (fever > 38.5°C, non-weight-bearing, ESR > 40, WCC > 12,000) |

<Callout title="Ewing Sarcoma vs Osteomyelitis — Exam Favourite" type="error">
Both can present in a young patient with bone pain, fever, elevated ESR and WCC, and an aggressive-looking bone lesion with periosteal reaction. ***Lamellated (onion skin) periosteal reaction*** is seen in both! ***Spiculated (sunburst) periosteal reaction and Codman's triangle*** suggest a very aggressive tumour [2]. When in doubt, **biopsy before antibiotics** if tumour is suspected — but **never biopsy through potentially infected tissue** (seeds tumour/infection along the tract).
</Callout>

#### B. Acute Bone/Joint Pain in an Adult

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Mimics Osteomyelitis |
|---|---|---|
| **Septic arthritis** | Acute hot swollen joint; ***joint aspiration: WCC > 50,000, > 75% PMN, positive Gram stain*** [1]; most commonly knee or hip; ***organisms: S. aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (STD)*** [2] | Can co-exist with osteomyelitis; both cause periarticular pain and systemic sepsis |
| **Crystal arthropathy (gout/pseudogout)** | Acute monoarthritis; ***joint aspiration with microscopy to rule out gout*** [2] — negatively birefringent urate crystals (gout) or positively birefringent calcium pyrophosphate (pseudogout); no organisms on culture | Both present as acute hot swollen joint; gout can cause fever and elevated WCC |
| **Cellulitis / Deep soft tissue abscess** | No marrow oedema on MRI; responds to antibiotics without bone debridement; superficial process | Can overlie and be secondary to underlying osteomyelitis |
| **Vertebral osteomyelitis DDx**: ***Disc herniation, metastasis, TB spine*** | Disc herniation: radiculopathy without fever/systemic signs; metastasis: known primary (lung, breast, prostate), lytic/blastic lesions above T5; ***TB spine: insidious, disc space relatively spared, thoracic level*** [2] | All present with back pain; vertebral osteomyelitis is insidious and can mimic all of these |
| **Diabetic foot: soft tissue infection without bone involvement** | Probe-to-bone test negative; MRI shows soft tissue inflammation but no marrow signal changes; no cortical erosion on X-ray | Diabetic foot infections commonly progress to osteomyelitis — the distinction is critical for management (antibiotics alone vs. surgery) |
| ***Charcot arthropathy (neuropathic arthropathy)*** | ***Painless*** foot and ankle deformities with warmth, redness, and oedema; DM neuropathy; ***X-ray: degenerative changes, subluxation*** [3]; joint aspiration to rule out infection | Can look identical to osteomyelitis on MRI (marrow oedema, soft tissue swelling, joint destruction); classically **painless** (vs. osteomyelitis which is painful) — but neuropathic patients may not feel pain from osteomyelitis either |
| ***Avascular necrosis (AVN)*** | ***Insidious onset of hip pain; limited ROM (abduction and internal rotation)***; risk factors: steroid use, alcohol, SLE, ***osteomyelitis itself*** [4]; MRI: ***double line sign*** on T2W [4] | Both cause bone pain with limited ROM; AVN can be a complication of osteomyelitis |

<Callout title="Charcot vs Osteomyelitis in Diabetic Foot — The Classic Dilemma" type="idea">
Both cause a warm, swollen, deformed foot with abnormal MRI signal. Key differentiators: Charcot is classically **painless** (neuropathic) whereas osteomyelitis is painful; Charcot shows **joint destruction and subluxation without cortical erosion or sinus tract**; osteomyelitis shows **cortical destruction, marrow oedema crossing the cortex, and often a sinus tract**. **Probe-to-bone test** (if a sterile metal probe can touch bone through a diabetic foot ulcer) has ~90% positive predictive value for osteomyelitis. When in doubt, **bone biopsy with culture** is the gold standard.
</Callout>

#### C. Chronic Bone Lesion on Imaging

This is where the overlap with malignancy is most problematic. ***Chronic osteomyelitis on X-ray can mimic cancer*** [2]:

| Feature | Chronic Osteomyelitis | Bone Malignancy |
|---|---|---|
| ***Osteosclerosis*** | Present (involucrum, reactive bone) | Present (osteosarcoma: cloud-like osteoid matrix; osteoblastic metastases) |
| ***Wide zone of transition*** | Can be present | Hallmark of aggressive lesion |
| ***Periosteal reaction*** | Solid or lamellated (onion skin) | ***Lamellated (Ewing), spiculated/sunburst (osteosarcoma), Codman's triangle (very aggressive)*** [2] |
| Cortical destruction | Present in advanced cases | Present |
| Soft tissue mass | Abscess / sinus tract | Tumour mass |
| Sequestrum | **Pathognomonic of osteomyelitis** — dead bone within a cavity | Absent (bone fragments in tumour are tumour matrix, not sequestra) |
| Clinical context | History of previous infection/surgery/trauma; draining sinus | Night pain, weight loss, no infective history |

| Chronic Bone Lesion DDx | Key Distinguishing Feature |
|---|---|
| **Ewing sarcoma** | Age 5–25; diaphyseal; ***onion skin periosteal reaction***; systemic symptoms; biopsy: small round blue cells |
| **Osteosarcoma** | Age 10–25; metaphyseal (around the knee); ***sunburst periosteal reaction, Codman's triangle***; elevated ALP; biopsy: malignant osteoid |
| ***Eosinophilic granuloma (Langerhans cell histiocytosis)*** [2] | Children/young adults; well-defined lytic "punched out" lesion; skull, femur, pelvis; can have periosteal reaction; biopsy: Birbeck granules, CD1a+ cells |
| **Metastatic bone disease** | Age > 40; multiple lesions; known primary (lung, breast, prostate, renal, thyroid); lytic or blastic; above T5 is suspicious |
| **Bone lymphoma** | Permeative destruction; can present with soft tissue mass; older adults; biopsy diagnostic |
| **Stress fracture** | History of repetitive activity; localised tenderness; X-ray may show periosteal reaction or fracture line; MRI: marrow oedema along fracture plane without abscess |
| ***Brodie's abscess (subacute osteomyelitis)*** | Well-defined lytic lesion with sclerotic rim in the metaphysis; mild inflammatory markers; must distinguish from osteoid osteoma (which also has a lucent nidus with sclerotic rim but has classic nocturnal pain relieved by NSAIDs) |

#### D. Vertebral Osteomyelitis — Specific DDx

***The differential diagnosis of back pain*** includes [5]:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| ***Mechanical (97%)*** | ***Back sprain ( > 70%), lumbar disc degeneration, lumbar disc herniation, spondylolisthesis, fracture (vertebral body, spondylolysis)*** |
| ***Non-mechanical (3%)*** | ***Neoplasia, inflammatory arthritis (AS/spondyloarthropathy), infection (osteomyelitis, TB spine, epidural abscess)*** |
| ***Non-spinal diseases*** | ***Pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, aortic aneurysm*** |

Key points for vertebral osteomyelitis DDx [6]:
- **Spinal metastasis**: often above T5 (vs. pyogenic osteomyelitis more common in lumbar); multiple levels; known primary cancer; **does not typically cross the disc space** early (unlike pyogenic infection which destroys the disc early)
- ***TB spine (Pott's disease)***: ***insidious, disc space relatively spared, thoracic level, cold abscess tracking along psoas*** [2]
- **Epidural abscess**: severe back pain + fever + rapidly progressive neurological deficit → surgical emergency
- **Degenerative disc disease (Modic changes on MRI)**: Modic type 1 changes (marrow oedema adjacent to endplates) can look very similar to discitis/osteomyelitis on MRI; however, no fever, no elevated inflammatory markers, no enhancement pattern typical of infection

<Callout title="Red Flags for Spinal Infection" type="idea">
In the context of back pain, ***red flags for infection*** include [6]: ***fever, immunosuppression*** (DM, steroid use, HIV), recent bacteraemia, IV drug use, recent spinal procedure, and progressive neurological deficit. These should trigger urgent MRI and blood cultures.
</Callout>

### Summary Table: Key Differentiating Features

| Feature | Osteomyelitis | Septic Arthritis | Bone Tumour | Cellulitis | Charcot |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Site of max tenderness** | Over bone (metaphysis/diaphysis) | Over joint line | Over bone | Diffuse soft tissue | Over joint/midfoot |
| **ROM** | Limited by pain | Markedly limited in all directions | May be preserved early | Preserved | Preserved (painless) |
| **Fever** | Usually present (acute) | Usually present | Variable (Ewing: yes) | Usually present | Usually absent |
| **X-ray (acute)** | Normal for 10–14 days | Joint effusion, periarticular osteopenia | Lytic/blastic lesion, periosteal reaction | Normal or soft tissue swelling | Degenerative changes |
| **MRI** | Marrow oedema, periosteal enhancement, ± abscess | Joint effusion, synovial enhancement | Marrow-replacing mass, soft tissue component | Soft tissue oedema only | Marrow oedema, joint destruction, subluxation |
| **Blood cultures** | Positive in ~50% [2] | Positive in ~50% | Negative | Usually negative | Negative |
| **Joint aspiration** | N/A (unless co-existent septic arthritis) | ***WCC > 50,000, > 75% PMN, + Gram stain*** [1] | N/A | N/A | Non-inflammatory fluid; rule out infection |
| **Key distinguishing test** | MRI + bone biopsy with culture | Joint aspiration | Biopsy (image-guided) | Clinical diagnosis | Probe-to-bone test negative; aspiration sterile |

### Age-Based Differential for Bone Pain (Paediatric Focus) [7]

This is a frequently tested framework:

| Age | Key Differentials |
|---|---|
| **< 4 years** | Transient synovitis, ***osteomyelitis, septic arthritis***, NAI |
| **4–10 years** | Transient synovitis, ***Perthes disease***, ***osteomyelitis/septic arthritis*** |
| **10–16 years** | ***SCFE***, avulsion fracture, ***osteomyelitis/septic arthritis***, ***malignancy (osteosarcoma, Ewing's)*** |

> Why does Perthes disease mimic osteomyelitis? Both cause hip pain and limited ROM (especially internal rotation and abduction) in a child. Perthes is **avascular necrosis** of the proximal femoral epiphysis — X-ray shows flattening, sclerosis, fragmentation of the femoral head rather than metaphyseal destruction. No fever or elevated inflammatory markers in Perthes.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary – Differential Diagnosis of Osteomyelitis">

1. **Acute in children**: Septic arthritis (co-exists!), cellulitis, Ewing sarcoma (the great mimicker — both cause fever, bone pain, elevated ESR, aggressive periosteal reaction), transient synovitis, sickle cell crisis, fracture/NAI

2. **Acute in adults**: Septic arthritis, crystal arthropathy (gout — always aspirate joint), cellulitis, vertebral: metastasis/TB/disc herniation

3. **Chronic bone lesion**: ***Chronic osteomyelitis can mimic cancer on X-ray*** [2] — osteosclerosis, wide zone of transition, periosteal reaction. DDx: Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, eosinophilic granuloma, metastasis, bone lymphoma. **Sequestrum is pathognomonic of chronic osteomyelitis** (not seen in tumours)

4. **Vertebral**: ***Pyogenic vs TB spine*** [2] — Pyogenic = acute, disc narrowing, lumbar; TB = insidious, disc spared, thoracic. Also DDx metastasis (above T5, no disc involvement), degenerative Modic changes

5. **Diabetic foot**: Osteomyelitis vs Charcot arthropathy — Charcot is painless, no cortical erosion, no sinus. Probe-to-bone test + bone biopsy with culture differentiates

6. ***Eosinophilic granuloma*** [2] is a frequently forgotten DDx of a lytic bone lesion with periosteal reaction in children
</Callout>
