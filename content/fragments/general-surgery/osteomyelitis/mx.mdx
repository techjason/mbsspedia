## Management of Osteomyelitis

### Overarching Principles

The management of osteomyelitis rests on two pillars — and you need to understand **why** both are necessary:

1. **Antibiotics** — to kill the bacteria
2. **Surgery** — to remove what antibiotics cannot reach (dead bone, abscesses, biofilm on implants)

Why can't antibiotics alone cure all osteomyelitis? Because:
- **Sequestrum** is avascular dead bone → no blood flow → antibiotics delivered intravenously simply cannot reach bacteria hiding in the lacunae of dead bone
- **Biofilm** on implants creates a polysaccharide shield that requires 100–1000x higher antibiotic concentrations to penetrate
- **Abscesses** are walled-off collections of pus → poor antibiotic penetration through the abscess wall; the acidic, anaerobic environment within also inactivates many antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides are less effective at low pH)

Therefore: ***Antibiotics treat the living infected tissue. Surgery removes what is dead.*** Both together are needed for cure in most cases beyond the earliest acute stages.

<Callout title="Key Management Principle from Lecture Slides">
***Acute vs Chronic management differs fundamentally*** [1]:
- ***Acute: Antibiotics – broad spectrum. Surgery only when: failed medical treatment or abscess formation***
- ***Chronic: Debridement if sequestrum present, abscess formation, failed medical treatment + Antibiotic***

In other words: acute osteomyelitis → antibiotics first, surgery if needed. Chronic osteomyelitis → surgery is almost always needed alongside antibiotics.

### 1. Medical Management — Antibiotics

#### 1a. General Principles

| Principle | Detail | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| ***Start with IV antibiotics*** [1] | High-dose intravenous route initially | Bone has relatively poor blood supply compared to soft tissues; IV dosing achieves higher peak serum and tissue levels → better bone penetration |
| **Empirical → Targeted** | Start empirical broad-spectrum before culture results; narrow once culture and sensitivity (C/ST) are available | You cannot wait 48–72 hours for culture results while the infection progresses; empirical therapy covers the most likely organisms |
| ***Monitor clinical signs such as pain, swelling, range of motion*** [1] | Serial clinical assessment | Improving pain, reducing swelling, and improving ROM indicate treatment response |
| ***Monitor biochemical markers including ESR, CRP*** [1] | Serial bloods (CRP every 2–3 days initially; ESR weekly) | CRP is the earliest marker to respond to effective treatment (falls within 48–72h). ESR used for long-term monitoring |
| ***Change to oral form if showing improvement*** [1] | Switch from IV to oral (PO) when: (1) clinically improving, (2) CRP trending down, (3) tolerating oral intake, (4) reliable patient | Oral antibiotics with good bioavailability (e.g., fluoroquinolones, rifampicin, linezolid, clindamycin) achieve adequate bone concentrations. IV-to-oral switch reduces hospital stay, cost, and IV line complications (thrombophlebitis, line sepsis) |
| ***Total 6–8 weeks, depends on clinical condition*** [1] | Total duration of antibiotic therapy | Why so long? Bone turns over slowly. Bacteria within the Haversian and Volkmann canal systems require sustained antibiotic levels for weeks to be eradicated. Short courses → high relapse rates |

<Callout title="Duration of Antibiotics — Exam Key Point">
***Total 6–8 weeks, depends on clinical condition*** [1]. The senior notes state ***IV cloxacillin x 4–6 weeks*** [2]. In practice:
- **Acute uncomplicated**: 4–6 weeks total (may switch to oral after 1–2 weeks of IV)
- **Chronic / post-surgical**: 6–8 weeks post-debridement (longer if residual infected bone)
- **Vertebral osteomyelitis**: 6–8 weeks (IDSA guidelines support 6 weeks minimum)
- **Children**: often shorter total duration (3–4 weeks) with early switch to oral (after 3–5 days IV) if clinically improving and organism is sensitive — paediatric bone heals faster and children respond better
</Callout>

#### 1b. Empirical Antibiotic Choices

| Clinical Scenario | Most Likely Organism | Empirical Antibiotic | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Acute haematogenous (child or adult)** | S. aureus, Group A Strep | ***IV cloxacillin*** [2] (or flucloxacillin/nafcillin) = anti-staphylococcal penicillin | "Clox" = cloxacillin; the "cl" reminds you it is **resistant to beta-lactamase** produced by S. aureus (unlike plain penicillin). First-line for MSSA osteomyelitis |
| ***Empirical covering Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species*** [1] | S. aureus, Streptococcus spp. | IV cloxacillin or 1st generation cephalosporin (cefazolin) | Both cover MSSA and Strep effectively; cefazolin has excellent bone penetration |
| **Suspected MRSA** | MRSA | IV vancomycin (or teicoplanin) | Vancomycin is the standard anti-MRSA agent; requires therapeutic drug monitoring (trough levels 15–20 mg/L for serious infections) |
| ***Immunocompromised patients: should cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes*** [1] | Polymicrobial including Gram-negatives, anaerobes | Add IV ceftriaxone or piperacillin-tazobactam or carbapenem (meropenem) to anti-staphylococcal cover | Immunocompromised patients have broader range of potential organisms; empirical cover must be wider |
| **Sickle cell disease** | Salmonella, S. aureus | IV ceftriaxone (covers Salmonella and S. aureus) + cloxacillin | Salmonella is disproportionately common but S. aureus is still the most frequent overall |
| **Post-traumatic / open fracture** | S. aureus, Gram-negatives, anaerobes (if soil contamination) | 1st gen cephalosporin ± aminoglycoside ± metronidazole (depending on Gustilo-Anderson grade) [10] | Grade I: 1st gen cephalosporin; Grade II: add aminoglycoside; Grade III: add metronidazole for anaerobes if farm/soil contamination |
| **Prosthetic joint / implant-related** | S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staph (biofilm), Gram-negatives | IV vancomycin + ceftriaxone (or meropenem) empirically; narrow based on deep cultures | Must cover both MRSA and Gram-negatives empirically until cultures guide therapy |
| **Diabetic foot osteomyelitis** | Polymicrobial: S. aureus, Strep, enterococci, Gram-negatives, anaerobes | Broad-spectrum: IV piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate + vancomycin (if MRSA risk) | Diabetic foot infections are almost always polymicrobial; bone biopsy culture is the gold standard to guide therapy |
| **TB osteomyelitis** | Mycobacterium tuberculosis | Standard anti-TB quadruple therapy: RIPE (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol) × 2 months, then Rifampicin + Isoniazid × 7–10 months (total 9–12 months) | TB requires prolonged multi-drug therapy because of slow-growing intracellular organisms; single-agent therapy leads to resistance |

#### 1c. Targeted Antibiotics (Once Culture Available)

| Organism | Preferred Antibiotic | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **MSSA** | ***IV cloxacillin*** [2] (or flucloxacillin) → switch to oral flucloxacillin or ciprofloxacin + rifampicin | Rifampicin has excellent bone penetration and anti-biofilm activity — always use in combination (never monotherapy → rapid resistance) |
| **MRSA** | IV vancomycin → switch to oral linezolid, TMP-SMX, or doxycycline (based on sensitivity) | Linezolid: "line-zolid" = oxazolidinone; excellent oral bioavailability and bone penetration; limit to < 4 weeks due to myelosuppression risk |
| **Streptococcus** | IV penicillin G or ampicillin | Streptococci remain penicillin-sensitive in the vast majority of cases |
| **Gram-negatives** | Based on C/ST: ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, meropenem | Fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin) have excellent oral bioavailability and bone penetration — useful for oral switch |
| **Anaerobes** | Metronidazole or clindamycin | Metronidazole: "metro-nida-zole" = works by disrupting DNA of anaerobic organisms (requires anaerobic reduction to become active → selective for anaerobes) |

<Callout title="Rifampicin — The Anti-Biofilm Agent" type="idea">
Rifampicin has a unique ability to penetrate biofilm and kill sessile (dormant, biofilm-embedded) bacteria. This makes it invaluable in implant-related osteomyelitis. **However**: (1) Never use as monotherapy — resistance develops within days. (2) Always combine with another active agent. (3) Potent CYP450 inducer — many drug interactions (warfarin, OCP, calcineurin inhibitors).

### 2. Surgical Management

#### 2a. Indications for Surgery

***Acute osteomyelitis — Surgery when:*** [1]
- ***Failed medical treatment*** (no clinical or biochemical improvement after 48–72h of appropriate IV antibiotics)
- ***Abscess formation*** (subperiosteal abscess, intraosseous abscess, soft tissue abscess)

***Chronic osteomyelitis — Surgery almost always required:*** [1]
- ***Debridement if sequestrum present*** (sequestrum is avascular → antibiotics cannot reach it → must be physically removed)
- ***Abscess formation***
- ***Failed medical treatment***
- Draining sinus tract (will not resolve without removing the source — the sequestrum)

#### 2b. Surgical Procedures by Cierny-Mader Stage

The Cierny-Mader classification directly guides the surgical approach [1]:

| ***Stage*** | ***Procedure*** | ***Rationale*** |
|---|---|---|
| ***Stage I — Medullary osteomyelitis*** | ***Early: Antibiotics/host alteration. Late: Unroofing, intramedullary reaming*** [1] | Unroofing = creating a cortical window to access the medullary canal and drain pus. Intramedullary reaming = using a reamer to remove infected/necrotic medullary contents, like scooping out the inside of a tube |
| ***Stage II — Superficial osteomyelitis*** | ***Early: Antibiotics/host alteration. Late: Superficial debridement/coverage. Possible ablation*** [1] | Debridement of the exposed necrotic bone surface + soft tissue coverage (flap) to bring in blood supply. "Ablation" = amputation if the disease is too extensive or the host too compromised |
| ***Stage III — Localized osteomyelitis*** | ***Antibiotics/host alteration. Debridement, dead space management. Temporary stabilization, bone graft optional*** [1] | After debridement, a dead space (cavity) remains where the infected bone was removed. This must be managed (see below) to prevent re-infection. Bone graft fills the void |
| ***Stage IV — Diffuse osteomyelitis*** | ***Antibiotics/host alteration. Stabilization – ORIF, external fixation (Ilizarov). Debridement, dead space management. Possible ablation*** [1] | Diffuse disease may render the bone unstable after debridement → requires stabilisation. ***Ilizarov external fixation*** allows bone transport (gradually moving a segment of healthy bone to fill the defect) — a remarkable technique for large segmental defects |

#### 2c. Key Surgical Concepts

##### Sequestrectomy
- Removal of dead bone (sequestrum) — the fundamental surgical procedure in chronic osteomyelitis
- Without sequestrectomy, cure is impossible because the sequestrum acts as a foreign body harbouring bacteria

##### Dead Space Management
- After debridement/sequestrectomy, a cavity remains within the bone. If left empty, it fills with haematoma → re-infection
- Options for dead space management:
  - **Antibiotic-impregnated PMMA beads** (polymethylmethacrylate) — placed in the cavity; elute high local antibiotic concentrations (typically gentamicin or vancomycin); eventually removed and replaced with bone graft at a second stage
  - **Antibiotic-impregnated calcium sulphate** — biodegradable alternative; dissolves over weeks and does not require removal
  - **Bone graft** (autologous cancellous bone from iliac crest) — fills the dead space with osteogenic tissue; typically placed after infection is controlled
  - **Muscle flap** — brings in blood supply to the cavity, which enhances antibiotic delivery and immune cell access. Common flaps: gastrocnemius (proximal tibia), soleus (mid-tibia)
  - **Masquelet technique (induced membrane technique)** — a two-stage approach: (1) cement spacer placed after debridement → induces a biological membrane around it over 6–8 weeks; (2) spacer removed, cavity filled with bone graft contained within the induced membrane (which is rich in growth factors and acts as a biological chamber for osteogenesis)

##### Bone Stabilisation
- After extensive debridement, the bone may become structurally unstable (risk of pathological fracture)
- Options:
  - ***External fixation (Ilizarov frame)*** [1] — allows bone transport (distraction osteogenesis: cut healthy bone proximally → gradually transport it distally through the defect at ~1mm/day → new bone forms in the gap = regenerate). This is used for large segmental defects
  - ***ORIF*** [1] — plates and screws; used when bone remains relatively stable after debridement
  - **Intramedullary nail** — may be used after thorough debridement; antibiotic-coated nails are available

##### Soft Tissue Coverage
- Particularly important for tibial osteomyelitis (tibia has minimal soft tissue coverage anteriorly — subcutaneous bone)
- **Local flaps**: gastrocnemius (proximal 1/3 tibia), soleus (middle 1/3 tibia)
- **Free flaps**: for distal 1/3 tibia or large defects — microvascular free tissue transfer (e.g., latissimus dorsi, anterolateral thigh flap)

#### 2d. Implant-Related Osteomyelitis

This deserves special discussion because the management depends critically on **whether the fracture has healed**:

| Scenario | Management | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Fracture healed, implant stable but infected** | Remove implant + thorough debridement + prolonged antibiotics | Once the fracture is healed, the implant serves no structural purpose and becomes the source of persistent infection (biofilm). Remove it |
| **Fracture NOT healed, implant infected (early, < 3 weeks)** | DAIR protocol: **D**ebridement, **A**ntibiotics, **I**mplant **R**etention (or exchange to new implant) | Early infection may have immature biofilm that can be disrupted by aggressive debridement + rifampicin-based combination therapy. The implant is still needed for fracture stability |
| **Fracture NOT healed, implant infected (late, > 3 weeks)** | Remove implant → external fixation (to maintain alignment) → debridement → staged reconstruction once infection eradicated | Late biofilm is mature and cannot be eradicated with implant in situ. External fixation provides stability without an internal foreign body |

#### 2e. Amputation — When All Else Fails

***Possible ablation*** is mentioned in the Cierny-Mader classification for Stages II and IV [1], and amputation is explicitly an endpoint in severe musculoskeletal infections.

**Indications for amputation in osteomyelitis** [11][1]:

***Factors favouring amputation over limb salvage*** [1]:
- ***Concurrent medical disease with high anaesthetic risk from multiple operations (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, valvular heart disease)***
- ***Myonecrosis***
- ***Unremitting shock***
- ***Concurrent peripheral vascular insufficiency***
- ***Rapidly progressive infection***
- ***Large area of tissue necrosis (heel pad and sole skin loss)***

***Factors favouring limb salvage*** [1]:
- ***Good past health***
- ***Not life-threatening state***
- ***Multiple sites***
- ***Responsive to inotropic support***

The mnemonic for indications of amputation is the **3 D's** [11]:
- ***Dead***: Ischaemia and unsalvageable
- ***Damage***: Trauma/Burns
- ***Danger***: Gangrene / Necrotising fasciitis / ***Osteomyelitis*** / Ascending sepsis / Malignancy

**Levels of amputation** [11]:
- **Digital amputation**: isolated gangrene or recalcitrant osteomyelitis of a toe
- **Transmetatarsal**: several toes involved
- **Below knee amputation (BKA)**: ***most common type*** — 90% of patients walk again; energy expenditure ↑40% unilateral
- **Above knee amputation (AKA)**: 50% walk again; energy expenditure ↑100% unilateral

---

### 3. Supportive / Adjunctive Management

| Measure | Detail | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| ***Analgesics*** [2] | Paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioids as needed | Pain from raised intraosseous pressure and periosteal inflammation; adequate analgesia also facilitates rehabilitation |
| **Immobilisation / splinting** | Splint or cast for affected limb (especially in children) | Reduces pain, prevents pathological fracture through weakened bone, maintains alignment |
| **Nutritional optimisation** | High-protein diet, correct albumin, vitamin C, zinc supplementation | Wound healing and immune function depend critically on nutritional status; malnourished patients have higher failure rates |
| ***Host alteration*** [1] | Optimise diabetes control (HbA1c < 8%), smoking cessation, treat immunosuppression, improve nutrition | The Cierny-Mader system emphasises treating the host as much as the bone — a Class B or C host will not heal regardless of how good the surgery is |
| **DVT prophylaxis** | LMWH (enoxaparin) if immobilised/post-surgery | Immobilisation + infection → hypercoagulable state → DVT/PE risk |
| **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)** | Adjunctive in refractory chronic osteomyelitis | Increases tissue oxygen tension → enhances WBC killing ability (oxidative burst is O₂-dependent), promotes angiogenesis, enhances antibiotic efficacy (aminoglycosides require O₂ for uptake). Evidence is limited but used in select refractory cases |

---

### 4. Management of Specific Scenarios

#### 4a. Vertebral Osteomyelitis
- **First-line: Prolonged IV antibiotics (6–8 weeks)** — vertebral osteomyelitis often responds to medical management alone
- **Immobilisation**: brace or external orthosis to reduce pain and prevent deformity
- **Indications for surgery**: neurological deficit (epidural abscess compressing cord/cauda equina), spinal instability, failure of medical therapy, progressive kyphotic deformity
- **Surgery**: anterior debridement + interbody fusion (most common approach) — anterior approach gives direct access to the vertebral body and disc space

#### 4b. Diabetic Foot Osteomyelitis [3]
- **Assess vascularity first**: ***TcPO₂ > 30mmHg = adequate healing potential*** [3]; ***ABPI not useful in DM due to vessel calcification*** [3]
- **If adequate perfusion**: debridement of infected bone + prolonged antibiotics (culture-guided from bone biopsy)
- **If inadequate perfusion**: ***vascular component: angioplasty*** [3] first to restore blood supply → then reassess
- ***Neuropathic component: customised insole*** [3] to offload pressure and prevent recurrence
- ***Surgical: debridement, below knee amputation*** [3] if the limb is non-salvageable
- Multidisciplinary approach: orthopaedics, vascular surgery, endocrinology, podiatry, wound care nurse

#### 4c. TB Osteomyelitis (Pott's Disease)
- **Anti-TB chemotherapy**: RIPE × 2 months → RI × 7–10 months (total 9–12 months)
- **Immobilisation/bracing** for spinal TB
- **Surgery**: drainage of cold abscess, anterior decompression + fusion if neurological deficit or severe kyphosis (gibbus deformity)
- **Unlike pyogenic osteomyelitis**, TB spine responds well to chemotherapy alone in most cases; surgery is reserved for complications

---

### 5. Contraindications and Cautions

| Intervention | Contraindications / Cautions |
|---|---|
| **Surgical debridement** | Cierny-Mader Host Class C — treatment morbidity exceeds disease morbidity; consider suppressive antibiotics only. Also: unacceptable anaesthetic risk, patient refuses surgery |
| **Vancomycin** | Renal impairment (nephrotoxic — requires dose adjustment and TDM); "Red man syndrome" if infused too fast (histamine release — not a true allergy) |
| **Rifampicin** | Severe hepatic impairment; concurrent warfarin/OCP use (potent CYP450 inducer → reduces drug levels); never use as monotherapy (rapid resistance) |
| **Linezolid** | Prolonged use ( > 4 weeks) → myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia, anaemia), peripheral neuropathy, lactic acidosis; serotonin syndrome if combined with SSRIs/MAOIs (linezolid is a weak MAO inhibitor) |
| **Fluoroquinolones** | Tendon rupture risk (especially in elderly on steroids); avoid in growing children (theoretical cartilage damage — though increasingly used short-course in paediatric osteomyelitis when benefits outweigh risks); QT prolongation |
| **Aminoglycosides** | Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity with prolonged use; require TDM; less effective in acidic/anaerobic abscess environments |
| **Implant retention (DAIR)** | Contraindicated if mature biofilm (infection > 3 weeks), loose implant, sinus tract, difficult-to-treat organisms (MRSA, fungi) |
| **Amputation** | Not a contraindication per se, but should be a last resort — consider limb salvage first if the patient is fit enough for multiple operations |
