## Management of Acute Cholangitis

### Guiding Principles — Why We Treat the Way We Do

Before diving into specifics, let's ground the entire management framework in the pathophysiology we've already established. Acute cholangitis = **obstructed + infected biliary tree**. Therefore, management must address **three pillars** simultaneously [1][2][3][17][18]:

1. **Resuscitate the patient** — they are septic; support the circulation and organs.
2. **Kill the bacteria** — IV antibiotics to control the infection.
3. **Relieve the obstruction** — biliary drainage to decompress the system (because ***antibiotics alone cannot work in an obstructed system*** — their excretion into bile is impaired [3]).

After the acute episode is controlled, a fourth pillar becomes relevant:

4. **Treat the underlying cause** — to prevent recurrence (e.g., cholecystectomy for gallstones, stent for malignant stricture, hepatectomy for RPC).

The mnemonic from the senior notes captures this perfectly:

<Callout title="RAD — Acute Management Framework (Must Know!)">

***R*** = ***Resuscitation*** (NPO, IV fluids, monitor vitals & I/O)
***A*** = ***Antibiotics*** (IV, broad-spectrum, targeting biliary pathogens)
***D*** = ***Drainage*** (biliary decompression — urgency determined by severity grading)

Then: **Definitive management** of the underlying cause once acute sepsis resolved [2].

### Pillar 1: Resuscitation (R)

This is **standard sepsis management** — the same principles you'd apply to any patient with sepsis from any source. The biliary focus simply adds specific nuances [1][2][17][18].

| Intervention | Rationale | Details |
|---|---|---|
| ***Keep the patient fasting (NPO)*** | Bowel rest reduces cholecystokinin (CCK) release → reduces gallbladder contraction and bile flow → reduces pressure in the obstructed system. Also prepares the patient for potential ERCP/surgery [2][7][17]. | ***"Keep the patient fast"*** [7]. |
| ***Intravenous fluid resuscitation*** | Sepsis causes vasodilation + capillary leak + third-space losses → intravascular volume depletion → tissue hypoperfusion. Aggressive IV crystalloid restores circulating volume and supports organ perfusion [1][2][17][18]. | Target **urine output > 0.5 mL/kg/h** as a marker of adequate renal perfusion. |
| **Monitor vitals and I/O Q1h** | ***Continuous monitoring of vitals to look for signs of failure of conservative treatment*** [1][2]: ↑ Temperature/Pulse; ↓ BP/Consciousness level/Urine output; increased abdominal tenderness and guarding. | These are red flags indicating deterioration — triggers for escalation to urgent drainage. |
| **Blood cultures × 2 before antibiotics** | Identify the causative organism and guide de-escalation from empirical to targeted therapy [2]. Must be taken **before** antibiotics (antibiotics sterilise blood quickly). | Aerobic + anaerobic bottles, from two different venepuncture sites. |
| **Correct coagulopathy** | Obstructive jaundice → impaired bile salt delivery to gut → reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin K → deficiency of clotting factors II, VII, IX, X → coagulopathy [1]. Must correct **before any invasive procedure** (ERCP, PTBD). | IV Vitamin K (phytomenadione) 10 mg slow IV. Effect takes ~6–12 hours. For urgent procedures, consider fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for immediate correction. |
| **Analgesics** | Pain control is humane and reduces sympathetic drive (which worsens tachycardia and vasoconstriction). | Paracetamol, NSAIDs (with caution if renal function impaired), opioids if needed. **Avoid morphine** if concurrent pancreatitis suspected (potential sphincter of Oddi spasm) [19]. |
| **Organ support if needed** | Grade III (severe) cholangitis with organ dysfunction may require ICU admission. | Vasopressors for refractory hypotension (noradrenaline first-line in septic shock), mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, renal replacement therapy for AKI. |

> **High-Yield**: ***Recognize signs of shock*** — ***hypotension, oliguria, changes in mental status, cold and clammy skin, and metabolic acidosis*** — these are signs that the patient is moving towards Grade III and requires emergency intervention [1].

### Pillar 2: Antibiotics (A)

#### Why Antibiotics Matter — But Aren't Enough

Antibiotics target the bacteria driving the infection. However, recall the critical pathophysiology: ***excretion of antibiotics into bile is impaired in biliary obstruction*** [3]. This means that even with the correct antibiotic given IV, therapeutic concentrations at the site of infection (within the obstructed biliary tree) may not be achieved. This is why ***biliary drainage is mandatory*** — you must open the system for the antibiotics to work [3].

That said, antibiotics are essential to control the systemic sepsis (bacteraemia) and prevent progression to multi-organ failure while drainage is being arranged.

#### Empirical Antibiotic Regimens

Empirical antibiotics must cover the expected biliary pathogens: ***Gram-negative rods*** (E. coli, Klebsiella) + ***Enterococci*** + ***Anaerobes*** [1][7].

| Regimen | Components | When to Use | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***IV Cefuroxime + Metronidazole*** | 2nd-gen cephalosporin (Gram-neg cover) + nitroimidazole (anaerobic cover) | ***Mild-to-moderate cholangitis*** [7] | Cefuroxime covers most community-acquired Gram-negatives; metronidazole ("metro" = uterus in Greek, but the drug targets **anaerobes** by forming toxic free radicals in anaerobic bacteria that lack protective enzymes). |
| ***IV Augmentin (Amoxicillin-Clavulanate)*** | Aminopenicillin + β-lactamase inhibitor | ***Mild cholangitis*** [2] | Covers Gram-positives (including Enterococci), many Gram-negatives, and some anaerobes. The clavulanate inhibits bacterial β-lactamase enzymes that would otherwise destroy the amoxicillin. |
| ***IV Piperacillin-Tazobactam (Tazocin)*** | Extended-spectrum penicillin + β-lactamase inhibitor | ***Severe cholangitis*** [2][7] | Broader spectrum than Augmentin — covers Pseudomonas aeruginosa (critical if **stent-related cholangitis**), Enterococci, Gram-negatives, and anaerobes. Tazobactam inhibits a wider range of β-lactamases. |
| **Metronidazole + 3rd-gen cephalosporin (Ceftriaxone)** | As described | Alternative regimen [1] | Ceftriaxone provides excellent Gram-negative cover including many resistant organisms; add metronidazole for anaerobes. Note: ceftriaxone does **not** cover Enterococci. |
| **Metronidazole + Fluoroquinolone (Ciprofloxacin/Levofloxacin)** | As described | Alternative regimen (e.g., penicillin allergy) [1] | Fluoroquinolones provide Gram-negative and some Gram-positive cover. Use with caution due to increasing resistance and side effects (tendon rupture, QT prolongation). |

<Callout title="Antibiotic Choice Summary from Lecture Slides">

***Lecture slide antibiotics for acute cholangitis*** [7]:
- ***Cefuroxime***
- ***Metronidazole***
- ***Piperacillin + Tazobactam***

***Senior notes*** [2]:
- ***Mild: IV Augmentin***
- ***Severe: IV Tazocin***
- **Duration: × 7 days** (adjust based on culture results and clinical response)
</Callout>

#### Duration and De-escalation

- **Empirical antibiotics for 7 days** [2], or until the source is controlled (drainage achieved) and clinical response is seen.
- **De-escalate** to targeted therapy once blood/bile culture and sensitivity results are available.
- In mild cases that respond quickly to drainage, shorter courses (3–5 days) may be adequate per TG18 recommendations.

#### Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Procedures

- ***Antibiotics are recommended before ERCP***, especially in acute cholangitis — the biliary tract is normally sterile, and instrumentation can introduce or exacerbate infection [16][20].
- If ERCP results in ***incomplete drainage***, antibiotics should be ***continued after the procedure*** [20].

---

### Pillar 3: Drainage (D) — Biliary Decompression

This is the **most critical** pillar. Without drainage, the obstructed, infected biliary tree acts like an undrained abscess — no amount of antibiotics will clear the infection if the pus (infected bile) remains under pressure [3].

#### When to Drain — Guided by Severity

| TG18 Grade | Drainage Timing | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Grade I (Mild)** | **Elective/early** — antibiotics first, drain when available | Most respond to antibiotics initially. However, early drainage is still recommended to prevent deterioration. |
| **Grade II (Moderate)** | ***Early drainage within 24–48 hours*** | Does not respond to initial medical treatment, or has risk factors for deterioration. Delay increases morbidity. |
| **Grade III (Severe)** | ***URGENT/EMERGENCY drainage*** | Organ dysfunction present. ***Urgent if Reynolds' pentad, not responding to antibiotics for 24h*** [2]. Every hour of delay increases mortality. |

<Callout title="15% Rule" type="error">
***15% of patients will NOT respond to antibiotics*** and require emergency biliary decompression [1]. This is why you must continuously monitor — if the patient is not improving within 24 hours, escalate to drainage regardless of severity grade.
</Callout>

#### Drainage Modalities — The Escalation Ladder

The ***QMH practice*** drainage escalation is: ***ERCP → PTBD → ECBD*** [1]. Let's detail each step.

---

#### D1. ***Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)*** — 1st Line

***ERCP +/- biliary stenting*** is the ***first-line approach*** for biliary drainage in acute cholangitis [2][7][14].

**Breaking down the name**: "Endoscopic" = using an endoscope; "Retrograde" = going backwards (against the normal flow of bile, from the duodenum up into the duct); "Cholangio-" = bile duct; "Pancreatography" = imaging of the pancreatic duct. So ERCP = using an endoscope to image and access the bile and pancreatic ducts from below.

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Role in acute cholangitis** | ***Biliary drainage and decompression in unstable patients — NOT stone removal*** [2]. The priority is to decompress the infected system, not to clear every stone. |
| **Technique** | 1. ***Aspirate bile duct first*** → removes bile and pus → decompresses biliary tree → ***reduces risk of inducing bacteraemia during contrast injection*** [2]. 2. Inject contrast → delineate anatomy, level and cause of obstruction. 3. ***Place plastic stent*** (temporary, requires scheduled change) to maintain duct patency and drainage [2]. 4. ± Sphincterotomy (cut the sphincter of Oddi with electrocautery to facilitate drainage/stone extraction). |
| **Stone removal timing** | ***Remove stone now OR interval ERCP after sepsis resolves*** [2]. In a sick, unstable patient, just stent and drain. Come back for definitive stone removal when the patient is stable. |
| **Stent types** | ***Plastic stent*** — for acute drainage (temporary, cheaper, requires scheduled replacement every 3 months as they occlude). ***Self-expanding metal stent (SEMS)*** — for malignant obstruction (more durable, longer patency, but more expensive and difficult to remove) [1][15]. |
| **Mortality** | ***< 5%*** with endoscopic drainage [2] — compared to **~30% mortality** with surgical exploration of CBD [2]. |
| **Methods of stone retrieval (when stable)** | ***Wire baskets*** — literally a wire cage that captures the stone. ***Stone extraction balloon*** — inflated below the stone and pulled down to sweep it out. ***Mechanical lithotripsy*** — crushes large stones too big to extract whole [10]. |

| ***Potential complications*** [7][14] | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Perforation*** | **Intraperitoneal perforation**: duodenal wall perforated → free gas under diaphragm on CXR → requires **operative treatment** (will not seal spontaneously). **Retroperitoneal perforation**: bile duct perforated when cutting the ampulla (retroperitoneal portion of D2) → no free gas under diaphragm, but **retroperitoneal gas may be present** on CT → usually **conservative treatment** (seals spontaneously) [1]. |
| ***Bleeding from papillotomy (sphincterotomy)*** | Electrocautery incision through the sphincter may transect a blood vessel at the papilla. Usually controlled endoscopically (adrenaline injection, clips, cautery). |
| ***Post-ERCP pancreatitis*** | Occurs in ~3–5% of ERCPs. Cannulation and contrast injection can traumatise the pancreatic duct orifice → oedema at the ampulla → obstruction of pancreatic duct → enzyme activation → pancreatitis. Prevention: pancreatic duct stent placement, rectal NSAIDs (diclofenac/indomethacin) [16]. |
| **Infection (flare-up sepsis)** | Injecting contrast into an obstructed system can worsen bacteraemia. That's why ***aspirate first before injecting contrast*** [2]. |

| ***Relative contraindications for ERCP*** [7][14] | Rationale |
|---|---|
| ***Altered GI anatomy*** — ***Billroth II gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y*** | The side-viewing duodenoscope cannot reach the papilla when the normal duodenal anatomy has been surgically altered. In Billroth II, the duodenal stump is closed; in Roux-en-Y, the efferent limb is too long for a standard scope. May require balloon-assisted enteroscopy ERCP or surgical approach. |
| **Unstable patient** (absolute) | Cannot tolerate sedation/prone position. Stabilise first, then drain. If too unstable for ERCP, consider bedside PTBD. |
| **Uncorrected coagulopathy** | Sphincterotomy carries bleeding risk. Either correct coagulopathy first, or use ***nasobiliary drain or direct stent placement without sphincterotomy*** as an alternative in patients with coagulopathy [1]. |
| **Contrast allergy** (absolute) | Risk of anaphylaxis. |

<Callout title="Nasobiliary Drain — The Coagulopathy Option">
In patients where **sphincterotomy cannot be performed** (e.g., due to coagulopathy), a ***nasobiliary drain catheter*** can be placed during ERCP without cutting the sphincter. This permits ***active decompression of the CBD by aspiration*** and provides a route for irrigation of the biliary system. The catheter exits through the nose, allowing bedside monitoring of bile output [1].
</Callout>

**Papillary Balloon Dilatation (Balloon Sphincteroplasty)** — an alternative to sphincterotomy:
- Dilates the ampulla with a balloon rather than cutting it, attempting to **preserve the biliary sphincter** [1].
- Lower risk of bleeding than sphincterotomy.
- Safety has been questioned (higher risk of pancreatitis in early studies); ***endoscopic sphincterotomy remains the method of choice*** [1].

---

#### D2. ***Percutaneous Transhepatic Biliary Drainage (PTBD)*** — 2nd Line

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **When used** | ***Indicated when ERCP is unsuccessful, unavailable, or contraindicated*** (e.g., altered GI anatomy, poor respiratory function preventing sedation/prone position) [1][2]. |
| **Procedure** | Under USG/fluoroscopic guidance, a needle is inserted percutaneously through the liver into a ***dilated intrahepatic bile duct*** (***NOT the CBD directly***) [2]. Guidewire → catheter placement → external drainage. |
| **Preferred access** | ***Left hepatic duct*** — subcostal approach is ***less painful*** than intercostal route for right duct and ***less likely to transgress the pleural space*** [1]. |
| **Efficacy** | ***Similar efficacy and complication rates as ERCP*** [2]. |
| **Advantages** | ***Easy output monitoring*** — external drainage catheter allows direct measurement of bile output [2]. Can be ***internalised later*** (internal-external drainage). Can access ***hilar and intrahepatic obstruction*** that ERCP cannot reach from below (e.g., Klatskin tumour, RPC) [4]. |
| **Limitations** | More invasive (traverses liver parenchyma). Risk of bleeding (haemobilia), pneumothorax (right-sided approach), bile leak, catheter dislodgement. ***Risk of fluid and electrolyte loss*** through external drainage [2]. |
| **Confirmation of adequate drainage** | Steady decline in serum bilirubin over subsequent days [1]. |

> ***Management of cholangitis: Resuscitation → Treat sepsis with intravenous antibiotic → Decompression of biliary system: Endoscopic vs percutaneous → Definitive management*** [3][17][18].

---

#### D3. ***Surgical Drainage — Exploration of Common Bile Duct (ECBD)*** — Last Resort

***Surgical drainage is reserved for patients in whom other methods of biliary drainage cannot be performed or have failed*** [1][7][15].

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| ***Indications*** [7][15] | ***Failure of endoscopic drainage*** OR ***Deterioration despite endoscopic drainage***. |
| **Approach** | ***Open approach for emergency case; laparoscopic approach in selected elective cases*** [7][15]. |
| **Procedure** | Open/laparoscopic ECBD → **choledochotomy** (incision into CBD) → removal of stones → **placement of T-tube** for post-operative drainage and subsequent cholangiogram [1][2]. |
| **Mortality** | ***~30%*** in the emergency setting — significantly higher than endoscopic drainage ( < 5%) [2]. This is precisely why surgery is the **last resort**. |
| **T-tube** | A T-shaped rubber tube placed in the CBD after exploration. The horizontal limb sits inside the CBD; the vertical limb exits through the abdominal wall. Allows post-operative bile drainage + subsequent T-tube cholangiogram to check for residual stones. However, T-tubes are associated with complications (infection, bile leak, tube dislodgement) and are falling out of favour [10]. |

<Callout title="Surgical Treatment — Key Slide Points">

***Decompression by exploration of common bile duct (ECBD)*** [7][15]:
- ***Indications: failure of endoscopic drainage; deterioration despite endoscopic drainage***
- ***Open approach for emergency case***
- ***Laparoscopic approach in selected elective case***

This is the last step in the ***QMH escalation: ERCP → PTBD → ECBD*** [1].
</Callout>

---

#### D4. Therapeutic EUS (EUS-Guided Biliary Drainage) — Emerging Option

- ***EUS-guided cholangiopancreatography*** is an emerging technique when ERCP fails [2].
- The echoendoscope is used to puncture the bile duct from the stomach or duodenum under ultrasound guidance, and a stent is placed transmurally.
- Still requires specialised expertise and equipment; not universally available but increasingly used as a rescue option before resorting to surgery or PTBD.

### Summary: Drainage Escalation

| Step | Modality | Mortality | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1st line** | ***ERCP +/- biliary stenting*** | < 5% | Standard approach for all grades |
| **2nd line** | ***PTBD*** | Similar to ERCP | ERCP fails/contraindicated |
| **Emerging** | **EUS-guided biliary drainage** | Data evolving | ERCP fails, expertise available |
| **3rd line (last resort)** | ***Surgical ECBD + T-tube*** | ~30% | Both ERCP and PTBD fail |

---

### Pillar 4: Definitive Management — Treating the Underlying Cause

***Definitive treatment should be deferred until cholangitis has been treated and the proper diagnosis is established*** [1][18]. Once the acute sepsis is controlled and the patient is stable, address the underlying etiology to prevent recurrence.

| Underlying Cause | Definitive Management | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| ***Choledocholithiasis (gallstones)*** | ***ERCP for stone removal (lithotripsy) + Laparoscopic cholecystectomy*** [2][10] | **Early cholecystectomy** (during the same admission, rather than interval) is now preferred — reduces risk of recurrent biliary events. Stone removal at ERCP: sphincterotomy + wire basket / balloon extraction / mechanical lithotripsy [10]. Note: ***ascending cholangitis is still possible after cholecystectomy*** due to biliary stasis from ***ERCP-induced CBD dilatation or ageing-related CBD dilatation*** [2]. |
| ***Stent occlusion*** | ***Stent removal and replacement*** [1] | Patients with indwelling stents and cholangitis usually require repeated imaging and stent exchange. Plastic stents occlude every ~3 months; metal stents last longer but can also occlude (sludge, tumour ingrowth/overgrowth). |
| ***Benign biliary stricture*** | ***Endoscopic stent placement / balloon dilatation*** [2] | Serial dilatation and stenting over months may be needed. If refractory, surgical biliary-enteric anastomosis (hepaticojejunostomy). |
| ***Malignant biliary obstruction (MBO)*** | Determined by resectability [1][3][17][18] | ***Establish diagnosis → Delineate level and cause of obstruction → Treat suppurative cholangitis → Definitive treatment*** [3][17]. **Resectable**: Surgical resection (e.g., ***Whipple operation*** for pancreatic head/periampullary tumour). **Unresectable**: Palliative stenting (***metallic stent*** preferred for durability) or palliative surgical bypass (***hepaticojejunostomy / choledochojejunostomy***) [1]. |
| ***RPC*** | ***Regular ductal clearance + surgical resection*** [2][4] | ERCP is difficult for intrahepatic access → ***PTBD, T-tube drainage, hepaticocutaneojejunostomy (HCJ)*** for acute drainage [4]. Long-term: regular USG surveillance, ERCP stone clearance/stricture dilatation. ***Resection of affected hepatobiliary segment + biliary-enteric anastomosis (hepaticojejunostomy)*** — indicated for atrophic liver segment, failed non-operative treatment, or suspected cholangiocarcinoma [4]. |
| **Parasitic infection** | ***Praziquantel*** (for Clonorchis sinensis: 25 mg/kg PO TDS × 1 day) [4] | Eradicate the parasite to break the cycle of epithelial damage → stricture → stasis → stone formation. |

### Management According to Clinical Scenario — Synthesis

| Scenario | Acute Management | Drainage Approach | Definitive Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Grade I cholangitis from CBD stone** | NPO, IVF, IV Augmentin, monitor | Elective ERCP (sphincterotomy + stone extraction) | Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy |
| **Grade II cholangitis from CBD stone** | NPO, IVF, IV Tazocin, monitor closely | Early ERCP within 24–48h (stent ± stone extraction) | Interval stone removal if deferred + cholecystectomy |
| **Grade III cholangitis (Reynolds' pentad)** | Aggressive resuscitation, IVF, vasopressors if needed, IV Tazocin, ICU | ***URGENT ERCP*** → PTBD if fails → ECBD if both fail | Once stable: definitive treatment of cause |
| **Cholangitis from malignant obstruction** | NPO, IVF, IV antibiotics, correct coagulopathy | ERCP stenting (plastic → metal when diagnosis confirmed) OR PTBD if hilar obstruction | Staging workup → resection if operable; palliative stenting/bypass if not |
| **Cholangitis from stent occlusion** | NPO, IVF, IV Tazocin (cover Pseudomonas) | ERCP: stent removal and replacement | Evaluate for underlying cause of stent dysfunction; regular stent exchange programme |
| **RPC with acute cholangitis** | NPO, IVF, IV antibiotics | PTBD (ERCP often inadequate for intrahepatic access) | Regular ductal clearance; hepatobiliary resection + HJ if indicated |

---

### Post-ERCP Monitoring — Detecting Complications

After ERCP, watch for [16]:

| Complication | Clinical Clue | Investigation | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Persistent cholangitis** | Ongoing fever, tachycardia post-ERCP | AXR (stent migration/blockage), bloods | ***Unsuccessful drainage, migrated/blocked stent***, or resistant organisms → repeat ERCP or PTBD [16] |
| ***Flare-up sepsis*** | Fever spike immediately post-procedure | Blood cultures, repeat bloods | Continued antibiotics, ensure adequate drainage [16] |
| **Post-ERCP pancreatitis** | Epigastric pain, elevated amylase ( > 3× ULN) | Amylase/lipase, CT if severe | Supportive (NPO, IVF, analgesics) |
| **Perforation** | Abdominal pain, peritonism, surgical emphysema | ***CT abdomen: retroperitoneal free gas*** [16] | Intraperitoneal: surgery. Retroperitoneal: usually conservative (seals spontaneously) [1]. |
| **Bleeding** | Haematemesis, melaena, drop in Hb | OGD | Endoscopic haemostasis (adrenaline injection, clips, cautery) |

---

### Complications of Sphincterotomy — Short-Term and Long-Term

| Time Frame | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Short-term** | ***Acute pancreatitis*** | Ampullary oedema → pancreatic duct obstruction → enzyme activation |
| | ***Perforation (intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal)*** | Electrocautery cut extends beyond the sphincter |
| | ***Bleeding*** | Transection of papillary vessels |
| | ***Infection*** | Introduction of bacteria during instrumentation |
| **Long-term** | ***Recurrent cholangitis*** | Loss of sphincter of Oddi barrier → free duodenal reflux → ascending infection, especially if biliary stasis persists |
| | ***Stone recurrence*** | Altered biliary dynamics post-sphincterotomy; ~5% risk of recurrent biliary events even after cholecystectomy [10] |
| | **Papillary stenosis** | Scarring at the sphincterotomy site → re-stenosis → obstruction |
