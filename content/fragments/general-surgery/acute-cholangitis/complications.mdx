## Complications of Acute Cholangitis

### Framework — Why Complications Occur

To understand the complications of acute cholangitis, think about the disease as an **escalating cascade** with three domains of damage:

1. **Local complications** — direct consequences of infected bile under pressure within the biliary tree and surrounding structures.
2. **Systemic complications** — consequences of bacteraemia and sepsis once bacteria and endotoxins reflux from the biliary system into the circulation (***when intraductal pressure exceeds 25 cm H₂O*** [3]).
3. **Iatrogenic complications** — consequences of the interventions (ERCP, PTBD, surgery) used to treat cholangitis.

Additionally, there are **long-term complications** from recurrent or inadequately treated cholangitis.

Let's work through each systematically.

---

### A. Local Complications — Direct Extension of Biliary Infection

These result from the **infected bile under pressure eroding into, or extending beyond, the bile duct** into adjacent structures.

#### A1. Liver Abscess (Pyogenic)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Infected bile under high pressure in the intrahepatic ducts → bacteria disseminate into the surrounding hepatic parenchyma → focal collection of pus forms → **pyogenic liver abscess** [4][11][21]. This is essentially the "path of least resistance" — the infected bile breaks through the duct wall into the liver tissue. |
| **Why right lobe is more common** | The right hepatic lobe is larger and receives a greater proportion of portal blood flow, making it more susceptible to haematogenous and biliary seeding [11]. |
| **Clinical clue** | Patient with cholangitis who develops ***swinging (spiking) fever*** despite adequate biliary drainage — fever pattern shifts from the constant high fever of cholangitis to a "picket-fence" swing pattern typical of an abscess. ***Tender hepatomegaly*** with minimal jaundice improvement [11]. |
| **Diagnosis** | ***CT abdomen with contrast***: **double-target sign** (rim-enhancing lesion with central hypodensity) [11]. USG: hypoechoic collection in liver parenchyma — which is why USG should always be performed in cholangitis workup to rule out co-existing abscess [2]. |
| **Management** | IV antibiotics (prolonged course, 4–6 weeks) + image-guided **percutaneous drainage** (aspiration if < 5 cm, catheter placement if > 5 cm) [11]. |

<Callout title="Liver Abscess — Common Complication to Watch For">
***Liver abscess*** is listed as a complication of gallstone disease [21] and is a well-recognised sequela of cholangitis. In Hong Kong, ***Klebsiella pneumoniae*** liver abscess is particularly important in patients > 60 years old with DM — if Klebsiella is identified, urgently consult ophthalmology to rule out **endophthalmitis** (metastatic infection of the eye) and monitor for meningitis [11].
</Callout>

#### A2. Gallbladder Empyema

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | If the cystic duct is simultaneously obstructed (e.g., by a stone in the cystic duct while another stone obstructs the CBD), the gallbladder becomes a closed, infected space. Stagnant bile becomes infected → pus fills the gallbladder = **empyema** ("em-" = in, "pyema" = pus). |
| **Clinical clue** | Tender, palpable RUQ mass + septic-looking patient. Essentially, this is severe acute cholecystitis superimposed on cholangitis. |
| **Management** | Percutaneous cholecystostomy for drainage in the acutely septic patient; definitive cholecystectomy once stable. |

#### A3. Biliary Stricture Formation

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Repeated episodes of cholangitis cause **chronic inflammation → fibrosis → stricturing** of the bile duct wall. Each episode of infection and healing lays down more scar tissue, narrowing the duct lumen progressively [4]. This is the fundamental pathology in **recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC)** — stasis + stricturing + recurrent infection in a vicious cycle [4]. |
| **Consequence** | Strictures perpetuate obstruction → predispose to further cholangitis episodes → more stricturing. Without definitive treatment (e.g., resection, biliary-enteric anastomosis), the cycle is self-reinforcing. |
| **Long-term risk** | Chronic inflammation from recurrent stricturing is a risk factor for **cholangiocarcinoma** (malignant transformation of biliary epithelium) [4]. |

#### A4. Biliary Fistula

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Chronic inflammation and high intraductal pressure can erode the bile duct wall into adjacent structures, creating abnormal communications: **cholecystobiliary fistula** (between gallbladder and CBD, as in Mirizzi syndrome) [1], or **cholecystoenteric fistula** (between gallbladder and bowel — can cause gallstone ileus). |
| **Clinical significance** | Fistulae allow free passage of duodenal bacteria into the biliary tree (further perpetuating infection) and can cause complications such as gallstone ileus (large stone passes through fistula into bowel and impacts at the ileocaecal valve). |

---

### B. Systemic Complications — Consequences of Bacteraemia and Sepsis

These complications arise when the infection is no longer contained within the biliary tree and has spilled into the systemic circulation. The pathophysiology is: ***increased biliary pressure > 25 cm H₂O → bacteria reflux to hepatic veins and lymphatics → bacteraemia and septic shock*** [3].

#### B1. Sepsis and Septic Shock (Biliary Sepsis)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Gram-negative bacteria (especially E. coli, Klebsiella) release **endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS)** into the bloodstream → activates the innate immune system → massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6) → **systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)** → if uncontrolled → **sepsis** → **septic shock** [1][3]. |
| **Pathophysiology of septic shock** | Distributive shock: cytokines cause systemic **vasodilation** (loss of vascular tone) + **increased capillary permeability** (fluid leaks into interstitium) + **myocardial depression** (cytokine-mediated) → profound hypotension refractory to fluids alone → requires vasopressors. |
| **Clinical presentation** | ***Reynolds' pentad*** — Charcot's triad (fever, RUQ pain, jaundice) + ***hypotension*** + ***altered mental status (confusion)*** [1][2]. This represents ***suppurative cholangitis*** — frank pus under pressure in the bile duct with overwhelming sepsis. Present in < 10% of patients but carries very high mortality without emergency drainage [1][2]. |
| **Recognition** | ***Signs of shock: hypotension, oliguria, changes in mental status, cold and clammy skin, metabolic acidosis*** [1]. |
| **Why drainage is life-saving** | ***Excretion of antibiotics is impaired in biliary obstruction*** [3] — antibiotics alone cannot sterilise the obstructed, infected system. You must remove the source (decompress the bile duct) to break the septic cycle. ***Biliary drainage is mandatory*** [3]. |

<Callout title="Biliary Sepsis — The Critical Complication">
***Septic shock*** from cholangitis (Grade III, TG18) is a **surgical emergency**. Mortality without drainage approaches 50–100%. With timely endoscopic drainage, mortality drops to < 5% [2]. Every hour of delay matters.
</Callout>

#### B2. Multi-Organ Failure

When sepsis is not controlled, it progresses to **multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)** — the sequential or simultaneous failure of multiple organ systems:

| Organ System | Manifestation | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Cardiovascular** | Refractory hypotension, need for vasopressors | Vasodilation, myocardial depression from cytokines, capillary leak |
| **Respiratory** | ***Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)*** | Cytokine-mediated alveolar-capillary membrane damage → non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema → severe hypoxaemia. Neutrophils activated by sepsis marginate in the pulmonary vasculature and release proteases/oxidants that damage the alveolar epithelium. |
| **Renal** | ***Acute kidney injury (AKI)*** — oliguria, rising creatinine | Renal hypoperfusion from shock + direct nephrotoxicity from endotoxins + potential nephrotoxicity from antibiotics (aminoglycosides). Also, obstructive jaundice itself predisposes to **hepatorenal syndrome** via bile salt-mediated renal vasoconstriction. |
| **Hepatic** | Worsening liver function (rising bilirubin, falling albumin, prolonged PT) | Direct hepatocyte injury from biliary back-pressure + sepsis-related ischaemic hepatitis ("shock liver") + pre-existing cholestasis. |
| **Haematological** | ***Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)*** | Endotoxin activates the coagulation cascade → widespread microvascular thrombosis → consumption of clotting factors and platelets → paradoxical bleeding (consumption coagulopathy). Clinically: petechiae, oozing from IV sites, bleeding from mucosal surfaces. Lab: ↓ platelets, ↓ fibrinogen, ↑ D-dimer, prolonged PT/APTT. |
| **Neurological** | Altered mental status, confusion, coma | Cerebral hypoperfusion + metabolic encephalopathy (hepatic, uraemic) + direct endotoxin neurotoxicity. Part of Reynolds' pentad. |

> **High-Yield**: Multi-organ failure is the **cause of death** in fatal cholangitis. The progression is: cholangitis → bacteraemia → SIRS → sepsis → septic shock → MODS → death. Early drainage interrupts this cascade.

#### B3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Endotoxin (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria activates **tissue factor** on endothelial cells and monocytes → triggers the **extrinsic coagulation cascade** → widespread activation of thrombin → microvascular fibrin deposition → consumption of clotting factors (especially fibrinogen) and platelets → bleeding tendency. Simultaneously, fibrinolysis is activated to dissolve the microthrombi → D-dimer rises. |
| **Clinical significance** | DIC compounds the coagulopathy already present from **vitamin K deficiency** (biliary obstruction → impaired bile salt delivery to gut → impaired absorption of fat-soluble vitamin K → reduced synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, X). The combination makes haemorrhagic complications particularly dangerous. |
| **Lab findings** | ↓ Platelets, ↓ fibrinogen, ↑↑ D-dimer, prolonged PT and APTT, fragmented red cells (schistocytes) on blood film. |

---

### C. Complications Related to Biliary Obstruction Itself

Even before sepsis develops, the **obstruction component** of cholangitis causes its own set of problems:

#### C1. Acute Biliary Pancreatitis

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | If the obstructing stone is impacted at the **ampulla of Vater**, it blocks both the CBD and the **main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung)** → pancreatic enzyme stasis → premature intrapancreatic activation of trypsinogen → autodigestion of pancreatic tissue → **acute pancreatitis** [1][21]. |
| **Why it's a complication of cholangitis** | Cholangitis and biliary pancreatitis share the same underlying cause (impacted ampullary stone). They frequently **coexist** — always check amylase/lipase in cholangitis [2]. |
| **Clinical clue** | Epigastric pain radiating straight through to the back, relieved by sitting forward. Amylase/lipase > 3× upper limit of normal. |
| **Management** | ERCP within 24–72 hours for sphincterotomy and stone extraction when cholangitis and pancreatitis coexist [1][22]. |

#### C2. Coagulopathy from Vitamin K Deficiency

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Biliary obstruction → bile salts do not reach the duodenum → impaired emulsification and absorption of fats → impaired absorption of **fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)** → **vitamin K deficiency** → reduced hepatic synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, X (the "vitamin K-dependent factors") → prolonged PT/INR → bleeding tendency [1]. |
| **Clinical significance** | Must be corrected **before any invasive procedure** (ERCP, PTBD, surgery) — IV vitamin K takes 6–12h to take effect; for urgent procedures, give FFP for immediate correction. |

#### C3. Malnutrition and Fat Malabsorption

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Chronic/recurrent biliary obstruction → bile salts don't reach the gut → impaired fat emulsification → **steatorrhoea** (pale, fatty, foul-smelling stools that float) + malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Patients become malnourished, particularly with recurrent episodes (as in RPC). |

---

### D. Iatrogenic Complications — From the Treatments We Use

The drainage procedures themselves carry risks. These are important to know for exams because they frequently come up in the context of "complications of ERCP/PTBD."

#### D1. Complications of ERCP

***Potential complications of ERCP*** [7][14][16]:

| Complication | Incidence | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Post-ERCP pancreatitis*** | **~2–5%** (***most frequent*** complication) [16][23] | Manipulation of the papilla → oedema at the ampulla → obstruction of pancreatic duct orifice → premature enzyme activation → pancreatitis. Injection of contrast into the pancreatic duct increases risk. | Supportive (NPO, IVF, analgesics). Prevention: rectal NSAIDs (diclofenac/indomethacin), pancreatic duct stent, guidewire cannulation before contrast injection [16]. |
| ***Ascending infection / flare-up sepsis*** | ~1% [16] | Injection of contrast into an obstructed system → increases intraductal pressure → forces more bacteria into the bloodstream → transient worsening of bacteraemia. This is why ***aspirate bile first before injecting contrast*** [2]. Also occurs from ***unsuccessful drainage, migrated/blocked stent, resistant organisms*** [16]. | Ensure adequate drainage; if stent blocked/migrated → repeat ERCP or PTBD; broaden antibiotic coverage. Investigation: AXR (check stent position) [16]. |
| ***Post-sphincterotomy bleeding*** | ~2% [16] | Electrocautery incision through the sphincter transects a blood vessel at the papilla. Risk factors: intra-operative bleeding, **coagulopathy**, initiation of anticoagulants within 3 days, **active cholangitis** [16]. | Resuscitation → localisation → endoscopic haemostasis (injection of 1:10,000 adrenaline, clip application). Prevention: correct coagulopathy, cut along the right axis within the safety zone [16]. |
| ***Perforation*** | ~1% [16] | **Intraperitoneal perforation** (duodenal wall): free gas under diaphragm on CXR → requires **operative treatment** (will not seal spontaneously) [1]. **Retroperitoneal perforation** (bile duct at ampulla — retroperitoneal portion of D2): **no** free gas under diaphragm; ***retroperitoneal free gas*** on CT → usually **conservative treatment** (seals spontaneously) [1][16]. | Intraperitoneal: laparotomy + repair. Retroperitoneal: NPO, IV antibiotics, monitoring. |
| **Papillary stenosis** | Late complication | Scarring at the sphincterotomy site → fibrosis → re-stenosis of the ampulla → biliary obstruction → recurrent cholangitis. | Repeat sphincterotomy or balloon dilatation. |
| ***Stent occlusion*** | Expected with plastic stents (~3 months) | Sludge (bile sludge/biofilm), tumour ingrowth (through the stent mesh in metal stents), or tumour overgrowth (tumour grows over the ends of the stent) [15][21]. | Stent exchange (routine for plastic stents); sweeping or re-stenting for metal stents [21]. |
| ***Stent migration*** | Variable | Stent moves from its intended position → loss of drainage → recurrent obstruction and cholangitis. | Endoscopic retrieval and repositioning/replacement. Investigation: AXR to check stent position [16]. |

#### D2. Complications of PTBD

| Complication | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Bleeding / Haemobilia** | The percutaneous needle traverses liver parenchyma → may puncture a branch of the **hepatic artery or portal vein** (structures that run alongside bile ducts in the portal triad) → blood enters the biliary tree (haemobilia) or peritoneal cavity [15][16]. | Management: stabilise + resuscitate; clamp the PTBD catheter; perform cholangiogram via PTBD to delineate whether catheter is in artery/vein; remove catheter slowly to control bleeding — do NOT remove immediately as this may convert to free haemoperitoneum [15]. |
| ***Bacteraemia*** | Manipulation of the infected biliary system → bacteria reflux into the bloodstream. | ***Antibiotic prophylaxis is required*** for PTC/PTBD [16]. |
| **Bile leak / biliary peritonitis** | Bile leaks from the percutaneous tract into the peritoneal cavity. | Usually self-limited if catheter drains adequately; may require peritoneal drainage if peritonitis develops. |
| **Pneumothorax** | Right-sided intercostal approach → needle transgresses the pleural space. | This is why the ***left hepatic duct is preferred*** (subcostal approach) — ***less likely to transgress the pleural space*** [1]. |
| ***Fluid and electrolyte loss*** | External drainage catheter diverts bile externally → loss of bile salts, water, bicarbonate, electrolytes. | Monitor I/O carefully; replace losses; consider internalising the drainage (internal-external catheter) [2]. |
| **Catheter dislodgement** | Catheter pulled out accidentally → loss of access. | Secure the catheter properly; if dislodged, may need re-insertion. |

#### D3. Complications of Surgical ECBD

| Complication | Detail |
|---|---|
| **High mortality (~30%)** in emergency setting | Due to operating on a septic, unstable patient with biliary obstruction. The anaesthetic risk, surgical stress response, and compromised hepatic/renal function all contribute [2]. |
| **Biliary leak** | From the choledochotomy site or T-tube insertion site. |
| **T-tube complications** | Infection around the tube site, bile leak on removal, tube dislodgement, retained stone in the T-tube tract [10]. |
| **Wound infection** | Operating in a contaminated field (infected bile). |
| **Incisional hernia** | Long-term complication of laparotomy. |

---

### E. Long-Term Complications of Recurrent / Chronic Cholangitis

These are particularly relevant in the context of **recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC)** [4]:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Secondary biliary cirrhosis*** | Chronic, repeated biliary obstruction → persistent cholestasis → periductal fibrosis extends into hepatic parenchyma → progressive hepatic fibrosis → **cirrhosis**. This is "secondary" biliary cirrhosis because the cause is known (obstruction), as opposed to "primary" biliary cholangitis (autoimmune) [4]. |
| ***Cholangiocarcinoma*** | Chronic inflammation of biliary epithelium → **chronic cell turnover and repair** → increased risk of **malignant transformation** (inflammation → dysplasia → carcinoma sequence). This is analogous to how chronic ulcerative colitis predisposes to colorectal cancer, or how Barrett's oesophagus predisposes to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. RPC, PSC, liver fluke infection (Clonorchis sinensis), and choledochal cysts all carry significantly elevated risk of cholangiocarcinoma [4]. |
| **Recurrent cholangitis** | Even after definitive treatment (e.g., cholecystectomy), ascending cholangitis can recur due to: ***ERCP-induced CBD dilatation*** (loss of normal duct calibre → stasis); ***ageing-related CBD dilatation***; permanent loss of Sphincter of Oddi barrier after sphincterotomy [2]. |
| **Hepatic atrophy** | Segmental or lobar atrophy from chronic obstruction of the corresponding intrahepatic duct (the affected liver segment shrinks because bile cannot drain → chronic injury → fibrosis → atrophy). Particularly common in RPC affecting the left lobe [4]. |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Complications of acute cholangitis can be remembered as LOCAL → SYSTEMIC → IATROGENIC → LONG-TERM:**

**Local**: Liver abscess, gallbladder empyema, biliary stricture, biliary fistula.

**Systemic**: ***Biliary sepsis / septic shock*** (Reynolds' pentad) → ***multi-organ failure*** (ARDS, AKI, DIC, hepatic failure, encephalopathy). Mechanism: ***biliary pressure > 25 cm H₂O → cholangiovenous reflux → bacteraemia → SIRS → sepsis → MODS***. ***Biliary drainage is mandatory*** because ***antibiotic excretion is impaired in obstruction***.

**Iatrogenic**: ERCP complications = ***pancreatitis*** (most common, ~2–5%), ***perforation*** (intraperitoneal = surgery; retroperitoneal = conservative), ***bleeding***, ***flare-up sepsis***, stent occlusion/migration. PTBD = bleeding/haemobilia, pneumothorax, bacteraemia, fluid loss. Surgical ECBD = high mortality (~30%).

**Long-term** (especially in RPC): ***Secondary biliary cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma***, recurrent cholangitis, hepatic atrophy.

**Key principle**: The most dangerous complication is ***septic shock with multi-organ failure*** — early biliary drainage is life-saving and the single most important intervention to prevent this cascade.
