## Complications of Achalasia

Complications of achalasia can be divided into two categories: **(A) complications of the disease itself** (from chronic oesophageal stasis and dilation) and **(B) complications of treatment** (from the interventions used to manage it). Let's work through each from first principles, linking every complication back to its pathophysiological basis.

---

### A. Complications of the Disease

The root cause of all disease-related complications is the same: **functional obstruction at the LES + aperistalsis → chronic food stasis → progressive oesophageal dilation**. Everything else follows.

---

#### 1. ***Stasis of Food: Erosions, Candida Oesophagitis*** [2]

**Pathophysiology**: The non-relaxing LES and absent peristalsis cause food, liquid, and saliva to pool in the oesophagus for hours to days. This stagnant material directly irritates the oesophageal mucosa:

- **Erosive oesophagitis**: Retained food particles and pills cause mechanical and chemical irritation to the squamous epithelium. Additionally, bacterial fermentation of retained carbohydrates produces lactic acid, which further erodes the mucosa. This is NOT acid reflux oesophagitis (remember: the LES is too tight for acid to reflux up from the stomach).

- ***Candida oesophagitis***: The moist, stagnant, nutrient-rich oesophageal environment is an ideal culture medium for *Candida* species. The damaged squamous epithelium allows fungal adherence and invasion. Importantly, candida oesophagitis in achalasia can occur even in **immunocompetent** patients — it's the stasis, not immunosuppression, that drives it. On OGD, you'll see white adherent plaques on erythematous mucosa.

**Clinical significance**: Candida oesophagitis worsens dysphagia and odynophagia; erosions may cause chronic low-grade blood loss.

---

#### 2. ***Aspiration Pneumonia*** [2][3]

**Pathophysiology**: Regurgitated food, saliva, and fermented material from the dilated oesophagus spills into the airway, particularly during sleep when the patient is supine and protective laryngeal reflexes are diminished. The aspirated material causes:

- **Chemical pneumonitis**: from the acidic (fermented) oesophageal contents
- **Bacterial pneumonia**: oral and oesophageal flora (including anaerobes from fermented food) seed the lungs

***Aspiration can lead to resultant bronchitis and pneumonia*** [3]. This is one of the most clinically significant complications and can be the presenting feature of achalasia (patient referred to respiratory medicine for recurrent pneumonia before the oesophageal cause is identified).

**Pattern**: Typically affects the **right lower lobe** (the right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical than the left — aspirated material preferentially enters it) or bilateral lower lobes. Recurrent episodes lead to bronchiectasis.

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl" type="idea">
Any patient with **recurrent aspiration pneumonia** without an obvious cause (e.g., stroke, neurological disease) should have achalasia considered in the differential. Ask about dysphagia! A simple barium swallow or OGD may reveal the diagnosis.
</Callout>

#### 3. ***Lower Oesophageal Diverticula*** [2]

**Pathophysiology**: Chronic raised intraluminal pressure in the oesophagus (from aperistalsis + non-relaxing LES creating a closed system during attempted swallowing) causes the oesophageal wall to herniate outward at points of relative weakness. These are **pulsion diverticula** — "pulsion" because they are pushed out by pressure from within (as opposed to "traction" diverticula pulled out by external adhesions).

- Typically epiphrenic (just above the diaphragm) in the distal oesophagus
- The diverticula themselves become reservoirs for food stasis, worsening regurgitation and aspiration risk
- Rarely, they can perforate or develop mucosal ulceration

---

#### 4. ***Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)*** [2][3]

This is the most serious long-term complication and the reason for lifelong surveillance.

**Pathophysiology**: The cascade is: chronic food stasis → chronic mucosal irritation/inflammation → regenerative epithelial proliferation → metaplasia → dysplasia → squamous cell carcinoma.

- Estimated **~30× increased risk** compared to the general population
- Lifetime incidence: approximately **3%** of achalasia patients
- Typically develops **15–25 years** after symptom onset
- Location: usually in the **mid-oesophagus** (the maximally dilated segment, where stasis and mucosal contact with retained food is greatest) — this is different from typical SCC which favours the upper 2/3

***Achalasia increases risk of developing oesophageal cancer*** [3]. ***Achalasia is listed as a risk factor for oesophageal SCC*** alongside smoking, alcohol, hot drinks, Plummer-Vinson syndrome, and caustic injury [4][9].

**Why SCC and not adenocarcinoma?** The oesophagus is lined by **squamous epithelium**. The chronic irritation is from retained food and fermentation products (not acid reflux). There is no Barrett's metaplasia (which requires acid-mediated columnar metaplasia to progress to adenocarcinoma). The chronic irritation of squamous epithelium → squamous dysplasia → SCC.

<Callout title="Surveillance for SCC" type="error">
There is no universally agreed protocol, but most guidelines recommend **periodic OGD with quadrantic biopsies** starting approximately **10–15 years after achalasia diagnosis**, repeated every **1–3 years** depending on risk factors and local protocols. This is particularly important in Hong Kong where ***SCC is the most common oesophageal cancer (90%)*** [9].

#### 5. Malnutrition and Weight Loss

**Pathophysiology**: Progressive dysphagia → reduced oral intake → caloric deficit → weight loss → sarcopenia and micronutrient deficiencies. Chronic regurgitation causes further nutrient loss. Patients often self-restrict their diet to soft or liquid foods, which may be calorically insufficient.

**Clinical significance**: Significant weight loss (> 10 kg) should always prompt re-evaluation — is this from the achalasia itself, or could this be pseudoachalasia/malignancy?

---

#### 6. Sigmoid (Megaoesophagus) — End-Stage Disease

**Pathophysiology**: Years of chronic dilation → the oesophagus loses all residual tone and becomes massively dilated and tortuous, adopting an S-shaped configuration reminiscent of the sigmoid colon. At this stage:

- The oesophageal wall is thinned and atonic
- No treatment short of oesophagectomy will restore function
- Aspiration risk is extremely high
- Nutritional status is severely compromised

---

### B. Complications of Treatment

Each treatment modality carries specific complications, directly related to its mechanism of action.

---

#### 1. Complications of Pneumatic Dilation (PD)

| Complication | Mechanism | Incidence | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Perforation*** [2] | The balloon forcibly tears circular muscle — if the tear extends through the full wall thickness, free perforation results | 2–5% | Post-procedure water-soluble contrast swallow to detect; if free perforation → urgent surgical repair (thoracotomy + primary repair ± Dor patch) |
| ***GERD*** [2] | Over-disruption of LES muscle → LES becomes incompetent → acid reflux | 15–35% | PPI therapy; dietary/lifestyle measures |
| Haemorrhage | Mucosal tear at the dilation site | Rare | Usually self-limiting; endoscopic haemostasis if significant |
| Chest pain | Muscle fibre disruption; local inflammation | Common (transient) | Analgesics; self-resolving within 24–48 hours |

---

#### 2. Complications of Heller Myotomy

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Perforation (mucosal injury)*** [2] | During myotomy, the surgeon divides muscle fibres down to the submucosa; the thin mucosa can be inadvertently breached | Intraoperative recognition and primary repair; the Dor fundoplication covers the myotomy site as a protective patch |
| ***Dysphagia (due to fundoplication)*** [2] | The fundoplication wrap, even a partial one, adds some resistance at the GOJ; in an aperistaltic oesophagus, even modest resistance causes symptoms | ***50% in early post-op, 10% long-term*** [7]; investigate with water-soluble contrast swallow; treat with endoscopic balloon dilation or revision of fundoplication if persistent |
| **Post-operative GERD** | Myotomy disrupts the LES anti-reflux mechanism; if fundoplication wrap is too loose or slips → acid reflux | PPI therapy; if severe, revision fundoplication |
| **Incomplete myotomy** | Myotomy does not extend far enough distally onto the gastric cardia or does not fully divide all circular muscle fibres | Persistent dysphagia; treat with redo myotomy (POEM is excellent for salvage after failed Heller) or PD |
| **Vagus nerve injury** | Dissection around the GOJ can damage the vagal trunks | Delayed gastric emptying; treat with prokinetics; pyloric intervention if severe |

---

#### 3. Complications of POEM

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Reflux (GERD)*** [2] | ***No fundoplication is performed*** during POEM → the disrupted LES has no anti-reflux augmentation | ***Long-term PPI*** [2]; the most common and significant complication (~40–50%) |
| ***Mediastinitis*** [2] | Inadvertent full-thickness perforation or contamination of the mediastinum during submucosal tunnel creation | IV antibiotics; drainage; surgical exploration if severe |
| ***Surgical emphysema*** [2] | CO₂ used for insufflation during the endoscopic procedure tracks through the submucosal tunnel into the mediastinum and subcutaneous tissues | Usually self-limiting; decompression if causing haemodynamic compromise (tension capnomediastinum/capnopericardium) or respiratory distress |
| **Pneumoperitoneum** | CO₂ tracks through the oesophageal hiatus into the peritoneal cavity | Needle decompression if causing abdominal compartment syndrome; usually self-limiting |
| **Mucosal perforation** | Breach of mucosa during tunnel creation | Endoscopic clip closure; antibiotics |
| **Bleeding** | Injury to submucosal vessels during tunnel dissection | Endoscopic coagulation |

---

#### 4. Complications of Botox Injection

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **Submucosal fibrosis** | Repeated injections cause chronic inflammatory reaction → fibrosis in the submucosal plane; obliterates the surgical plane needed for future myotomy (Heller or POEM) |
| **Transient chest pain** | Local tissue reaction at injection site |
| **Rare mediastinitis** | Transmural injection or perforation |
| **Diminishing efficacy** | Antibody formation against botulinum toxin with repeated injections |

---

### Summary: Complications at a Glance

| Category | Complication | Pathophysiological Link |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Disease** | ***Erosions / Candida oesophagitis*** | Food stasis → mucosal irritation → fungal overgrowth |
| **Disease** | ***Aspiration pneumonia*** | Regurgitation of stagnant contents → airway contamination |
| **Disease** | ***Lower oesophageal diverticula*** | Raised intraluminal pressure → pulsion herniation |
| **Disease** | ***Oesophageal SCC*** | Chronic mucosal irritation → metaplasia → dysplasia → carcinoma |
| **Disease** | Malnutrition / weight loss | Chronic dysphagia → reduced oral intake |
| **Disease** | Sigmoid megaoesophagus | End-stage dilation and decompensation |
| **Treatment (PD)** | ***Perforation, GERD*** | Over-disruption of LES |
| **Treatment (Heller)** | ***Perforation, dysphagia, GERD*** | Mucosal injury; fundoplication resistance |
| **Treatment (POEM)** | ***Reflux, mediastinitis, surgical emphysema*** | No fundoplication; tunnel contamination; CO₂ tracking |
| **Treatment (Botox)** | Submucosal fibrosis | Repeated injection → chronic inflammation |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Disease complications** — all stem from chronic food stasis in a dilated, aperistaltic oesophagus above a non-relaxing LES:
- **Mucosal**: erosions, candida oesophagitis (stasis + irritation)
- **Respiratory**: aspiration pneumonia (regurgitated stagnant food into airway)
- **Structural**: lower oesophageal diverticula (raised intraluminal pressure), sigmoid megaoesophagus (end-stage)
- **Malignancy**: oesophageal SCC (~30× risk; develops after 15–25 years; needs long-term OGD surveillance)

**Treatment complications** — specific to modality:
- **PD**: perforation (2–5%), GERD
- **Heller myotomy**: mucosal perforation, dysphagia from fundoplication (50% early, 10% long-term), GERD
- **POEM**: GERD (40–50% — the major disadvantage; no fundoplication → needs PPI), mediastinitis, surgical emphysema
- **Botox**: submucosal fibrosis (complicates future myotomy)

**Cancer risk**: Achalasia is a recognised risk factor for oesophageal SCC. Surveillance with periodic OGD recommended from 10–15 years post-diagnosis.

Common basis: all stem from chronic food stasis in a dilated oesophagus due to aperistalsis and non-relaxing LES. Stasis causes mucosal irritation (erosions, candida), regurgitation with airway contamination (aspiration), raised intraluminal pressure (diverticula), and long-term mucosal inflammation leading to dysplasia and SCC."

      question: "Why does achalasia predispose to squamous cell carcinoma specifically, rather than adenocarcinoma? Where in the oesophagus does it typically arise?",
      markscheme: "The oesophagus is lined by squamous epithelium. Chronic irritation from retained food and bacterial fermentation products (not acid reflux) causes squamous cell inflammation, metaplasia, dysplasia, and eventually SCC. Adenocarcinoma requires Barrett's metaplasia (columnar change driven by acid reflux), which does not occur in achalasia (LES is too tight for reflux). SCC typically arises in the mid-oesophagus, the point of maximal stasis and dilation."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the most common complication of POEM and why does it occur? How is it managed?",
      markscheme: "GERD / acid reflux, occurring in approximately 40-50% of patients. It occurs because POEM involves myotomy of the LES via a submucosal tunnel but no anti-reflux fundoplication can be performed (unlike Heller myotomy which includes a Dor partial fundoplication). The disrupted LES without anti-reflux augmentation allows gastric acid to reflux freely. Managed with long-term PPI therapy."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is repeated Botox injection into the LES problematic for future definitive surgical treatment?",
      markscheme: "Repeated Botox injections cause progressive submucosal fibrosis at the LES due to chronic inflammatory reaction. This fibrosis obliterates the clean plane between mucosa and muscle layer that surgeons rely on during Heller myotomy or POEM. This makes future myotomy technically more difficult and increases the risk of inadvertent mucosal perforation. Therefore, Botox should be used only as a bridge in patients unfit for definitive therapy."
    },
    {
      question: "A patient develops subcutaneous crepitus in the neck 2 hours after POEM. What complication has occurred and what is the mechanism?",
      markscheme: "Surgical emphysema (subcutaneous emphysema). During POEM, CO2 is used for insufflation to create and maintain the submucosal tunnel. CO2 can track from the tunnel through the mediastinum and into the subcutaneous tissues of the neck, causing crepitus. Usually self-limiting as CO2 is rapidly absorbed. Requires monitoring; decompression only if causing haemodynamic compromise (tension capnomediastinum) or respiratory distress."
