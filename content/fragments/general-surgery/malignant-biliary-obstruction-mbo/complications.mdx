## Complications of Malignant Biliary Obstruction

Complications of MBO can be organised into three categories: (A) complications of the disease itself (i.e., what the biliary obstruction and cancer do to the patient), (B) complications of diagnostic/palliative interventions (stenting, PTBD, ERCP), and (C) complications of curative surgery. Each has a clear pathophysiological basis. Let's go through every one from first principles.

---

### 1. Complications of the Disease Itself

#### 1.1 Causes of Mortality in MBO

The lecture specifically highlights the three terminal pathways [9]:

> ***Cause of mortality in MBO:*** [9]
> - ***Biliary sepsis***
> - ***Cancer cachexia***
> - ***Liver failure***

These are not random — they arise directly from the pathophysiology of biliary obstruction combined with advanced malignancy.

#### 1.2 Biliary Sepsis (Acute Cholangitis)

**Why does it happen?**

Bile stasis from obstruction removes the normal protective mechanisms of the biliary tree — continuous flushing action, bacteriostatic bile salts, mucosal IgA, and the sphincter of Oddi barrier [13]. Bacteria ascend from the duodenum into the stagnant, obstructed bile. Once biliary pressure exceeds the secretory pressure of the hepatocytes (***normal ductal pressure: 7–14 cm H₂O; increased biliary pressure > 25 cm H₂O***), bacteria are forced into the hepatic venous and lymphatic system (cholangiovenous and cholangiolymphatic reflux), leading to ***bacteraemia and septic shock*** [29].

A critical additional point from the lecture: ***Excretion of antibiotics is impaired in biliary obstruction*** [29] — meaning even if you give IV antibiotics, they cannot concentrate in the obstructed bile where the infection is. This is why ***biliary drainage is mandatory*** [29] in cholangitis complicating MBO.

**Clinical features** [13]:
- ***Charcot's triad (50–70%)***: Fever, RUQ pain, jaundice
- ***Reynold's pentad ( < 10%)***: Charcot's triad + shock + altered mental status → indicates **suppurative cholangitis** (pus under pressure in bile duct) with multi-organ failure

**Common organisms** [13]:
- Gram-negative: *E. coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Enterobacter* spp., *Bacteroides fragilis*
- Gram-positive: *Enterococcus* spp.
- If stent present: *Pseudomonas* (biofilm on foreign body)

<Callout title="Why is Cholangitis in MBO Especially Dangerous?">
Three synergistic factors:
1. **Impaired immune system** — biliary obstruction suppresses reticuloendothelial (Kupffer cell) function and cell-mediated immunity [24] [30]
2. **Impaired antibiotic delivery** — antibiotics are secreted into bile; obstructed bile ducts cannot concentrate antibiotics at the site of infection [29]
3. **Continuous bacterial source** — the stagnant bile above the obstruction serves as a perpetual culture medium; until the obstruction is drained, infection cannot be eradicated
</Callout>

#### 1.3 Cancer Cachexia

**Why does it happen?**

Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome driven by:
- **Tumour-derived cytokines** (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1) → systemic inflammation → skeletal muscle proteolysis → wasting
- **Anorexia** — central appetite suppression from cytokines
- **Fat malabsorption** — bile salts cannot reach the gut → impaired emulsification of dietary fat → steatorrhoea → caloric loss
- **Impaired protein synthesis** — cholestatic liver has reduced synthetic capacity → hypoalbuminaemia, muscle wasting

***Cancer cachexia → malnutrition*** is explicitly listed as a reason MBO is high-risk for surgery [24].

#### 1.4 Liver Failure

**Why does it happen?**

Prolonged obstruction of bile flow has progressive hepatotoxic effects:
- **Bile acid cytotoxicity** — retained bile acids (hydrophobic bile acids like lithocholic acid) are directly toxic to hepatocyte membranes, causing apoptosis and necrosis
- **Secondary biliary cirrhosis** — chronic obstruction → periportal fibrosis → eventually cirrhosis
- **Endotoxaemia** — Kupffer cells are dysfunctional → gut-derived endotoxins enter systemic circulation → further hepatocyte injury
- ***Impaired gluconeogenesis*** and ***impaired ketogenesis*** [30] — the cholestatic liver cannot adequately perform its metabolic functions, leading to metabolic decompensation

#### 1.5 Renal Failure (Cholemic Nephrosis)

**Why does it happen?**
- Conjugated bilirubin and bile salts are directly **nephrotoxic** — they cause tubular necrosis
- Endotoxaemia causes **renal vasoconstriction** → reduced renal perfusion
- Dehydration (poor oral intake, vomiting from GOO)
- Historical studies showed: ***higher anastomotic leak, haemorrhage, and renal failure*** in jaundiced patients undergoing surgery [31]

This is why the lecture specifically lists ***mannitol, dopamine to prevent renal failure*** as one of the measures to reduce surgical complications [32].

#### 1.6 Coagulopathy

**Why does it happen?**
***Impaired clotting factor synthesis*** [30]:
- Vitamin K (fat-soluble) cannot be absorbed without bile salts in the gut
- Vitamin K is a cofactor for hepatic synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, X (and protein C, S)
- → Prolonged PT/INR → increased bleeding risk

#### 1.7 Immune Dysfunction

***Pathophysiological effects of malignant biliary obstruction:*** [30]
> - ***Endotoxaemia***
> - ***↓ Reticuloendothelial function***
> - ***↓ Cell-mediated immunity***

This creates a state of **functional immunosuppression** — the patient is vulnerable to infection (not just biliary, but also wound infections, pneumonia, urinary infections post-operatively).

#### 1.8 Metabolic Derangements [30]

| Deranged Function | Mechanism | Clinical Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| ***Impaired protein synthesis*** | Cholestatic liver → reduced hepatocyte function | Hypoalbuminaemia, oedema, poor wound healing |
| ***Impaired clotting factor synthesis*** | Vitamin K malabsorption + reduced hepatic synthesis | Coagulopathy, bleeding tendency |
| ***Impaired gluconeogenesis*** | Liver unable to generate glucose from non-carbohydrate sources | Hypoglycaemia (especially during perioperative fasting) |
| ***Impaired ketogenesis*** | Liver unable to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids | Cannot provide alternative fuel substrate during starvation → metabolic decompensation |

#### 1.9 Gastric Outlet Obstruction (GOO)

Occurs specifically with **CA head of pancreas** — the tumour compresses both the CBD (causing jaundice) AND the duodenum (causing GOO) [5]. Presents with non-bilious projectile vomiting of undigested food, early satiety, weight loss, and succussion splash on examination.

#### 1.10 Acute Pancreatitis

Can occur when tumour obstructs the main pancreatic duct (especially in periampullary or pancreatic head cancers) → back-pressure → premature activation of pancreatic enzymes → autodigestion [7].

---

### 2. Complications of Diagnostic and Palliative Interventions

#### 2.1 Complications of ERCP [27] [5]

ERCP is the workhorse intervention for MBO, but it carries significant procedural risks:

| Complication | Incidence | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Post-ERCP pancreatitis** | ~5–7% | Trauma to papilla / pancreatic duct orifice during cannulation → pancreatic duct oedema → impaired outflow → autodigestion | Conservative (NPO, IV fluids, analgesia); prophylactic rectal indomethacin reduces risk |
| **Ascending cholangitis / sepsis** | ~1% | Injection of contrast into obstructed system → bacteria forced into bloodstream; stent blockage → stasis → infection | IV antibiotics; re-drainage (stent exchange or PTBD) |
| ***Post-sphincterotomy bleeding*** | ~2% [27] | Cutting of sphincter of Oddi involves cutting across the biliopancreatic septum which contains branches of the retroduodenal artery | Endoscopic haemostasis (adrenaline injection, clip); correct coagulopathy |
| **Perforation** | ~1% [27] | Sphincterotomy extends beyond the intramural CBD into the retroperitoneal space; or scope-related duodenal perforation | Conservative management if contained; surgical repair if free perforation |
| **Cholecystitis** | Uncommon | Stent occluding cystic duct orifice → bile stasis in GB → infection | Antibiotics ± percutaneous cholecystostomy |

#### 2.2 Complications of Biliary Stenting [5] [3]

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Stent occlusion*** | ***Sludge / tumour ingrowth / tumour overgrowth*** [5] — bile sludge forms biofilm on stent; uncovered metal stents allow tumour to grow through the mesh interstices; tumour overgrowth at stent ends | ***Managed by sweeping or placing a new stent*** [3]; if recurrent, consider surgical bypass |
| ***Stent migration*** [3] | Peristalsis or inadequate anchoring can displace the stent proximally or distally | Endoscopic retrieval and replacement |
| **Cholangitis** | Occluded stent → bile stasis → bacterial overgrowth | Stent exchange; IV antibiotics |
| **Cholecystitis** | Stent covering the cystic duct orifice (especially with covered SEMS) | ***Uncovered stents preferred: lower risk of occluding branches of biliary system*** [3] |

***Plastic vs Metallic stent patency*** [33]:
> - ***Metal stents: 15–39 weeks patency***
> - ***Plastic stents: 7–20 weeks patency***
> - ***Metallic stents have significantly less recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death*** [33]

#### 2.3 Complications of PTBD [5]

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Cholangitis / biliary sepsis*** | Introducing bacteria during percutaneous puncture; ascending infection through the catheter tract; ***antibiotic prophylaxis required*** [5] | IV antibiotics; catheter exchange |
| ***Haemobilia*** | ***Communication of the percutaneous tract with a major vascular structure*** [5] — hepatic artery or portal vein punctured during the percutaneous approach through the liver (the portal triad lies at the hilum) | ***Stabilise and resuscitate → clamp PTBD catheter → perform cholangiogram via PTBD to identify whether catheter is in hepatic artery or portal vein → remove catheter slowly; do NOT remove immediately (converts to free haemoperitoneum)*** [5] |
| **Fluid and electrolyte loss** | External drainage diverts bile (containing sodium, chloride, bicarbonate) outside the body → dehydration, hyponatraemia, metabolic acidosis | Monitor daily output and replace losses IV; consider conversion to internal-external drainage |
| **Catheter dislodgement** | Movement or inadequate fixation | Re-insertion under fluoroscopic guidance |
| **Bile leak / biliary peritonitis** | Bile leaks around the catheter site into the peritoneal cavity | Catheter adjustment; drainage of peritoneal collection |
| **Pleural transgression** | Right-sided PTBD → intercostal approach may cross the pleural space → pneumothorax or pleural effusion | ***Left hepatic duct preferred because the subcostal route is less painful and less likely to transgress the pleural space*** [5] |

#### 2.4 Complications of Pre-operative Biliary Drainage [31] [34]

The lecture specifically highlights this debate:

> ***Pre-op biliary drainage has increased risk of serious complications:*** [34]
> - ***Pancreatitis (7%), cholangitis (26%), blocked stent (15%), bleeding (2%), perforation (2%)***
> - ***Surgery-related complications were comparable*** (with or without pre-op drainage)
> - ***Routine pre-op biliary drainage in patients undergoing surgery for CA pancreas increases rate of complications*** [34]

**The jaundice itself** also causes problems if left undrained [31]:
> ***Jaundice → coagulopathy, malabsorption, malnutrition, and immune dysfunction → higher anastomotic leak, haemorrhage, and renal failure*** [31]

This creates a **therapeutic dilemma** — drain (and risk procedure-related complications) vs. don't drain (and risk cholestasis-related complications). As discussed in the management section, the practical QMH approach is to drain all patients because surgery cannot be performed early [5].

---

### 3. Complications of Curative Surgery

#### 3.1 Post-Whipple (Pancreaticoduodenectomy) Complications

Historical data shows MBO carries a very high operative mortality [35]:

> ***Malignant biliary obstruction postoperative mortality:*** [35]
> - ***Nakayama 1978: 28%***
> - ***Dixon 1983: 26%***
> - ***Lai 1992: 27%***

Modern mortality at high-volume centres is now 2–5%, but morbidity remains substantial (30–50%).

##### Early Complications [7] [14]

| Complication | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Anastomotic leak** | Three anastomoses are at risk; ***Risk: PJ (30%) > CJ > GJ*** [14] — because pancreatic juice contains digestive enzymes (trypsin, lipase, amylase) that erode the anastomosis, and the pancreatic duct is often small and soft | ***Severe PJ leak may require distal pancreatectomy*** [14]; ***Somatostatin analogue (e.g., octreotide) does NOT reduce risk*** [14] |
| ***Pancreatic fistula*** (most common major complication) | ***Abnormal connection between the pancreas and adjacent structures*** [14]; ***Post-op definition: drain output of any volume after post-op Day 3 with drain amylase > 3× ULN*** [14] | Risk factors: ***high BMI, soft pancreas, narrow duct*** [14] |
| **Delayed gastric emptying (DGE)** | Common after PPPD; mechanisms: ***injury to nerve of Latarjet*** (vagal branch supplying antrum/pylorus), ***disrupted pacemaker cells*** (interstitial cells of Cajal in duodenum removed), ***reduced CCK*** (high concentration found in duodenum — duodenum resected) [14] | Treated with prokinetics (metoclopramide, erythromycin); NG drainage if severe |
| **Intra-abdominal haemorrhage** | Erosion of GDA stump pseudoaneurysm by pancreatic juice from a fistula; or surgical bleeding | ***GDA pseudoaneurysm → intraabdominal haemorrhage / UGIB*** [14]; requires angiographic embolisation or surgical haemostasis |
| ***Intra-abdominal abscess / wound infection*** | Anastomotic leak → contamination → abscess; immunosuppression from MBO (impaired cell-mediated immunity) | CT-guided percutaneous drainage; IV antibiotics |
| **Post-operative renal failure** | Cholemic nephrosis + hypovolaemia + sepsis | ***Mannitol, dopamine to prevent renal failure*** [32] |
| **Multi-organ failure** | Cascade from sepsis (leak → abscess → bacteraemia → SIRS → MOF) | ICU support; may be fatal |

***Measures to reduce complications related to surgery for MBO:*** [32]
> 1. ***Nutritional support***
> 2. ***Vitamin K***
> 3. ***FFP during surgery***
> 4. ***Antibiotic cover***
> 5. ***Mannitol, dopamine to prevent renal failure***
> 6. ***H₂ antagonist***

**Why H₂ antagonist?** [32] Patients undergoing major HPB surgery are at high risk of stress ulceration — the combination of physiological stress, fasting, and potential ICU admission creates a perfect storm for gastric acid hypersecretion and mucosal ischaemia. H₂ blockers (ranitidine) or PPIs reduce this risk.

##### Late Complications [7] [14]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Exocrine insufficiency → malabsorption and steatorrhoea*** | Removal of pancreatic head → reduced pancreatic enzyme output → fat maldigestion. Managed with ***pancreatic enzyme replacement*** (Creon) [14] |
| ***Endocrine insufficiency → diabetes mellitus*** | Removal of pancreatic head → loss of islet cells. ***New-onset DM in 16% post-Whipple*** [14]. Managed with ***OHA / insulin*** [14] |
| **Gastric stasis** | Especially post-PPPD (pylorus preserved but denervated) |
| **Dumping syndrome** | After standard Whipple (partial gastrectomy) — rapid gastric emptying of hyperosmolar chyme into jejunum → fluid shifts → vasomotor symptoms |
| **Marginal ulceration** | Anastomotic ulcer at gastrojejunostomy site — from loss of duodenal buffering + acid exposure |
| **Bile reflux gastritis** | If gastrojejunostomy allows reflux of bile into the gastric remnant |

##### Pancreatic Fistula — In Detail [14]

This deserves special attention because it is the most feared complication after pancreatic surgery:

**Classification (International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula — ISGPF)** [14]:

| Grade | Definition | Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Biochemical leak** | ***Drain amylase > 3× ULN but asymptomatic*** | Observation; drain when output diminishes |
| **Grade B** | ***Persistent drainage > 3 weeks, requiring change in management, signs of infection but no organ failure*** | Antibiotics; CT-guided drainage; TPN |
| **Grade C** | ***Unstable, requires re-operation, risk of organ failure*** | Surgical re-exploration; may need completion pancreatectomy |

**Downstream consequences of pancreatic fistula** [14]:
- ***Pseudocyst*** — walled-off collection of pancreatic juice
- ***High-output fistula*** → dehydration, malnutrition, metabolic acidosis (loss of HCO₃⁻ in pancreatic juice)
- ***GDA pseudoaneurysm*** → intraabdominal haemorrhage / UGIB (pancreatic enzymes erode the GDA stump)
- ***Portal vein thrombosis / Splenic vein thrombosis*** (peripancreatic inflammation)
- ***Pancreatic ascites*** (leak into peritoneal cavity)

#### 3.2 Post-Hepatectomy Complications (for Klatskin Tumour / Intrahepatic CC)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF)** | Inadequate future liver remnant (FLR) → insufficient hepatocyte mass to maintain synthetic, metabolic, and excretory functions. This is why ***bilirubin must be < 20 µmol/L before hepatectomy*** [25] and ***PVE is performed if FLR is inadequate*** [3] |
| **Bile leak** | From the cut surface of the liver or from the hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis |
| **Intra-abdominal haemorrhage** | Raw cut surface of liver; vascular pedicle bleeding |
| **Subphrenic / perihepatic abscess** | Bile leak → secondary infection; dead space after resection |
| **Portal vein thrombosis** | Sluggish flow in the residual portal system post-resection; hypercoagulable state from malignancy |

#### 3.3 Post-Cholecystectomy Complications (for CA Gallbladder)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Bile duct injury** | Especially during radical cholecystectomy near the hepatoduodenal ligament |
| **Bile leak from liver bed** | Raw surface after wedge resection of segments IVb/V |
| **Port-site recurrence** | ***Open approach recommended*** because laparoscopic bile spillage can seed port sites [10] |
| **Peritoneal recurrence** | Bile spillage during surgery disseminates tumour cells |

### 4. Complications Summary — Organised by Pathophysiology

| Pathophysiological Basis | Complications |
|---|---|
| **Biliary stasis + loss of barrier** | Cholangitis, biliary sepsis, liver abscess |
| **Bile acid toxicity** | Hepatocyte necrosis → liver failure; cholemic nephrosis → renal failure |
| **Fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption** | Coagulopathy (Vit K), osteomalacia (Vit D), night blindness (Vit A) |
| **Cancer cachexia + malnutrition** | Poor wound healing, immunosuppression, muscle wasting, death |
| **Tumour local effects** | GOO (duodenal compression), pancreatitis (pancreatic duct obstruction), portal vein thrombosis (venous invasion) |
| **Metastatic complications** | Liver failure (hepatic metastases), ascites (peritoneal carcinomatosis), pathological fractures (bone metastases), respiratory failure (lung metastases) |
| **Procedure-related** | ERCP: pancreatitis, bleeding, cholangitis, perforation. PTBD: haemobilia, sepsis, fluid loss. Stent: occlusion, migration |
| **Surgery-related** | Anastomotic leak (PJ > CJ > GJ), pancreatic fistula, DGE, PHLF, bile leak, haemorrhage, renal failure |

---

### 5. Prognosis

The prognosis of MBO depends entirely on the underlying malignancy, but overall it is grim [7]:

| Cancer | Prognosis |
|---|---|
| **CA pancreas** | ***Highly lethal malignancy*** [7]; only 8% diagnosed at localised stage; ***5-year survival after Whipple: 25–30% (node-negative), 10% (node-positive)*** [7]; ***Median survival for unresectable locally advanced disease: 12 months; metastatic disease: 6 months*** [7] |
| **Cholangiocarcinoma** | Only 10% operable at presentation [3]; 5-year survival after R0 resection: 20–40% |
| **CA gallbladder** | ***Very poor prognosis: most discovered late and unresectable at diagnosis — 5-year OS < 5%*** [10] |
| **CA ampulla** | Best prognosis among periampullary CAs (presents earliest); 5-year survival after Whipple: 40–60% |
| **HCC** | Variable depending on stage; BCLC staging guides treatment |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. ***Causes of mortality in MBO: biliary sepsis, cancer cachexia, liver failure*** [9].

2. **Biliary sepsis** arises from bile stasis + loss of biliary barrier + immunosuppression. ***Antibiotic excretion is impaired in biliary obstruction → biliary drainage is mandatory*** [29]. Normal biliary pressure 7–14 cmH₂O; when > 25 cmH₂O → cholangiovenous/lymphatic reflux → bacteraemia.

3. ***Pathophysiological effects of MBO***: Impaired protein synthesis, impaired clotting factor synthesis, impaired gluconeogenesis, impaired ketogenesis, endotoxaemia, ↓ reticuloendothelial function, ↓ cell-mediated immunity [30].

4. ***Six measures to reduce surgical complications in MBO***: (1) Nutritional support, (2) Vitamin K, (3) FFP during surgery, (4) Antibiotic cover, (5) Mannitol + dopamine to prevent renal failure, (6) H₂ antagonist [32].

5. **Stent complications**: Occlusion (sludge, tumour ingrowth, tumour overgrowth), migration, cholangitis/cholecystitis [5] [3]. ***Metal stents last 15–39 weeks; plastic 7–20 weeks*** [33].

6. **PTBD complications**: Cholangitis/biliary sepsis, ***haemobilia*** (do NOT remove catheter immediately if bleeding — clamp → cholangiogram → slow removal) [5].

7. **Post-Whipple**: Anastomotic leak (***PJ 30% > CJ > GJ***), pancreatic fistula (drain amylase > 3× ULN after Day 3), DGE, GDA pseudoaneurysm haemorrhage [14]. ***Octreotide does NOT reduce pancreatic fistula risk*** [14].

8. ***Historical post-op mortality for MBO was ~26–28%*** [35]; modern mortality at high-volume centres is 2–5% but morbidity remains 30–50%.

9. **Prognosis**: Pancreatic CA is highly lethal — ***5-year survival 25–30% (node-negative Whipple), 10% (node-positive); median survival 12 months (locally advanced), 6 months (metastatic)*** [7].
