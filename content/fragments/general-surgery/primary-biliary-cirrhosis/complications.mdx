## Complications of Primary Biliary Cholangitis

### Organising Framework

Complications of PBC fall into two categories, exactly as the exam expects you to present them [1]:

1. **General complications of cirrhosis** — these occur once PBC has progressed to Stage 4 (cirrhosis) and are identical to complications of cirrhosis from *any* aetiology
2. **Specific complications of PBC** — unique to the cholestatic and autoimmune nature of PBC itself, and can occur *before* cirrhosis develops

Understanding this distinction is important because it tells you when to expect each complication and how to monitor for it. A patient with early PBC (Stage 1–2) may have severe pruritus and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency but will NOT have ascites or varices. A patient with PBC cirrhosis (Stage 4) can have ALL complications.

### Part A: General Complications of Cirrhosis

These occur when PBC progresses to **Stage 4 (cirrhosis)** [1]. The pathophysiology is the same as cirrhosis from any cause — the key driver is **architectural distortion of the liver** causing increased intrahepatic vascular resistance → **portal hypertension** → a cascade of downstream consequences, combined with **hepatocellular failure** → reduced synthetic and metabolic function.

#### 1. Portal Hypertension

Portal hypertension is the haemodynamic consequence of cirrhosis and is the root cause of most cirrhotic complications.

**Why does PBC cause portal hypertension?**
- Progressive fibrosis → regenerative nodules compress sinusoids and hepatic venules → increased intrahepatic vascular resistance
- Activated hepatic stellate cells contract around sinusoids → further increases resistance
- Portal pressure gradient > 5 mmHg = portal hypertension; > 10 mmHg = clinically significant (varices form); > 12 mmHg = variceal bleeding risk

##### a. Ascites

***Abdominal distension from ascites*** [1]

- **Pathophysiology**: Portal hypertension → splanchnic vasodilation (NO-mediated) → reduced effective arterial blood volume → RAAS activation + ADH secretion → sodium and water retention → fluid transudation into peritoneal cavity. Simultaneously, hypoalbuminaemia (reduced hepatic synthesis) reduces plasma oncotic pressure → further fluid shift.
- **Clinical correlation**: The case study patient had ***progressive abdominal swelling, which was only partially controlled by diuretics*** [1], requiring ***repeated hospital admission for paracentesis*** [1] — this represents refractory ascites, a transplant indication.
- **Complications of ascites**: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), abdominal discomfort, respiratory compromise, umbilical hernia
- **Management**: Sodium restriction, spironolactone ± furosemide, large-volume paracentesis with albumin replacement, TIPS for refractory cases, transplant

##### b. Variceal Bleeding

***Haematemesis from oesophageal variceal bleeding*** [1]

- **Pathophysiology**: Portal hypertension → blood seeks alternative routes to bypass the liver → portosystemic collaterals develop at sites of portal-systemic anastomosis:
  - **Oesophageal/gastric varices** (left gastric vein → oesophageal veins → azygos system)
  - **Rectal varices** (superior rectal → middle/inferior rectal veins)
  - **Caput medusae** (recanalised umbilical vein → epigastric veins)
  - **Retroperitoneal collaterals**
- Oesophageal varices are thin-walled and under high pressure → rupture → massive UGIB → haematemesis and/or melaena
- **Mortality**: 15–20% per bleeding episode, even with modern treatment
- **Surveillance**: OGD screening when cirrhosis diagnosed; repeat 1–3 yearly
- **Management**: Non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol/carvedilol) for primary prophylaxis; endoscopic band ligation + terlipressin for acute bleeding; TIPS if refractory

##### c. Splenomegaly and Hypersplenism

- **Pathophysiology**: Portal hypertension → congestion of splenic vein → splenic engorgement → splenomegaly → excessive sequestration and destruction of blood cells in the enlarged spleen → **pancytopenia** (thrombocytopenia most prominent, then leukopenia, then anaemia)
- Reduced thrombopoietin production by the diseased liver also contributes to thrombocytopenia

#### 2. Hepatic Encephalopathy

***Confusion from hepatic encephalopathy*** [1]

**Pathophysiology**: Two mechanisms work in concert:
1. **Hepatocellular failure** → liver cannot metabolise ammonia (via urea cycle) → hyperammonaemia
2. **Portosystemic shunting** → gut-derived toxins (ammonia, mercaptans, short-chain fatty acids, GABA-like substances) bypass the liver entirely via collaterals → reach the systemic circulation and cross the blood-brain barrier

Ammonia (NH₃) is lipophilic → crosses BBB → converted to glutamine by astrocytes → osmotic astrocyte swelling → cerebral oedema → impaired neurotransmission

**Clinical features** [1]:
- ***Drowsy to comatose*** [1]
- ***Flapping tremor (asterixis)*** [1] — caused by sudden involuntary loss of muscle tone during sustained posture; reflects impaired motor neuron function from neurotoxins
- ***Fetor hepaticus*** [1] — sweet, musty odour on breath from dimethyl sulphide, a mercaptan that is normally metabolised by the liver
- Constructional apraxia, day-night reversal, personality change (early)

**Grading (West Haven criteria)**:
- Grade 0: Subclinical (detectable only on psychometric testing)
- Grade 1: Mild confusion, altered sleep
- Grade 2: Drowsy, inappropriate behaviour, asterixis
- Grade 3: Somnolent but arousable, gross disorientation
- Grade 4: Coma

***Precipitating factors*** [1]:
- ***↑ Protein intake*** [1]
- ***GI bleeding*** [1] — provides a massive protein (haemoglobin) load to the gut
- ***Constipation*** [1] — prolongs ammonia absorption from gut
- ***Infection (especially SBP)*** [1]
- ***Over-diuresis*** [1] — hypovolaemia, hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis (alkalotic pH favours NH₃ over NH₄⁺ → more ammonia crosses BBB)
- ***Inappropriate paracentesis without adequate albumin infusion*** [1]
- ***Shunting procedures including TIPS*** [1]
- ***Drugs — hypnotics*** [1]

**The case study illustrates this perfectly**: the patient ***became drowsy after celebrating her daughter's marriage*** [1] — likely precipitated by increased protein intake at the celebration → diagnosed with ***"liver coma"*** [1] → managed with ***low protein diet and laxatives (lactulose)*** [1].

**Management** [1]:
- ***IV Dextrose drip — provide adequate calorie intake to prevent protein breakdown*** [1]
- ***Oral Lactulose — inducing bowel movements 2–4 times per day*** [1]
- Lactulose mechanism: ***Non-absorbable disaccharide → osmotic laxative → acidifies colonic pH → converts NH₃ to NH₄⁺ (trapped, non-absorbable) → faecal excretion*** [1]
- Rifaximin (non-absorbable antibiotic) — reduces ammonia-producing gut bacteria; used for secondary prophylaxis
- ***Identify and treat precipitating factor*** [1]

#### 3. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS)

- **Pathophysiology**: Advanced cirrhosis → severe splanchnic vasodilation → arterial underfilling → intense renal vasoconstriction (RAAS, sympathetic nervous system, ADH) → functional renal failure with structurally normal kidneys
- **Type 1 (HRS-AKI)**: Rapid deterioration (doubling of creatinine in < 2 weeks); often triggered by SBP; very poor prognosis without transplant
- **Type 2 (HRS-CKD)**: Slower progression; associated with refractory ascites
- **Management**: IV albumin + terlipressin (splanchnic vasoconstrictor → reverses the underfilling); definitive treatment is transplant

#### 4. Coagulopathy

- **Pathophysiology**: The liver synthesises virtually ALL coagulation factors (except vWF, which is endothelial, and factor VIII). In cirrhosis:
  - Reduced synthesis of factors II, V, VII, IX, X, fibrinogen
  - Reduced synthesis of natural anticoagulants (protein C, protein S, antithrombin) — so cirrhosis is actually a *rebalanced* haemostatic state, not simply "anticoagulated"
  - Vitamin K malabsorption (from cholestasis) further reduces factors II, VII, IX, X specifically
  - Thrombocytopenia from hypersplenism
- **Clinical manifestation**: Easy bruising, prolonged PT/INR, increased bleeding risk from procedures

#### 5. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

***Patients with PBC and cirrhosis are at increased risk of HCC*** [1][2].

- **Pathophysiology**: Cirrhosis of any cause creates a pro-carcinogenic environment — chronic inflammation → regenerative nodules → dysplastic nodules → hepatocellular carcinoma. The cycle of cell death, inflammation, and regeneration → accumulation of somatic mutations → malignant transformation.
- PBC is listed as an autoimmune cause of cirrhosis leading to HCC, alongside AIH and PSC [2][9].
- ***Any cause of cirrhosis: infection (HBV, HCV), metabolic (ALD, NAFLD, Wilson's disease), immune (PBC, PSC)*** [2] can lead to HCC.
- **Risk**: Lower than HBV/HCV-related cirrhosis (~4% lifetime in PBC cirrhosis vs ~20–30% in HBV cirrhosis), but still significant enough to warrant surveillance
- **Surveillance**: AFP + USS every 6 months in all PBC patients with established cirrhosis
- HCC in PBC tends to present later in the disease course (only after cirrhosis is established), unlike HBV where HCC can occur without cirrhosis

<Callout title="HCC Risk in PBC — Don't Forget Surveillance" type="error">
A common oversight: students remember to screen for HCC in HBV/HCV cirrhosis but forget that ***PBC cirrhosis also carries HCC risk*** [1][2]. Once a PBC patient reaches Stage 4 (cirrhosis), they need the same AFP + USS surveillance every 6 months as any other cirrhotic patient.
</Callout>

#### 6. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)

- **Pathophysiology**: Ascites provides a culture medium for bacteria. In cirrhosis, gut barrier function is impaired (portal hypertensive enteropathy) + immune dysfunction (reduced complement, opsonisation defects) → bacterial translocation from gut to ascitic fluid → SBP
- **Organisms**: Most commonly E. coli, Klebsiella, Streptococcus pneumoniae (monomicrobial)
- **Diagnosis**: Ascitic fluid PMN count ≥ 250/mm³
- **Treatment**: IV ceftriaxone or cefotaxime + IV albumin
- ***SBP is a precipitant of hepatic encephalopathy*** [1] and a transplant indication [1]

---

### Part B: PBC-Specific Complications

These are complications that arise from the **cholestatic nature** of PBC itself and can occur at **any stage**, including before cirrhosis develops. They are unique to PBC (and other cholestatic diseases) rather than being generic cirrhotic complications.

#### 1. Pruritus

***Pruritus*** [1]

- **Pathophysiology**: Cholestasis → accumulation of pruritogens in blood and skin. The key mediators are now understood to include:
  - **Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)** — produced by the enzyme **autotaxin** (ATX); serum ATX levels correlate best with itch severity
  - **Bile acids** — activate TGR5 receptors on cutaneous sensory nerve fibres → itch signalling
  - **Endogenous opioids** — cholestasis upregulates opioidergic tone → opioid-mediated itch (explains why opioid antagonists help)
  - **Histamine** — may play a minor role, but antihistamines are generally ineffective in cholestatic pruritus (this is NOT histamine-mediated itch)
- **Clinical features**: Worst at night, can precede jaundice by months to years, may be so severe as to cause excoriations and sleep deprivation → quality of life impairment that alone can justify transplant listing
- **Management**: Stepwise — cholestyramine → rifampicin → naltrexone → IBAT inhibitors → transplant (covered in detail in the Management section)

<Callout title="Pruritus Is Not Just a Symptom — It's a Complication">
Pruritus in PBC deserves special emphasis because it can be the **most debilitating** aspect of the disease. Unlike pruritus from dermatological causes, cholestatic pruritus does NOT respond to antihistamines (because the mechanism involves autotaxin/LPA and opioid pathways, NOT histamine). Don't prescribe cetirizine and hope for the best — use the specific cholestatic itch ladder.
</Callout>

#### 2. Steatorrhoea and Fat-Soluble Vitamin Deficiency

***Steatorrhoea (malabsorption of dietary fat) and vitamin deficiency*** [1]

**Pathophysiology** — trace this from first principles:

1. PBC destroys bile ducts → **cholestasis** → reduced bile acid secretion into duodenum
2. Bile acids are essential for **micellar solubilisation** of dietary fat (long-chain triglycerides and fat-soluble vitamins)
3. Without micelles → fat cannot be absorbed across the intestinal epithelium → **steatorrhoea** (pale, bulky, foul-smelling, floating stools)
4. Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) are co-absorbed with fat in micelles → **malabsorption of all four fat-soluble vitamins**

***Lipid malabsorption — result of decreased biliary secretion of bile acids*** [1]

***Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K deficiency*** [1]:
- ***Vitamin A and D deficiency are more common requiring supplementation*** [1]
- ***Measurement of serum vitamin A and calcidiol is required*** [1]

| Vitamin | Consequence of Deficiency | Why This Vitamin Is Specifically Affected | Screening/Monitoring |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** (Retinol) | Night blindness, xerophthalmia, immune dysfunction | Requires micelles for absorption; liver stores eventually depleted | Serum retinol |
| **D** (Cholecalciferol) | Osteomalacia (bone softening), contributes to osteoporosis, muscle weakness | Requires micelles; also liver hydroxylation (25-OH-D) may be impaired in advanced disease | ***Serum calcidiol (25-OH-vitamin D)*** [1] |
| **E** (α-Tocopherol) | Peripheral neuropathy, spinocerebellar ataxia, haemolytic anaemia (rare) | Requires micelles; body stores are limited | Serum α-tocopherol |
| **K** (Phylloquinone) | Coagulopathy — ↑ PT/INR, easy bruising, bleeding | Requires micelles; very limited body stores (days to weeks) | PT/INR; response to parenteral vitamin K |

**Mnemonic — Fat-soluble vitamins**: **"A, D, E, K"** — "**A** **D**ark, **E**mpty **K**itchen" (A = vision/dark adaptation, D = bones, E = nerves, K = Koagulation)

#### 3. Hepatic Osteodystrophy

***Hepatic osteodystrophy (Osteopenia/Osteoporosis/Osteomalacia)*** [1]

***Metabolic bone disease includes osteopenia and osteoporosis or rarely osteomalacia*** [1]

**Pathophysiology** — this is a "double hit" mechanism:

1. **Osteoporosis** (reduced bone formation): ***Characteristic bone disorder in primary biliary cirrhosis which reflects the inhibitory effect of a retained toxin on the osteoblast which prevents it from functioning normally*** [1]. Retained bile acids, bilirubin, and other cholestatic toxins directly inhibit osteoblast activity → reduced bone formation → osteoporosis. This is the dominant mechanism in PBC.

2. **Osteomalacia** (defective mineralisation): Vitamin D malabsorption → reduced calcium absorption from gut → inadequate mineralisation of osteoid → soft bones. This is less common because most patients receive vitamin D supplementation, but it can occur if supplementation is inadequate.

**Clinical consequences**: Vertebral compression fractures, hip fractures, chronic bone pain, kyphosis
**Prevalence**: Osteoporosis occurs in 20–45% of PBC patients; increases with disease duration
**Risk factors for worse bone disease**: Post-menopausal women (oestrogen withdrawal + PBC effects = compounded risk), advanced cholestasis, low BMI, smoking, corticosteroid use (if overlap syndrome)

**Management** [1]:
- DEXA scan at diagnosis and every 2–3 years
- ***Calcium and vitamin D supplementation*** [1]
- ***Bisphosphonates — example: Alendronate*** [1] (if T-score ≤ −2.5 or fracture history)
- IV zoledronic acid if oesophageal varices contraindicate oral bisphosphonates
- Weight-bearing exercise, falls prevention

#### 4. Hyperlipidaemia

***Hyperlipidaemia*** [1]

***Increased cholesterol level in PBC do not increase atherosclerotic risk*** [1]

**Pathophysiology**:
- Bile is the major excretory route for cholesterol. Cholestasis → impaired cholesterol excretion → accumulation in blood
- Additionally, lipoprotein metabolism is altered: increased HDL, appearance of **lipoprotein-X (Lp-X)** — an abnormal lipoprotein unique to cholestasis
- Lp-X is measured by some assays as "LDL" but is NOT atherogenic
- ***Majority are elevation of HDL and lipoprotein-X which are anti-atherogenic*** [1]

**Clinical features**: Xanthelasma (yellowish periorbital plaques), xanthomata (lipid deposits in tendons, skin creases), grossly elevated total cholesterol (sometimes > 15 mmol/L)

***Treatment is not always needed and is indicated only if familial or other known risk factors are present*** [1]

<Callout title="Don't Panic About the Cholesterol!">
Serum cholesterol in PBC can be spectacularly high — sometimes 15–20 mmol/L. Junior doctors often panic and start statins. But the lipid profile is NOT atherogenic — it's predominantly HDL and Lp-X. These patients do NOT have increased cardiovascular mortality. Only treat hyperlipidaemia if there are **independent cardiovascular risk factors** (family history, diabetes, smoking, hypertension) on top of PBC.
</Callout>

#### 5. Biliary Strictures

***Biliary strictures — up to 60% of patients may develop a dominant stricture in intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary tree*** [9]

- **Pathophysiology**: Chronic periductal inflammation and fibrosis → narrowing of bile ducts → stricture formation. Although PBC primarily affects small ducts, progressive disease can lead to fibrotic changes affecting larger ducts as well.
- **Clinical significance**: Strictures worsen cholestasis, predispose to stone formation and cholangitis, and can mimic malignant obstruction
- **Management**: MRCP to delineate anatomy; endoscopic dilatation/stenting if symptomatic; always exclude cholangiocarcinoma as the cause of a new dominant stricture

#### 6. Choledocholithiasis and Cholelithiasis

***Choledocholithiasis and cholelithiasis — due to cholesterol or pigment stones*** [9]

- **Pathophysiology**:
  - **Cholesterol stones**: Cholestasis alters bile composition → supersaturation of bile with cholesterol (reduced bile acid secretion tips the cholesterol saturation index)
  - **Pigment stones**: Altered bilirubin metabolism in chronic liver disease → increased unconjugated bilirubin in bile → calcium bilirubinate precipitation
- Gallstones occur in ~30–40% of PBC patients (higher than general population)
- Can cause biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, or choledocholithiasis → obstructive jaundice (confusing the picture with worsening PBC cholestasis)

#### 7. Cholangitis

***Cholangitis — develops spontaneously in patients with bile duct stones or obstructing strictures or in patients after undergoing endoscopic or surgical manipulation*** [9]

- **Pathophysiology**: Bile duct obstruction (from stones or strictures) → bile stasis → bacterial colonisation (ascending infection from duodenum) → acute cholangitis
- **Clinical features**: Charcot's triad (fever, RUQ pain, jaundice) or Reynolds' pentad (+ shock + confusion in suppurative cholangitis)
- **Organisms**: E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterococcus
- **Management**: IV antibiotics, biliary drainage (ERCP ± sphincterotomy for stone removal)

#### 8. Cholangiocarcinoma and Gallbladder Cancer

***Cholangiocarcinoma — high incidence necessitates screening including USG or MRCP with a measurement of serum CA19-9*** [9]

***Gallbladder cancer*** [9]

- **Pathophysiology**: Chronic biliary inflammation → epithelial metaplasia → dysplasia → carcinoma. The same chronic inflammatory milieu that drives duct destruction in PBC also creates a pro-carcinogenic environment in the biliary epithelium.
- **Risk**: Lower than in PSC (where cholangiocarcinoma risk is 10–15% lifetime), but still elevated compared to general population
- **Screening**: Regular USS or MRCP + serum CA 19-9 (though CA 19-9 is non-specific and can be elevated in any cholestatic state)
- **Suspect malignancy if**: Sudden clinical deterioration, rapidly rising bilirubin disproportionate to disease stage, new dominant stricture, rapid weight loss

<Callout title="Cholangiocarcinoma — PBC vs PSC Risk">
The risk of cholangiocarcinoma is much higher in **PSC** than PBC. However, PBC patients are NOT immune — screening is still recommended [9]. A sudden change in clinical trajectory in a stable PBC patient (especially worsening jaundice unresponsive to treatment, or a new stricture on imaging) should always prompt evaluation for cholangiocarcinoma.
</Callout>

### Part C: Complications Related to Associated Autoimmune Diseases

Because PBC clusters with other autoimmune diseases, complications of these associations should also be considered:

| Associated Disease | Prevalence | Potential Complications |
|---|---|---|
| **Sjögren's syndrome** | 40–65% [1] | Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (corneal damage from dryness), dental caries (reduced saliva), parotid gland enlargement, rarely lymphoma (MALT lymphoma) |
| **Hashimoto's thyroiditis** | 10–15% [1] | Hypothyroidism → fatigue (compounding PBC fatigue), weight gain, constipation, cognitive slowing |
| **Systemic sclerosis** | 5–10% [1] | Raynaud's phenomenon, oesophageal dysmotility (GERD, dysphagia — important because GERD + oesophageal varices = increased bleeding risk), pulmonary fibrosis, renal crisis |
| **Rheumatoid arthritis** | 5–10% [1] | Joint destruction, extra-articular manifestations |
| **Coeliac disease** | ~6% | Exacerbates malabsorption; gluten-free diet needed |
| **Renal tubular acidosis (Type 1)** | Rare | Non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis; nephrocalcinosis; worsens osteoporosis (chronic acidosis mobilises bone calcium) |

---

### Prognosis

***Factors associated with a poorer prognosis*** [1]:

| Prognostic Factor | Explanation |
|---|---|
| ***Unresponsive to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)*** [1] | UDCA responders have near-normal life expectancy; non-responders progress to cirrhosis and transplant need |
| ***Presence of symptoms at the time of diagnosis*** [1] | Symptomatic patients have more advanced disease at baseline and a shorter time to complications |
| ***Elevated ALP and bilirubin levels*** [1] | Reflect ongoing cholestatic injury; bilirubin is the single strongest prognostic marker — rising bilirubin = severe ductopenia |
| ***Advanced histological stage*** [1] | Stage 3–4 at diagnosis = already significant fibrosis/cirrhosis with limited time before decompensation |
| ***Presence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)*** [1] | ***Associated with more rapid progression*** [1]; anti-gp210 particularly associated with hepatic failure phenotype |

**Natural history without treatment**: Median survival from symptom onset to death or transplant was ~10–15 years before UDCA era. With UDCA, responders have survival comparable to general population. Non-responders still face progressive disease, but newer second-line agents (bezafibrate, elafibranor, seladelpar) are improving outcomes.
