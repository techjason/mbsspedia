## Diagnostic Criteria for Primary Biliary Cholangitis

### The Logic Before the Criteria

Before memorising criteria, understand the *reasoning* behind them. PBC is an autoimmune disease that destroys small intrahepatic bile ducts. You cannot see these ducts on imaging (they're microscopic, < 100 µm). So the diagnosis rests on three pillars:

1. **Biochemistry** — Is there evidence of cholestasis? (↑ ALP)
2. **Serology** — Is there the autoimmune signature? (AMA)
3. **Histology** — Can we see the duct destruction directly? (Liver biopsy)

And critically, you must first **exclude** anything else that could explain the cholestasis — especially extrahepatic biliary obstruction and other liver diseases.

---

### Formal Diagnostic Criteria (AASLD/EASL Guidelines)

***Diagnosis of PBC is established if there is no extrahepatic biliary obstruction, no comorbidity affecting the liver, and ≥ 2 of the following 3 criteria are present*** [1]:

| Criterion | Detail | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Cholestatic biochemistry** | ***ALP ≥ 1.5× upper limit of normal*** [1] | ALP ("alkaline phosphatase") is an enzyme concentrated on the canalicular membrane of bile duct epithelium. When bile ducts are damaged/obstructed, ALP is released into blood. A persistently elevated ALP of hepatic origin (confirmed by concurrent ↑GGT) is the biochemical hallmark of cholestasis. The 1.5× threshold distinguishes clinically significant cholestasis from non-specific mild elevations. |
| **2. Serology** | ***Presence of AMA at a titre of ≥ 1:40*** [1] | AMA targets PDC-E2 on the inner mitochondrial membrane. AMA is ~95% sensitive and ~98% specific for PBC. ***AMA M2 is particularly diagnostic*** [1] — the M2 subtype specifically recognises the lipoyl domain of PDC-E2. |
| **3. Histology** | ***Histological evidence of PBC: non-suppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts*** [1] | Direct visualisation of the hallmark "florid duct lesion" — lymphocytic and granulomatous inflammation centred on portal tract bile ducts, with epithelial damage and duct loss. "Non-suppurative" means there are NO neutrophils or pus (distinguishing it from ascending bacterial cholangitis). |

<Callout title="Practical Application of Diagnostic Criteria">
In practice, most PBC is diagnosed with just **criterion 1 + criterion 2** (raised ALP + positive AMA). ***Liver biopsy is often NOT required to establish the diagnosis*** [1] when these two are concordant. This is a key exam point — don't reflexively order a biopsy on every PBC patient.

The diagnosis requires meeting 2 out of 3 criteria, PLUS:
- **No extrahepatic biliary obstruction** (excluded by USS ± MRCP)
- **No other comorbidity affecting the liver** (excluded by history, viral serology, drug history, etc.)
</Callout>

### When Is Each Criterion Alone Insufficient?

| Scenario | Why It's Not Enough | What to Do |
|---|---|---|
| Raised ALP alone | Non-specific — could be bone disease, drug-induced, pregnancy, malignancy, extrahepatic obstruction | Confirm hepatic origin with GGT; check AMA; exclude obstruction with USS |
| AMA positive alone | ~0.5% of normal population are AMA+; AMA can be found in other autoimmune diseases | AMA alone without cholestatic biochemistry or histological evidence is insufficient — may represent "pre-clinical PBC" (these patients should be monitored as ~15–20% develop PBC within 5 years) |
| Biopsy showing duct destruction alone | Could be drug-induced ductopenia, sarcoidosis, graft-vs-host disease | Needs AMA or persistent ALP elevation to confirm PBC specifically |

---

### Special Diagnostic Scenarios

#### AMA-Negative PBC (~5% of cases)

About 5% of patients have classic PBC clinically and histologically but are ***AMA-negative***. In these patients:
- Check for ***PBC-specific ANA patterns*** [1]:
  - **Multiple nuclear dots** pattern (anti-sp100 antibodies)
  - **Rim-like / membranous** pattern (anti-gp210 antibodies)
- These ANA patterns have high specificity for PBC
- ***Liver biopsy becomes essential*** in AMA-negative suspected PBC to confirm histological features [1]
- The disease behaves identically to AMA-positive PBC

#### Suspected PBC-AIH Overlap

***Liver biopsy is indicated in patients if the diagnosis is in doubt, patient has evidence of autoimmune hepatitis, or if patient is not responding optimally with ursodeoxycholic acid*** [1].

Features suggesting overlap [1]:
- ALT > 5× ULN
- IgG > 2× ULN or positive anti-SMA
- Interface hepatitis on biopsy (moderate to severe)

The Paris criteria for PBC-AIH overlap require ≥ 2 of 3 PBC features AND ≥ 2 of 3 AIH features:

| PBC Features (need ≥ 2) | AIH Features (need ≥ 2) |
|---|---|
| ALP ≥ 2× ULN or GGT ≥ 5× ULN | ALT ≥ 5× ULN |
| AMA positive | IgG ≥ 2× ULN or anti-SMA positive |
| Florid duct lesion on biopsy | Moderate-to-severe interface hepatitis on biopsy |

<Callout title="ANA in PBC — A Prognostic, Not Just Diagnostic, Marker" type="error">
***Presence of ANA in PBC can cause confusion with autoimmune hepatitis or overlap syndrome*** [1]. But ANA positivity in PBC also carries prognostic significance: ***Presence of ANA is associated with more rapid progression of disease and a poorer prognosis*** [1]. So when you see ANA+ in a PBC patient, think:
1. Could this be overlap with AIH? → Check ALT, IgG, consider biopsy
2. This patient may have a worse prognosis regardless → Monitor more closely

<Callout title="The Three-Step Diagnostic Logic" type="idea">
Think of PBC diagnosis in three simple steps:
1. **Is it cholestasis?** → ↑ALP/GGT (yes) vs ↑ALT/AST predominantly (no — think hepatitic causes)
2. **Is it intrahepatic or extrahepatic?** → USS shows normal bile ducts (intrahepatic) vs dilated ducts (extrahepatic)
3. **Is it PBC specifically?** → AMA positive (yes, with high specificity) → diagnosis confirmed

***Diagnosis of PBC is suspected when LFT shows a cholestatic pattern (↑ ALP and GGT) and USG shows no evidence of biliary disease or a SOL*** [1].
</Callout>

## Investigation Modalities — Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Biochemical Tests

#### A. Liver Function Tests (LFT)

| Parameter | Expected Finding in PBC | Interpretation & Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***ALP*** | ***Almost always elevated, often to striking levels, and is of hepatic origin*** [1] | ALP sits on the canalicular membrane of cholangiocytes and hepatocytes. Cholestasis causes detergent action of retained bile acids on cell membranes → ALP released into serum. It is the **single most characteristic biochemical abnormality** in PBC. Confirm hepatic origin by concurrent GGT elevation (bone ALP rises without GGT). |
| ***GGT*** | ***Elevated*** [1] | GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) is found on biliary epithelium. Elevation parallels ALP in cholestatic disease. Also induced by alcohol and certain drugs (enzyme inducer). In PBC, ↑GGT confirms the ↑ALP is of hepatobiliary rather than bone origin. |
| ***AST and ALT*** | ***Normal or slightly elevated*** [1] | Aminotransferases reflect hepatocyte injury. In PBC, the primary target is bile ducts, NOT hepatocytes (at least early on). So ALT/AST are only mildly raised. If ALT > 5× ULN → think PBC-AIH overlap. ***Serum aminotransferases may be normal or slightly elevated*** [1]. |
| ***Bilirubin*** | ***Normal in the early course of disease but becomes elevated as the disease progresses*** [1] | Early PBC → enough remaining bile ducts to handle bilirubin excretion → normal bilirubin. As ductopenia progresses → bilirubin cannot be excreted → rises. ***Conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin are both increased*** [1]. ***Elevated serum bilirubin is a poor prognostic sign*** [1] — it reflects severe, late-stage ductopenia. |
| ***Albumin*** | ***Hypoalbuminaemia in patients who have developed liver cirrhosis*** [1] | Albumin is synthesised by hepatocytes. In early PBC, hepatocyte function is preserved → normal albumin. In cirrhosis → synthetic failure → ↓albumin. Albumin half-life is ~20 days, so it reflects chronic (not acute) synthetic function. |

<Callout title="The LFT Pattern Tells the Story" type="idea">
PBC gives a **cholestatic** LFT pattern: ALP and GGT are disproportionately elevated compared to transaminases. This immediately separates it from **hepatitic** causes (viral hepatitis, AIH, Wilson's) where ALT/AST dominate. Think of it this way:
- **Cholestatic pattern** (↑↑ALP/GGT, ↔/↑ALT) → duct disease → PBC, PSC, drug-induced cholestasis, obstruction
- **Hepatitic pattern** (↑↑ALT/AST, ↔/↑ALP) → hepatocyte disease → viral, AIH, drug-induced hepatitis, Wilson's
- In cirrhosis from PBC, ALP is typically elevated but < 2–3× ULN due to late-stage ductopenia (fewer ducts = less ALP to release) [8]
</Callout>

#### B. Complete Blood Count (CBC)

***CBC with differentials*** [1]:
- ***Pancytopenia*** [1] in advanced disease — reflects **hypersplenism** from portal hypertension
  - ***Patients with PBC may have iron deficiency anaemia due to GI blood loss related to portal hypertension*** [1] — oesophageal or rectal variceal bleeding
  - ***Patients with liver cirrhosis may develop leukopenia and thrombocytopenia*** [1] — sequestration in enlarged spleen + decreased thrombopoietin production by diseased liver

#### C. Lipid Profile

***Serum lipids may be strikingly elevated in PBC*** [1]:
- ***Patients with early PBC often have mild elevations in LDL and VLDL and striking elevations in HDL*** [1]
- Why? Bile is the major route for cholesterol excretion. Cholestasis → cholesterol retention. Additionally, lipoprotein-X (Lp-X) — an abnormal lipoprotein — accumulates in cholestasis and is measured as "LDL" by some assays, artefactually inflating it.
- ***Increase in HDL explains why patients with PBC despite with striking hypercholesterolaemia do not appear to be at increased risk of death from atherosclerosis*** [1]
- Clinical pearl: Don't reflexively start statins for high cholesterol in PBC — the lipid profile is not atherogenic.

#### D. Clotting Profile

- **PT / INR** may be prolonged in two settings:
  1. **Early** — Vitamin K malabsorption from cholestasis → reduced synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, X (correctable with parenteral vitamin K)
  2. **Late** — Hepatic synthetic failure in cirrhosis → reduced production of ALL clotting factors (NOT correctable with vitamin K alone)
- Differentiating these two: give 10 mg IV vitamin K. If PT corrects → malabsorption. If PT does NOT correct → synthetic failure.

#### E. Immunoglobulins

| Immunoglobulin | Finding | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **IgM** | ↑↑ (Polyclonal) | Characteristically elevated in PBC — possibly reflects chronic B-cell stimulation against mitochondrial antigens. This is fairly specific: ↑IgM + cholestasis strongly suggests PBC. |
| **IgG** | Normal to mild ↑ | If IgG is markedly elevated (> 2× ULN), consider AIH or PBC-AIH overlap |
| **IgG4** | Normal | If elevated, consider IgG4-associated cholangitis — important DDx |

---

### 2. Serological / Autoantibody Tests

#### A. Anti-Mitochondrial Antibody (AMA)

***Serological hallmark of PBC — 95% of patients are positive for AMA*** [1].

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Target antigen** | PDC-E2 (E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) on inner mitochondrial membrane |
| **Sensitivity** | ~95% (5% of PBC is AMA-negative) |
| **Specificity** | ~98% (very few false positives) |
| **Diagnostic subtype** | ***AMA M2 is particularly diagnostic*** [1] — targets the lipoyl domain of PDC-E2 specifically |
| **Other AMA subtypes** | M4 (sulfite oxidase), M8 (outer mitochondrial membrane), M9 (glycogen phosphorylase) — less commonly tested; their presence may indicate more aggressive disease |
| **Testing method** | Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on HEp-2 cells or rat kidney substrate; confirmed by ELISA for M2 |
| **False negatives** | ~5% of true PBC — these are "AMA-negative PBC" patients; check PBC-specific ANA |
| **AMA in non-PBC** | AMA can rarely be positive in autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver disease, or healthy individuals at low titre |

<Callout title="AMA — What 'M2' Actually Means">
The "M" in AMA stands for "mitochondrial," and the number refers to different mitochondrial antigen subtypes identified by immunofluorescence patterns. M2 is the most clinically relevant because it targets PDC-E2, the actual autoantigen in PBC. When an exam question says "AMA-M2 positive," this is essentially pathognomonic for PBC.
</Callout>

#### B. Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANA)

***Occurs in 70% of patients*** [1].

- ***Two immunofluorescence patterns are considered PBC-specific*** [1]:
  1. **Multiple nuclear dots pattern** — targeting anti-sp100 (a nuclear body protein)
  2. **Rim-like or membranous pattern** — targeting anti-gp210 (a nuclear pore glycoprotein)
- These patterns are distinct from the homogeneous or speckled ANA patterns seen in AIH or SLE
- ***Presence of ANA can cause confusion with autoimmune hepatitis or overlap syndrome*** [1]
- ***Presence of ANA is associated with more rapid progression of disease and a poorer prognosis*** [1]
- Anti-gp210 specifically is associated with hepatic failure phenotype (progressive jaundice)
- Anti-sp100 is more specific for PBC but has lower sensitivity

#### C. Other Autoantibodies to Check

| Antibody | Purpose | Expected in PBC |
|---|---|---|
| Anti-smooth muscle antibody (SMA) | Exclude AIH / overlap | Usually negative in PBC; positive suggests AIH component |
| Anti-LKM (liver-kidney microsomal) | Exclude AIH type 2 | Negative in PBC |
| pANCA | Exclude PSC | ***pANCA is typically negative in PBC; positive in PSC (30–80%)*** [3] |
| Serum IgG4 | Exclude IgG4-associated cholangitis | Normal in PBC; elevated in IgG4-SC |

---

### 3. Radiological Tests

#### A. Ultrasound (USS) Abdomen — FIRST-LINE Imaging

***USG abdomen — imaging to exclude extrahepatic biliary obstruction or space-occupying lesion in the liver*** [1].

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| **Normal bile ducts** (CBD < 6 mm, < 8 mm post-cholecystectomy) | Excludes extrahepatic obstruction → supports intrahepatic cholestasis (PBC, PSC, drugs) |
| **Dilated bile ducts** (CBD > 8 mm) | Suggests extrahepatic obstruction → NOT PBC → proceed to MRCP or ERCP to identify cause [5] |
| **No space-occupying lesion** | Excludes HCC or metastases as cause of deranged LFTs |
| **Hepatomegaly** | May be seen in PBC; non-specific |
| **Splenomegaly** | Suggests portal hypertension from advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis |
| **Ascites** | Decompensated cirrhosis |
| **Surface nodularity / coarse echotexture** | Suggests established cirrhosis [8] |

The maxim notes describe the jaundice investigation flowchart [5]: cholestatic pattern on LFTs → abdominal USS → if bile ducts normal → ***"Intrahepatic cholestasis — PBC/PSC, Drugs → AMA, P-ANCA, MRCP, Liver biopsy"*** [5]. If bile ducts dilated → ***"Extrahepatic cholestasis → Visualise bile duct"*** [5].

<Callout title="Why USS First?">
USS is non-invasive, cheap, widely available, and answers the single most important question: **Are the bile ducts dilated?** If yes → extrahepatic obstruction (stones, tumour, stricture). If no → intrahepatic cause. This one finding pivots your entire diagnostic pathway. In PBC, bile ducts are always **normal** on USS because the disease targets microscopic ducts invisible to ultrasound.
</Callout>

#### B. Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)

***MRCP — imaging to exclude extrahepatic biliary obstruction*** [1].

| Role | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Primary purpose in PBC workup** | Exclude extrahepatic causes when USS is equivocal, or to definitively rule out PSC |
| **Expected finding in PBC** | **Normal biliary tree** — because PBC affects small ducts (< 100 µm) that are below MRCP resolution |
| **Expected finding in PSC** | ***Characteristic multifocal strictures that alternate with dilatation of intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts resulting in "beaded" appearance*** [3] |
| **Advantages** | Non-invasive, no radiation, no contrast injection needed for biliary imaging, excellent at identifying duct anatomy |
| **When to order** | When USS cannot exclude obstruction; when PSC is in the differential; when AMA is negative and duct pathology must be excluded |

#### C. ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography)

- **NOT routinely indicated in PBC diagnosis** — PBC is a small-duct disease; ERCP visualises large ducts
- ***Indicated in patients who are unable to undergo MRCP*** (e.g., implanted metal devices) or ***in patients with early PSC changes that may be missed by MRCP*** [3]
- ERCP carries procedural risks (pancreatitis, perforation, cholangitis) and should only be performed when therapeutic intervention (stone removal, stent placement) is anticipated

#### D. Transient Elastography (FibroScan)

- **Non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis** — measures liver stiffness using ultrasound-based shear wave velocity [8]
- Increasingly used to **stage fibrosis** in PBC without biopsy
- Liver stiffness values:
  - < 7.1 kPa → minimal fibrosis (F0-F1)
  - 7.1–9.5 kPa → significant fibrosis (F2)
  - 9.5–12.5 kPa → advanced fibrosis (F3)
  - &gt; 12.5 kPa → cirrhosis (F4)
- Advantages: non-invasive, repeatable, good for monitoring progression
- Limitations: unreliable in obesity, ascites, acute hepatitis (inflammation falsely elevates stiffness)

---

### 4. Liver Biopsy

***Liver biopsy is often NOT required to establish the diagnosis of PBC but can provide useful information with regard to staging and prognosis*** [1].

#### Indications for Biopsy in PBC

***Indicated in patients if*** [1]:
1. ***The diagnosis is in doubt*** (e.g., AMA-negative, atypical features)
2. ***Patient has evidence of autoimmune hepatitis*** (elevated ALT/IgG → need to confirm/exclude overlap)
3. ***Patient is not responding optimally with ursodeoxycholic acid*** (to reassess staging and look for other pathology)
4. Need to assess fibrosis stage when non-invasive methods are inconclusive

#### Histological Findings and Staging

***Histological findings in PBC are staged on a scale of 0–4*** [1]:

| Stage | Name | Key Histological Features | Clinical Correlate |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Stage 0*** | ***Normal*** | Normal liver architecture | Pre-clinical PBC (AMA+ only) |
| ***Stage 1*** | ***Portal*** | ***Inflammation and/or abnormal connective tissue confined to portal areas*** [1]; **Florid duct lesion**: lymphocytic and epithelioid granulomatous inflammation centred on interlobular bile ducts; duct epithelial damage and focal duct destruction | Often asymptomatic; detected on screening LFTs |
| ***Stage 2*** | ***Periportal*** | ***Inflammation and/or fibrosis confined to portal and periportal areas*** [1]; Ductular proliferation (reactive ductules); periportal hepatitis (interface hepatitis) | May develop early symptoms (pruritus, fatigue) |
| ***Stage 3*** | ***Septal*** | ***Bridging fibrosis*** [1] — fibrous septa linking portal tracts to each other or to central veins; progressive ductopenia (loss of bile ducts in > 50% of portal tracts) | More symptomatic; early features of portal hypertension |
| ***Stage 4*** | ***Cirrhosis*** | ***Cirrhosis*** [1] — regenerative nodules, complete architectural distortion, severe ductopenia | Decompensated liver disease; jaundice, ascites, varices |

The hallmark lesion — the **"florid duct lesion"** — is pathognomonic:
- A medium-sized interlobular bile duct is surrounded by a dense lymphocytic infiltrate
- Epithelioid granulomata may be seen around the damaged duct
- The duct epithelium shows degenerative changes (vacuolation, nuclear irregularity, eosinophilic change)
- "Non-suppurative" = NO neutrophils (this is immune-mediated destruction, not infection)

<Callout title="The Florid Duct Lesion vs Onion-Skin Fibrosis" type="error">
Don't confuse the histology of PBC with PSC:
- **PBC**: Florid duct lesion — granulomatous inflammation destroying small interlobular ducts. "Non-suppurative destructive cholangitis."
- **PSC**: Onion-skin periductal fibrosis — concentric layers of fibrosis around medium/large bile ducts. Very different pattern.

Both cause ductopenia eventually, but the mechanism and morphology differ completely.
</Callout>

---

### 5. Additional Investigations for Screening and Staging

Once PBC is diagnosed, additional tests are needed to assess disease complications and associated conditions:

| Investigation | Purpose | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Thyroid function tests** | Screen for Hashimoto's thyroiditis | Associated in 10–15% [1]; check at diagnosis and periodically |
| **Schirmer's test / salivary flow** | Screen for Sjögren's syndrome | Associated in 40–65% [1]; ask about sicca symptoms |
| **DEXA scan** | Screen for osteoporosis | Hepatic osteodystrophy — retained toxins inhibit osteoblasts + vitamin D malabsorption [1] |
| **Serum vitamin A and calcidiol** | Screen for fat-soluble vitamin deficiency | ***Vitamin A and D deficiency are more common requiring supplementation; measurement of serum vitamin A and calcidiol is required*** [1] |
| **Serum vitamin K** (or PT/INR) | Screen for vitamin K deficiency | Coagulopathy from malabsorption |
| **Serum AFP + USS 6-monthly** | HCC surveillance (if cirrhotic) | ***Patients with PBC and cirrhosis are at increased risk of HCC*** [1] |
| **Upper GI endoscopy (OGD)** | Variceal screening (if cirrhotic) | Portal hypertension → oesophageal varices → risk of UGIB |
| **FibroScan or ELF score** | Non-invasive fibrosis staging | Monitor progression; assess need for transplant referral |

---

### 6. Prognostic Markers and Risk Stratification

***Factors associated with a poorer prognosis*** [1]:

| Factor | Explanation |
|---|---|
| ***Unresponsive to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)*** | UDCA responders have near-normal life expectancy; non-responders progress to cirrhosis. Assessed at 1 year using criteria (see below). |
| ***Presence of symptoms at the time of diagnosis*** | Symptomatic patients have more advanced disease at baseline |
| ***Elevated ALP and bilirubin levels*** | Reflect severe cholestasis and ductopenia; bilirubin is the single strongest prognostic marker |
| ***Advanced histological stage*** | Stage 3–4 at diagnosis = already significant fibrosis/cirrhosis |
| ***Presence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)*** | ***Associated with more rapid progression*** [1]; anti-gp210 particularly predicts hepatic failure |

#### Assessing UDCA Response (at 12 months)

Multiple criteria exist to define "UDCA response" — all assess whether the biochemistry has improved after 1 year of UDCA:

| Criteria | Definition of Response |
|---|---|
| **Barcelona criteria** | ALP decrease > 40% of baseline OR normalisation |
| **Paris-I criteria** | ALP < 3× ULN AND AST < 2× ULN AND bilirubin ≤ 1 mg/dL |
| **Paris-II criteria** (early disease) | ALP < 1.5× ULN AND AST < 1.5× ULN AND normal bilirubin |
| **Toronto criteria** | ALP < 1.67× ULN |
| **UK-PBC risk score** | Composite score using ALP, ALT/AST, bilirubin, albumin, platelet count at 12 months |
| **GLOBE score** | Uses age at diagnosis + bilirubin, ALP, albumin, platelet count after 1 year UDCA |

Non-responders require second-line therapy (obeticholic acid, bezafibrate) or transplant referral.

---

### Putting It All Together — Investigation Summary Table

| Investigation | Key Finding in PBC | When to Order |
|---|---|---|
| **LFT** | ↑↑ALP/GGT; ↔/↑ALT/AST; ↔/↑bilirubin (late) | Always — first-line |
| **AMA** | Positive ≥ 1:40 (95%); M2 subtype diagnostic | Always — diagnostic |
| **ANA** | Positive 70%; look for nuclear dots or rim pattern | Always — prognostic and for DDx of overlap |
| **Immunoglobulins** | ↑IgM; normal IgG (↑IgG → overlap) | Always |
| **USS abdomen** | Normal bile ducts; no SOL | Always — exclude extrahepatic obstruction |
| **MRCP** | Normal in PBC; beading in PSC | If USS equivocal or PSC suspected |
| **Liver biopsy** | Florid duct lesion; staging 0–4 | Only if diagnosis in doubt, AIH suspected, or suboptimal UDCA response |
| **FibroScan** | Liver stiffness correlates with fibrosis stage | Non-invasive staging and monitoring |
| **Lipid profile** | ↑↑Cholesterol (↑HDL, Lp-X) | Baseline; reassurance — NOT atherogenic |
| **CBC** | Pancytopenia in advanced disease | Baseline and monitoring |
| **TFTs** | Hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's) | Screen at diagnosis |
| **Vitamin A, 25-OH-D** | Deficiency from fat malabsorption | Screen at diagnosis |
| **DEXA** | Osteoporosis/osteopenia | Screen at diagnosis |
| **AFP + USS 6-monthly** | HCC surveillance | If cirrhosis established |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Diagnosis of PBC">

1. **Diagnostic criteria**: ≥ 2 of 3 — ***ALP ≥ 1.5× ULN***, ***AMA ≥ 1:40***, ***histological evidence*** — PLUS no extrahepatic obstruction [1]

2. **In practice**: Most diagnosed by **raised ALP + positive AMA** alone. ***Biopsy often NOT required*** [1].

3. **AMA-M2** is the serological hallmark (~95% sensitive, ~98% specific). In the 5% who are AMA-negative, look for **PBC-specific ANA** (anti-sp100, anti-gp210).

4. **USS is mandatory** to exclude extrahepatic obstruction. Normal ducts + ↑ALP + AMA+ = PBC.

5. **Biopsy indications**: diagnostic doubt, suspected AIH overlap, suboptimal UDCA response.

6. **Bilirubin is the strongest prognostic marker** — rising bilirubin = advanced ductopenia = poor prognosis.

7. **Always screen for**: thyroid disease, Sjögren's, osteoporosis, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, and HCC (if cirrhotic).

8. **UDCA response at 12 months** determines prognosis and need for second-line therapy.

      markscheme: "Despite strikingly elevated total cholesterol, PBC patients have predominantly elevated HDL and lipoprotein-X (Lp-X). HDL is anti-atherogenic. Lp-X is an abnormal lipoprotein that accumulates in cholestasis and is measured as LDL by some assays but is NOT atherogenic. The majority of cholesterol elevation is from these anti-atherogenic fractions, explaining the lack of increased cardiovascular risk."

      question: "After diagnosing PBC, list 5 screening investigations you would order and the condition each screens for.",
      markscheme: "(1) TFTs - Hashimoto's thyroiditis (10-15%). (2) Schirmer's test or sicca symptom assessment - Sjogren's syndrome (40-65%). (3) DEXA scan - osteoporosis from hepatic osteodystrophy. (4) Serum vitamin A and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D - fat-soluble vitamin deficiency from malabsorption. (5) AFP and USS 6-monthly - HCC surveillance if cirrhosis is established."
