# Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)

## Definition

Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) — formerly called **Primary Biliary Cirrhosis** (the name was changed in 2015 to reflect the fact that most patients are now diagnosed before cirrhosis develops) — is a chronic, progressive, autoimmune cholestatic liver disease characterised by a **T-lymphocyte–mediated attack on small intrahepatic (interlobular) bile ducts** [1][2].

Let's break down the name:
- **Primary** → the disease arises *de novo* from autoimmune mechanisms, not secondary to stones, strictures, or external compression.
- **Biliary** → targets the **bile ducts** (specifically the small/medium intrahepatic interlobular bile ducts, < 100 µm).
- **Cholangitis** → "chol-" = bile, "-ang-" = vessel/duct, "-itis" = inflammation. So: inflammation of the bile ducts.

The sustained, granulomatous destruction of these bile ductules leads to progressive **cholestasis** (impaired bile flow), then **biliary fibrosis**, and ultimately **liver cirrhosis** and **liver failure** if untreated [1].

<Callout title="Key Concept">
PBC is an autoimmune destruction of *small* intrahepatic bile ducts (interlobular ducts). This is fundamentally different from Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), which targets *large* intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts with fibrotic stricturing. The distinction matters for diagnosis, associations, and management.

## Epidemiology

### Incidence and Prevalence
- **Global prevalence**: approximately 1.9–40.2 per 100,000 population (varies by region; highest in Northern Europe and North America) [3].
- Incidence appears to be increasing, partly due to earlier diagnosis from routine liver function testing.
- In Hong Kong and Asia, PBC is less common than in Western populations but is increasingly recognised. In HK, chronic Hepatitis B remains the dominant cause of liver cirrhosis (~90%), with PBC representing a small but important subset of biliary causes of cirrhosis [2][4].

### Age and Sex
- ***Extreme female predominance (90–95% female)*** [1][2].
  - Why? The precise reason is unclear, but leading hypotheses include:
    - **X-chromosome monosomy**: Enhanced X chromosome loss in lymphocytes of PBC patients → disinhibition of X-linked immune regulatory genes.
    - **Oestrogen effects on immune regulation**: Oestrogen modulates T-cell and B-cell function, potentially promoting loss of tolerance to mitochondrial antigens.
    - **Microchimerism**: Fetal cells persisting in maternal circulation post-pregnancy may trigger graft-vs-host–like immune reactions against biliary epithelium.
- ***Age of diagnosis: typically 30–65 years (middle-aged women)*** [1].
- Rarely diagnosed before 25 or after 70.

### Geographic Variation
- Highest prevalence in **Northern Europe** (UK, Scandinavia) and **North America**.
- Lower prevalence in Asia and Africa, though increasingly diagnosed.
- Clustering in families: first-degree relatives of PBC patients have a ~100-fold increased risk.

## Risk Factors

| Risk Factor | Mechanism / Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Female sex** | ~9:1 female-to-male ratio; X-chromosome and hormonal mechanisms |
| **Family history of PBC** | Concordance rate ~63% in monozygotic twins; strong genetic component |
| **HLA associations** | HLA-DRB1*08 (risk), HLA-DRB1*11 (protective) |
| **Other autoimmune diseases** | PBC clusters with other autoimmune conditions (see below) |
| **Recurrent urinary tract infections** | Molecular mimicry: *E. coli* pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2) shares epitopes with human mitochondrial PDC-E2, triggering cross-reactive autoimmunity |
| **Smoking** | Dose-dependent increased risk; mechanism may involve oxidative modification of mitochondrial antigens |
| **Environmental chemicals** | Xenobiotics (e.g., halogenated hydrocarbons, nail polish chemicals like 2-octynoic acid) can modify PDC-E2 → neoantigen formation → immune attack |
| **Prior pregnancies** | Related to microchimerism hypothesis |

<Callout title="Molecular Mimicry — The Key Pathogenetic Concept" type="idea">
The E2 subunit of the **pyruvate dehydrogenase complex** (PDC-E2), located on the inner mitochondrial membrane, is the primary autoantigen in PBC. Certain bacteria (especially *E. coli*) have PDC-E2 homologues. Repeated UTIs may trigger cross-reactive immune responses in genetically susceptible individuals → loss of tolerance → autoimmune destruction of biliary epithelial cells (which uniquely express PDC-E2 on their apical surface after apoptosis, unlike most other cell types where PDC-E2 is cleaved during apoptosis).
</Callout>

## Associated Medical Conditions

PBC is strongly associated with other autoimmune diseases. Think of PBC as part of an "autoimmune constellation" [1]:

| Associated Condition | Prevalence in PBC | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ***Sjögren's syndrome*** | ***40–65%*** | Sicca symptoms (dry eyes, dry mouth); most common association |
| ***Hashimoto's thyroiditis*** | ***10–15%*** | Screen with TFT at diagnosis |
| **Systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma)** | ***5–10%*** | Especially CREST variant |
| **Rheumatoid arthritis** | ***5–10%*** | |
| **Coeliac disease** | ~6% | Screen if diarrhoea or malabsorption disproportionate to cholestasis |
| **Raynaud's phenomenon** | Common | Due to overlap with systemic sclerosis |
| **Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)** | Overlap syndrome in ~10% | "PBC-AIH overlap" — important diagnostic consideration |
| **Renal tubular acidosis (Type 1)** | Rare | Autoimmune tubular damage |

<Callout title="High Yield — Autoimmune Associations" type="error">
A common exam pitfall: Students forget to screen for **thyroid disease** and **Sjögren's syndrome** in PBC. Always check TFT and ask about sicca symptoms. Sjögren's is the *most common* autoimmune association (up to 65%).
</Callout>

## Anatomy and Function — The Biliary System

To understand PBC, you must understand **which bile ducts are targeted** and why their destruction matters.

### Normal Bile Duct Anatomy

```
Hepatocytes → Bile canaliculi → Canals of Hering → Cholangioles → 
Interlobular bile ducts (< 100 µm) → Septal bile ducts → 
Intrahepatic bile ducts → Right and Left hepatic ducts → 
Common hepatic duct → (+ cystic duct) → Common bile duct → Ampulla of Vater
```

**PBC targets the small interlobular bile ducts** (those within the portal triads, < 100 µm diameter). These are lined by **biliary epithelial cells (BECs / cholangiocytes)**.

### Why Does Destroying Small Bile Ducts Cause Disease?

1. **Bile formation**: Hepatocytes produce bile and secrete it into canaliculi. Bile flows through the duct system to the intestine.
2. **Bile duct destruction** → bile cannot flow out of the liver → **cholestasis** (bile stasis within the liver).
3. **Retained bile acids** are toxic to hepatocytes → ongoing hepatocyte injury → inflammation → fibrosis → cirrhosis.
4. **Lack of bile in the intestine** → impaired fat emulsification → **steatorrhoea** → malabsorption of **fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)**.

### The Portal Triad

Each portal triad contains:
- Hepatic artery branch
- Portal vein branch
- **Bile duct** (interlobular) ← THIS is the target in PBC

The classic histological lesion of PBC — the **"florid duct lesion"** — shows lymphocytic infiltration and granulomatous destruction centred on these portal triad bile ducts.

## Etiology and Pathophysiology

### Etiology

PBC is an **autoimmune disease** of unknown precise aetiology, arising from a combination of:

1. **Genetic susceptibility**
   - HLA associations: HLA-DRB1*08 (susceptibility), HLA-DRB1*11, HLA-DRB1*13 (protective)
   - Non-HLA genes: IL-12A, IL-12RB2, STAT4, IRF5, CTLA-4, TNFSF15
   - Strong familial clustering; ~63% concordance in monozygotic twins

2. **Environmental triggers**
   - Molecular mimicry (bacterial PDC-E2, especially from *E. coli*)
   - Xenobiotics (halogenated compounds that modify PDC-E2 → neoantigen)
   - Smoking
   - Possibly hormonal factors (explaining female predominance)

3. **Loss of immune tolerance**
   - The central autoantigen is **PDC-E2** (E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex), located on the inner mitochondrial membrane
   - In PBC, biliary epithelial cells (BECs) are unique: when BECs undergo apoptosis, **PDC-E2 remains immunologically intact on apoptotic blebs** (it is not glutathionylated/cleaved as in other cell types)
   - This intact PDC-E2 is presented to the immune system → T-cell and B-cell activation → autoimmune attack specifically on BECs

```

### Immunopathology in Detail

1. **Humoral immunity**: 
   - **Anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA)** — specifically AMA-M2 targeting PDC-E2 — are the serological hallmark (present in ~95% of PBC patients) [1]
   - AMA are highly specific (~98%) but are NOT directly pathogenic; they are a marker of the underlying autoimmune process
   - Other AMA subtypes (M4, M8, M9) are less commonly tested

2. **Cellular immunity** (the actual effector mechanism):
   - **CD4+ T-helper cells** and **CD8+ cytotoxic T cells** infiltrate the portal tracts and directly attack BECs
   - The granulomatous inflammation around damaged ducts is the hallmark histological feature
   - **CD8+ T cells** are the primary effectors of BEC destruction

3. **Biliary epithelial cell (BEC) biology**:
   - BECs in PBC show increased apoptosis
   - Unique failure to cleave PDC-E2 during apoptosis → persistent antigen exposure
   - BECs also express MHC class II molecules and can act as antigen-presenting cells, amplifying the immune response
   - Progressive BEC loss → **ductopenia** (vanishing bile duct syndrome) → cholestasis

### The Cholestatic Cascade

Once bile ducts are destroyed and cholestasis develops:

| Consequence | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Pruritus** | Retained bile acids (and possibly lysophosphatidic acid via autotaxin) stimulate itch receptors in skin; pruritogens accumulate due to impaired biliary excretion |
| **Jaundice** | Both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin accumulate; conjugated bilirubin regurgitates into blood from damaged bile ducts |
| **Steatorrhoea** | Reduced bile acid delivery to intestine → impaired micelle formation → fat malabsorption |
| **Vitamin A deficiency** | Fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption → night blindness, xerophthalmia |
| **Vitamin D deficiency** | Fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption → osteomalacia, contributes to osteoporosis |
| **Vitamin E deficiency** | Fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption → neurological dysfunction (rare) |
| **Vitamin K deficiency** | Fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption → coagulopathy (prolonged PT/INR) |
| **Hyperlipidaemia** | Cholesterol is normally excreted in bile; cholestasis → retained cholesterol; also ↑HDL and lipoprotein-X |
| **Xanthomata/Xanthelasma** | Deposition of lipid-laden macrophages in skin/tendons due to hyperlipidaemia |
| **Hyperpigmentation** | Melanin deposition (NOT bilirubin) — mechanism unclear but may relate to MSH-like peptides or bile acid–stimulated melanogenesis |
| **Hepatic osteodystrophy** | Retained toxins inhibit osteoblast function → osteoporosis; vitamin D malabsorption → osteomalacia |

<Callout title="Why Hyperpigmentation in PBC?" type="idea">
A common misconception: the skin darkening in PBC is NOT from jaundice/bilirubin. ***It is from melanin deposition*** [1]. The exact mechanism is debated, but it may involve bile acid–mediated stimulation of melanocyte activity or MSH-like peptide release. The pigmentation can be generalised but is often most prominent on sun-exposed areas.
</Callout>

## Classification

### Histological Staging (Ludwig / Scheuer Classification)

PBC is classically staged 0–4 based on liver biopsy [1][2]:

| Stage | Name | Histological Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Stage 0** | Normal | Normal liver histology |
| **Stage 1** | ***Portal stage*** | ***Inflammation and/or abnormal connective tissue confined to portal areas***; "florid duct lesion" — granulomatous destruction of interlobular bile ducts; lymphocytic infiltrate around damaged ducts |
| **Stage 2** | ***Periportal stage*** | ***Inflammation and/or fibrosis confined to portal and periportal areas***; proliferation of small bile ductules (ductular reaction); interface hepatitis may be seen |
| **Stage 3** | ***Septal stage*** | ***Bridging fibrosis*** — fibrous septa linking portal tracts; progressive ductopenia |
| **Stage 4** | ***Cirrhosis*** | ***Cirrhosis*** — regenerative nodules, complete architectural distortion |

<Callout title="Liver Biopsy in PBC" type="idea">
***Liver biopsy is often NOT required to establish the diagnosis of PBC*** [1] when ALP is elevated and AMA is positive. However, it ***is indicated if: the diagnosis is in doubt, there is evidence of autoimmune hepatitis overlap, or the patient is not responding optimally to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)*** [1]. Biopsy also provides useful prognostic information through staging.
</Callout>

### Clinical Classification

Some clinicians also classify PBC by clinical stage:

1. **Pre-clinical** — AMA positive, normal LFTs, asymptomatic
2. **Asymptomatic** — AMA positive, abnormal LFTs (↑ALP), no symptoms
3. **Symptomatic** — pruritus, fatigue, jaundice
4. **Decompensated** — cirrhosis with portal hypertension, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy

### AMA-Negative PBC (~5%)

About 5% of patients have typical clinical, biochemical, and histological features of PBC but are **AMA-negative**. In these patients:
- PBC-specific **ANA** patterns (multiple nuclear dots [anti-sp100] or rim-like/membranous [anti-gp210]) are often present
- The disease behaves identically to AMA-positive PBC
- Previously termed "autoimmune cholangitis"

### PBC-AIH Overlap Syndrome

~10% of PBC patients have features of both PBC and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH):
- Elevated transaminases (ALT > 5× ULN) in addition to cholestatic pattern
- Interface hepatitis on biopsy
- May be ANA-positive
- Requires combined treatment (UDCA + immunosuppression)

---

## Clinical Features

***Asymptomatic at diagnosis in 50–60% of cases*** [1] — often detected incidentally through raised ALP on routine blood tests.

### Symptoms

| Symptom | Frequency | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| ***Pruritus*** | Most common symptom (~70% of symptomatic patients) | Cholestasis → accumulation of pruritogens (bile acids, lysophosphatidic acid via autotaxin enzyme) → activation of itch receptors (TGR5, MRGPRX4) in skin nerve fibres. ***Worse at night*** [1]. Often ***precedes the development of jaundice*** [1]. Can be severely debilitating. |
| ***Fatigue*** | Very common (~80%) | Poorly understood; may involve central mechanisms (altered neurotransmission — serotonergic and corticotropin pathways), autonomic dysfunction, sleep disturbance from pruritus, and cytokine-mediated effects. Does NOT correlate with disease severity. Does NOT improve with liver transplantation in many cases. |
| ***Steatorrhoea*** | Variable | ***↓ Bile acid secretion into intestine*** [1] → impaired micelle formation → fat malabsorption → pale, bulky, foul-smelling, floating stools |
| **RUQ discomfort** | Common | Hepatomegaly → distension of Glisson's capsule (the liver itself has no pain fibres; pain comes from capsular stretch) |
| **Dry eyes and dry mouth (sicca symptoms)** | 40–65% | Associated Sjögren's syndrome → autoimmune destruction of lacrimal and salivary glands |
| **Arthralgia** | Variable | Associated autoimmune conditions (RA, Sjögren's) |
| **Weight loss** | Late feature | Fat malabsorption, anorexia from advanced liver disease |
| **Bone pain / fractures** | Late | Hepatic osteodystrophy (osteoporosis/osteomalacia from vitamin D deficiency and direct osteoblast inhibition) |
| **Night blindness** | Late | Vitamin A deficiency from fat malabsorption |
| **Easy bruising / bleeding** | Late | Vitamin K deficiency → impaired synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, X |

<Callout title="Pruritus in PBC — More Than Just Bile Acids">
The mechanism of pruritus in cholestasis has evolved. While bile acids were the traditional explanation, current evidence implicates **autotaxin** (an enzyme that produces lysophosphatidic acid, LPA) as a key mediator. Serum autotaxin levels correlate with itch severity. This is why cholestyramine (a bile acid sequestrant) helps but doesn't fully relieve itch in all patients, and why **IBAT inhibitors** (ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors, e.g., linerixibat) and **opioid antagonists** (naltrexone) may also be effective.
</Callout>

### Signs

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| ***Jaundice*** | ***Typically a late manifestation*** [1]; reflects severe ductopenia and cholestasis → bilirubin accumulation. Both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin elevated. ***Elevated serum bilirubin is a poor prognostic sign*** [1]. |
| ***Hyperpigmentation*** | ***Melanin deposition*** (NOT bilirubin) [1]. Diffuse, often more prominent in sun-exposed areas. Mechanism debated but may involve bile acid–stimulated melanogenesis. |
| ***Xanthomata and xanthelasma*** | ***Hyperlipidaemia*** [1] → lipid deposition. Xanthelasma = yellowish plaques around eyelids. Xanthomata = lipid deposits in tendons, skin creases. |
| ***Hepatomegaly*** | ***Becomes more common as PBC progresses*** [1]; initially due to cholestatic swelling, later due to fibrosis/cirrhosis with regenerative nodules |
| ***Splenomegaly*** | ***Becomes more common as PBC progresses*** [1]; reflects portal hypertension from progressive fibrosis/cirrhosis. ***Incidence appears to be decreasing probably because PBC is diagnosed in earlier stages than in the past*** [1]. |
| **Excoriations** | Secondary to scratching from severe pruritus |
| **Kayser-Fleischer–like rings** | Rare; copper deposition in Descemet's membrane (copper is normally excreted in bile; cholestasis → copper retention — but this does NOT indicate Wilson's disease) |
| **Spider angiomata** | Late; reflect hyperestrogenism from impaired hepatic oestrogen metabolism in cirrhosis |
| **Palmar erythema (liver palms)** | Late; hyperestrogenism in cirrhosis |
| **Ascites** | Late (decompensated cirrhosis); portal hypertension → increased hydrostatic pressure in splanchnic capillaries + hypoalbuminaemia → transudative fluid accumulation |
| **Peripheral oedema** | Late; hypoalbuminaemia + portal hypertension |

<Callout title="Physical Signs — Early vs Late" type="error">
A common exam mistake: listing jaundice and ascites as early features of PBC. In reality, ***jaundice is typically a late manifestation*** [1] and ascites only occurs with decompensated cirrhosis. The early signs are **excoriations** (from pruritus), **hyperpigmentation**, and possibly **xanthelasma**. If a patient has jaundice at presentation, the disease is already advanced and carries a worse prognosis.
</Callout>

### Signs in Decompensated PBC (Late Disease / Cirrhosis)

When PBC progresses to cirrhosis, all the general signs of chronic liver disease and portal hypertension may be seen [1][2]:

- **Ascites** — portal hypertension + hypoalbuminaemia
- **Variceal bleeding** — porto-systemic collaterals (oesophageal varices, rectal varices, caput medusae)
- **Hepatic encephalopathy** — failure of hepatic ammonia clearance + portosystemic shunting → ammonia and other neurotoxins reach the brain
- **Coagulopathy** — impaired synthesis of clotting factors + vitamin K malabsorption
- **Hepatorenal syndrome** — splanchnic vasodilation in cirrhosis → renal hypoperfusion → functional renal failure

<Callout title="Case Illustration — From the Felix Notes" type="idea">
The case in the senior notes [1] beautifully illustrates PBC progression: a 50-year-old woman with abnormal LFTs → pruritus → liver biopsy showing bile duct destruction → UDCA treatment → progressive ascites requiring paracentesis → hepatic encephalopathy after protein load → referral for liver transplantation. This represents the full natural history from diagnosis to decompensation.

## Key Differences: PBC vs PSC (High Yield Comparison)

Since PBC and PSC are the two major autoimmune biliary diseases, exam questions frequently test their differentiation:

| Feature | **PBC** | **PSC** |
|---|---|---|
| **Sex** | 90–95% Female | 70% Male |
| **Age** | 30–65 | 30–40 |
| **Target ducts** | Small intrahepatic interlobular ducts | Large intra- and extrahepatic ducts |
| **Associated disease** | Sjögren's, thyroid disease, scleroderma | ***Ulcerative colitis*** (70–80%) [3] |
| **Serological marker** | ***AMA*** (95% positive) | ***pANCA*** (80% positive); AMA negative |
| **Cholangiography** | Normal (small ducts not visible) | "Beading" — multifocal strictures and dilatations |
| **Histology** | Granulomatous duct destruction (florid duct lesion) | "Onion-skin" periductal fibrosis |
| **Cancer risk** | HCC (if cirrhosis) | ***Cholangiocarcinoma*** (10–15% lifetime risk) |
| **Treatment** | ***UDCA*** (proven benefit) | UDCA (less proven benefit); liver transplant |
| **Prognosis** | Better with UDCA; transplant if needed | Worse; high cholangioCA risk |
