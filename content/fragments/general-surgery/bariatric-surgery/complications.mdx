## Complications of Bariatric Surgery

Complications of bariatric surgery are best understood by organising them along **two axes**: (1) **timing** — early vs late, and (2) **procedure-specific** vs **general**. Every complication has a mechanistic explanation rooted in what the surgery actually does to the anatomy and physiology. If you understand the anatomy of each procedure, you can predict its complications from first principles.

---

## 1. Framework: Timing-Based Classification

| Timing | Definition | Key Complications |
|---|---|---|
| ***Immediate*** ( < 24 hours) | Related to the operative insult itself | ***Intra-abdominal bleeding*** (staple line / mesenteric vessels), anaesthetic complications, rhabdomyolysis |
| ***Early*** (24 hours – 30 days) | Related to healing and the acute postoperative state | ***Anastomotic / staple line leak***, PE/DVT, wound infection, acute kidney injury, respiratory failure |
| ***Late*** ( > 30 days) | Related to altered anatomy, chronic nutritional changes, and long-term sequelae | ***Internal hernia***, ***marginal ulcer***, ***nutritional deficiencies*** (Fe, B12, Ca, VitD), ***dumping syndrome***, gallstones, GORD, stomal stenosis, weight regain, psychological complications |

## 2. Early Complications (Perioperative)

### 2.1 Anastomotic Leak / Staple Line Leak

This is the ***most feared early complication*** of bariatric surgery [2][6].

**Incidence**: 1–5% overall. Highest for SG at the **angle of His** (the most proximal point of the staple line — where blood supply is most tenuous and intraluminal pressure is highest). For RYGB, leak most commonly occurs at the ***gastrojejunal anastomosis*** [2].

**Why does it happen?**
- **Technical factors**: Stapler misfires, tissue ischaemia at staple line, excessive tension on anastomosis
- **Patient factors**: Chronic tissue hypoxia (diabetes, smoking, obesity), chronic steroid use (impaired healing), malnutrition
- ***At the angle of His (SG)***: This is where the oesophagogastric junction meets the staple line. The blood supply here relies on small branches from the left gastric and left inferior phrenic arteries — a relative watershed zone. The intraluminal pressure is highest at this point (narrow lumen, angle). Hence, ***leaks at the angle of His are notoriously slow to heal*** [2]

**Clinical features**:
- ***Tachycardia > 120 bpm*** — often the ***earliest and most reliable sign***, appearing even before fever, pain, or peritonism [2][6]
- Fever, rising WCC/CRP, tachypnoea
- Peritonism (diffuse if free leak; localised if contained)
- Drain output: turbid, bilious, or resembling oral intake
- If missed → intra-abdominal abscess → sepsis → multi-organ failure

**Investigation**: ***CT abdomen with oral water-soluble contrast*** — gold standard. Look for contrast extravasation, extraluminal air, free fluid, abscess [1]

**Management** (depends on clinical stability and containment) [3][6]:
- *Stable, contained*: NPO + IV antibiotics + ***percutaneous drainage*** (interventional radiology) ± endoscopic stenting over the defect. ***Nutritional support: TPN or enteral feeding via jejunostomy distal to the leak*** [3]
- *Unstable, free peritonitis*: ***Emergency return to theatre*** — washout, attempt repair or drainage, +/- feeding jejunostomy. Wide drainage.
- ***Leaks at the angle of His (SG) take a long time to heal*** — may require weeks of NPO with nutritional support, endoscopic interventions (stents, endoscopic vacuum therapy/EndoSponge), and patience [2]

<Callout title="The Golden Rule" type="error">
***Tachycardia after bariatric surgery = leak until proven otherwise.*** Do not be reassured by the absence of fever or peritonism in the first 24–48 hours — these are late signs. In an obese patient, peritonism can be masked by the thick abdominal wall, and fever may be delayed by the immunosuppressive effect of obesity. The heart rate does not lie.
</Callout>

### 2.2 Intra-abdominal Bleeding (Staple Line Haemorrhage)

**Incidence**: 1–4%. Usually within first 24–48 hours.

**Sources** [2][6]:
- ***Staple line bleeding*** — the long staple line in SG (from antrum to angle of His) has many small vessels. Even with staple line reinforcement (oversewing/buttress), oozing can occur
- Mesenteric vessel injury during dissection
- ***Reactionary haemorrhage*** — bleeding that occurs as the stress-response vasoconstriction wears off (within 24 hours), unmasking a bleeding vessel [6]
- Splenic injury (rare, during mobilisation of the greater curvature near splenic hilum)

**Clinical features**: Tachycardia, hypotension, dropping Hb, blood in drain, melaena (intraluminal bleed) or abdominal distension (extraluminal haemoperitoneum)

**Management**:
- *Mild, self-limiting*: Monitor, transfuse if needed, correct coagulopathy
- *Significant / haemodynamically unstable*: Return to theatre → laparoscopic exploration → oversew bleeding point, washout. If intraluminal (blood per rectum), OGD may localise and treat the source

### 2.3 Venous Thromboembolism (DVT / PE)

**Why bariatric patients are at extremely high risk**:
- **Virchow's triad** is perfectly fulfilled:
  1. ***Stasis***: Obesity → venous compression → immobility → perioperative bed rest
  2. ***Hypercoagulability***: Obesity is a chronic inflammatory state → elevated fibrinogen, PAI-1, factor VIII; also pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopy reduces venous return
  3. ***Endothelial injury***: Surgical trauma, patient positioning (pressure points)

**Incidence**: Clinically significant PE: 0.3–2%. VTE is a **leading cause of death** after bariatric surgery.

**Prevention** [6]:
- ***LMWH*** (enoxaparin 40 mg BD or weight-adjusted dosing — standard 40 mg OD is often subtherapeutic in morbidly obese patients)
- ***Pneumatic compression devices*** — applied before induction, continued until fully mobile
- ***Early mobilisation*** — same day as surgery (ERAS principle)
- Some centres extend chemoprophylaxis for 2–4 weeks post-discharge (especially if BMI > 50 or prior VTE history)

**Presentation**: Sudden dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, hypoxia, haemoptysis (PE); calf pain and swelling (DVT). In an obese patient, distinguish from expected post-op breathlessness by: sudden onset, unilateral leg swelling, pleuritic quality of pain.

**Investigation**: CTPA (PE), lower limb Doppler USS (DVT)

### 2.4 Respiratory Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Prevention/Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Atelectasis*** | Reduced FRC in obesity (abdominal fat → ↓ diaphragmatic excursion); general anaesthesia → surfactant dysfunction; hypoventilation from pain | ***Incentive spirometry, chest physiotherapy, early mobilisation, semi-upright positioning*** [6] |
| **Pneumonia** | Atelectasis → mucus plugging → infection; aspiration risk (GORD, post-extubation) | As above + prophylactic antibiotics if high risk |
| ***Respiratory failure / Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome*** | OSA patients on opioids → central and obstructive apnoeas → hypoxia, hypercapnia | ***CPAP post-operatively for all OSA patients. Opioid-sparing analgesia*** (ERAS). Avoid benzodiazepines |

### 2.5 Rhabdomyolysis

A uniquely bariatric complication that is often overlooked:

**Mechanism**: Prolonged operative time (2–4+ hours) + morbid obesity → extreme pressure on muscles (especially gluteal and posterior thigh from positioning on the operating table) → ***crush injury to muscle tissue*** → myoglobin release → myoglobinaemia → ***renal tubular obstruction*** → **acute kidney injury**

**Risk factors**: BMI > 55, operative time > 3 hours, male sex, peripheral vascular disease

**Clinical features**: Muscle pain (especially buttocks/thighs — out of proportion to the surgical site), dark "cola-coloured" urine, rising CK (often > 5,000 U/L), rising creatinine, hyperkalaemia

**Investigation**: Serum CK (markedly elevated), urine myoglobin, renal function

**Management**: Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation (target UO > 200 mL/hr initially), alkalinise urine (IV sodium bicarbonate — keeps myoglobin soluble and prevents tubular precipitation), monitor and treat hyperkalaemia. Avoid nephrotoxins. Rarely requires haemodialysis.

**Prevention**: Adequate padding during positioning, minimise operative time, use intermittent position changes during long cases

### 2.6 Wound Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ***Surgical site infection (SSI)*** | Obesity → ↓ tissue oxygenation (poor microvascular perfusion through fat), hyperglycaemia (impaired neutrophil function), large wound surface area if open | ***Laparoscopic approach*** dramatically reduces SSI risk (small port sites vs large laparotomy). Weight-adjusted antibiotic prophylaxis essential (cefazolin 2–3 g, not standard 1 g) [6] |
| **Port-site hernia** | Fascial defect at trocar insertion sites ( > 10 mm) | Close all fascial defects > 10 mm. More common in obesity due to raised intra-abdominal pressure |
| ***Access port infection*** (gastric banding specific) | Subcutaneous port acts as foreign body → biofilm formation | One of the reasons gastric banding has been largely abandoned [2] |

---

## 3. Late Complications

### 3.1 Internal Hernia (RYGB-Specific)

***Internal hernia*** is the most important late surgical emergency specific to RYGB [2][6].

**Mechanism**: During RYGB construction, the Roux limb is passed through or alongside the transverse mesocolon, creating **mesenteric defects** — potential spaces through which bowel loops can herniate:
1. ***Petersen's space*** — between the Roux limb mesentery and the transverse mesocolon (most common)
2. ***Jejunojejunostomy mesenteric defect*** — at the site where the two limbs of jejunum are joined
3. ***Transverse mesocolon defect*** — if retrocolic Roux limb route used

**Why does it present late?** As patients lose significant weight (months to years post-surgery), the ***mesenteric fat shrinks***, ***widening these defects*** and allowing bowel to herniate through them. This is a complication of successful weight loss, paradoxically.

**Clinical features**: Intermittent or acute colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (symptoms of small bowel obstruction). Can cause ***closed-loop obstruction*** → bowel strangulation → ischaemia → necrosis → perforation → peritonitis. This can be **catastrophic** if delayed.

**Investigation**: ***CT abdomen*** — ***"swirl sign"*** (mesenteric vascular rotation), clustered small bowel loops, closed-loop configuration, mesenteric oedema [2]

**Management**: ***Urgent laparoscopic surgical exploration*** → reduce hernia, assess bowel viability (pink and peristalsing = viable; dusky/black/non-peristalsing = non-viable → resect), ***close all mesenteric defects with non-absorbable suture*** [2]

**Prevention**: ***Routine closure of all mesenteric defects at the time of index RYGB*** — this is now standard practice but was not always done historically

<Callout title="Exam Pearl">
Internal hernia is the diagnosis you must always consider when a post-RYGB patient presents with abdominal pain — even years after surgery. The CT "swirl sign" is pathognomonic. A normal CT does not fully exclude intermittent internal hernia (bowel may spontaneously reduce). If clinical suspicion is high despite normal imaging, diagnostic laparoscopy is warranted.
</Callout>

### 3.2 Dumping Syndrome

***Dumping syndrome*** is a constellation of vasomotor and GI symptoms caused by ***rapid transit of hyperosmolar gastric contents into the small intestine*** after loss of the pyloric sphincter mechanism [2][5][6].

**Primarily affects RYGB** (pylorus completely bypassed). Rare after SG (pylorus preserved). Also occurs after any gastrectomy (Billroth I/II) — the pathophysiology is identical [5][6].

#### Early Dumping (15–30 minutes post-meal)

**Pathophysiology**:
1. Hyperosmolar chyme (especially concentrated sugars) rushes into the jejunum
2. ***Osmotic fluid shift*** from plasma into the intestinal lumen (the gut acts like a dialysis membrane — water follows the osmotic gradient)
3. ***Intravascular volume depletion*** → tachycardia, hypotension, dizziness, flushing, diaphoresis
4. ***Intestinal distension*** → cramping, nausea, bloating, explosive diarrhoea
5. ***Release of vasoactive gut hormones*** (serotonin, VIP, bradykinin, neurotensin) → further vasodilation and flushing

**Symptoms**: Abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, nausea, bloating, ***vasomotor symptoms*** (tachycardia, flushing, diaphoresis, dizziness, weakness) [5][6]

#### Late Dumping (1–3 hours post-meal)

**Pathophysiology**:
1. Rapid carbohydrate absorption in the jejunum → ***exaggerated glucose spike***
2. ***Exaggerated insulin release*** (both from the glucose spike and from enhanced GLP-1 secretion in the RYGB anatomy)
3. ***Reactive hypoglycaemia*** — insulin overshoots, glucose crashes
4. ***Counter-regulatory hormone release*** (adrenaline, glucagon, cortisol, GH) → adrenergic symptoms

**Symptoms**: ***Post-prandial hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia*** [5] — diaphoresis, tremor, palpitations, confusion, weakness, syncope. Can be severe enough to cause seizures.

#### Management [5][6]:

| Line | Intervention | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **1st line** | ***Dietary modification***: small frequent meals; avoid simple carbohydrates/refined sugars; separate solids and liquids; increase protein and fibre; lie down after meals | Slows gastric emptying of what remains of the pouch, reduces osmotic load, reduces glucose spike |
| **2nd line** | ***Acarbose*** (alpha-glucosidase inhibitor) — for **late dumping** specifically | Inhibits brush-border enzymes that break down complex carbohydrates into glucose → slows glucose absorption → blunts insulin spike → prevents reactive hypoglycaemia |
| **3rd line** | ***Octreotide*** (somatostatin analogue) — SC injection | Inhibits multiple gut hormones (insulin, GLP-1, VIP, serotonin) → reduces both vasomotor symptoms and hypoglycaemia. Delays GI transit. Reserved for refractory cases |

<Callout title="Dumping Syndrome as 'Therapeutic'" type="idea">
As mentioned in the management section, dumping actually reinforces good dietary behaviour post-RYGB. Patients who eat sweets or high-GI foods feel terrible → they learn to avoid them. This conditioned aversion contributes to long-term weight maintenance. Some surgeons consider mild dumping a beneficial "side effect" rather than a true complication.
</Callout>

### 3.3 Marginal Ulcer (RYGB-Specific)

***Anastomotic stricture*** is a narrowing; ***marginal ulcer*** is an ulceration — both occur at the gastrojejunal anastomosis of RYGB [2][5].

**Pathophysiology**: The gastrojejunal anastomosis exposes ***jejunal mucosa to gastric acid***. Unlike gastric/duodenal mucosa, jejunal mucosa has **no protective mucus-bicarbonate barrier** and is not adapted to acidic pH → ulceration at the margin ("marginal ulcer").

**Risk factors** (modifiable):
- ***NSAIDs*** — inhibit prostaglandin synthesis → reduce mucosal blood flow and bicarbonate secretion → universal NSAID avoidance lifelong after RYGB
- ***Smoking*** — nicotine causes mucosal vasoconstriction → tissue ischaemia
- ***H. pylori*** — if present in the gastric pouch or remnant → acid hypersecretion → ulceration
- ***Ischaemia at the anastomosis*** — surgical technique
- Corticosteroid use

**Incidence**: 1–16% (varies widely by series and risk factor profile)

**Clinical features**: Epigastric pain, GI bleeding (haematemesis, melaena), nausea, anaemia

**Investigation**: ***OGD*** — direct visualisation and biopsy (rule out malignancy, test for *H. pylori*). Seen as an ulcer crater at the jejunal side of the gastrojejunostomy.

**Management**: High-dose PPI (omeprazole 40 mg BD), stop NSAIDs, smoking cessation, eradicate *H. pylori*, sucralfate. If refractory → surgical revision (excision of ulcer, revision of gastrojejunostomy, or vagotomy) [5]

### 3.4 Anastomotic Stricture / Stomal Stenosis

**Incidence**: 3–12% after RYGB (at the gastrojejunostomy); can also occur in SG (narrowing at the incisura angularis — the natural bend of the lesser curvature)

**Pathophysiology**: Healing of the anastomosis/staple line → fibrosis → cicatricial narrowing. Also ischaemia, marginal ulceration, and technical factors contribute.

**Timing**: Typically 4–8 weeks post-op

**Clinical features**: Progressive dysphagia (solids > liquids), nausea, vomiting, intolerance of solid food, weight loss (beyond expected)

**Investigation**: OGD (therapeutic and diagnostic) or barium swallow (shows narrowing)

**Management**: ***Endoscopic balloon dilation*** — first-line treatment. Usually requires 1–3 sessions. Rarely requires surgical revision [2]

### 3.5 Nutritional Deficiencies

This is the most common long-term complication category and the reason ***lifelong follow-up and supplementation are mandatory*** [2][5][6][7].

| Deficiency | Mechanism (First Principles) | Clinical Manifestation | Procedure Most Affected |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Iron deficiency*** | ***↓ Gastric acid*** (needed to convert Fe³⁺ → Fe²⁺, the absorbable form) + ***bypassed duodenum*** (main iron absorption site — DMT1 transporters) + ***GI bleeding from anastomotic ulcers*** [5][7] | ***Microcytic hypochromic anaemia***, fatigue, koilonychia, glossitis, pica | RYGB > SG > banding |
| ***Vitamin B12 deficiency*** | ***↓ Intrinsic factor*** (from reduced parietal cell mass in SG; or bypassed gastric remnant in RYGB) + ***↓ gastric acid*** (needed to cleave B12 from food proteins) [5] | ***Megaloblastic anaemia***, peripheral neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration of the cord (posterior and lateral column demyelination → ataxia, loss of vibration/proprioception, spasticity), cognitive impairment | RYGB > SG |
| ***Folate deficiency*** | Absorbed in ***proximal jejunum*** — bypassed in RYGB. Also dietary inadequacy (reduced food variety post-surgery) | ***Megaloblastic anaemia***, neural tube defects in pregnancy | RYGB >> SG |
| ***Calcium deficiency*** | ***Bypassed duodenum*** (site of active, vitamin D-dependent calcium absorption via TRPV6 channels) + ***fat malabsorption*** (calcium binds to unabsorbed fatty acids → excreted as calcium soaps) [7] | Hypocalcaemia → perioral paraesthesia, carpopedal spasm (Trousseau sign), Chvostek sign. Chronic: ***osteomalacia, osteopenia, osteoporosis*** | RYGB > BPD-DS >> SG |
| ***Vitamin D deficiency*** | Fat-soluble vitamin → ***impaired absorption*** with fat malabsorption (shorter common channel in RYGB/BPD-DS). Also: obese patients have baseline deficiency (vitamin D sequestered in adipose tissue — ↓ bioavailability) | Osteomalacia (adults), ***secondary hyperparathyroidism*** (↓ Ca²⁺ → ↑ PTH → bone resorption → metabolic bone disease), proximal myopathy, bone pain | RYGB > SG |
| ***Thiamine (B1) deficiency*** | Thiamine stores are depleted within 2–3 weeks of inadequate intake. ***Prolonged postoperative vomiting*** (from stenosis, overeating, or any cause) rapidly depletes thiamine. Absorbed in jejunum — bypassed in RYGB | ***Wernicke encephalopathy*** — the triad: **confusion, ophthalmoplegia (lateral rectus palsy → diplopia, nystagmus), ataxia**. If untreated → Korsakoff syndrome (irreversible confabulation and anterograde amnesia) | RYGB = SG (any procedure with prolonged vomiting) |
| **Zinc deficiency** | Absorbed in duodenum/proximal jejunum (bypassed). ***Zinc binds to unabsorbed fatty acids*** [7] | ***Impaired wound healing, alopecia, dysgeusia (altered taste), immune dysfunction, growth retardation (paediatric)*** | RYGB > SG |
| **Copper deficiency** | Absorbed in duodenum/proximal jejunum. ***Excess zinc supplementation competes for absorption*** (shared transporter — ZIP4/DMT1) → iatrogenic copper deficiency | ***Anaemia (refractory to iron), neutropaenia, myelopathy*** (mimics B12 deficiency — posterior column demyelination) | RYGB (especially if over-supplementing zinc) |
| **Protein-calorie malnutrition** | Severe restriction (too small a pouch/sleeve) + malabsorption (RYGB/BPD-DS) + dietary non-compliance (avoiding protein-rich foods) | Hypoalbuminaemia → oedema, hair loss, muscle wasting, impaired immunity, poor wound healing | BPD-DS >> RYGB > SG |

***Follow-up nutritional monitoring*** [2]:

- ***After banding***: CBC, RFT, HbA1c, FBG, lipids
- ***After bypass / sleeve gastrectomy***: Above ***+ LFT, B12/folate, Fe profile, bone profile (Ca, PO₄, vitamin D, PTH), Zn, Cu***

<Callout title="Metabolic Bone Disease — The Silent Complication" type="error">
***Metabolic bone disease*** is the most underappreciated long-term complication [7]. The cascade: fat malabsorption → ↓ vitamin D absorption → ↓ intestinal calcium absorption → chronic hypocalcaemia → ***secondary hyperparathyroidism*** → PTH drives osteoclastic bone resorption → ***osteopenia → osteoporosis → fragility fractures***. This process is insidious — patients are asymptomatic until they fracture a hip. Prevention requires lifelong calcium citrate + vitamin D supplementation + annual monitoring of Ca, vitamin D, and PTH + DEXA scan every 2 years post-RYGB [7].
</Callout>

### 3.6 Gallstones (Cholelithiasis)

**Incidence**: Up to ***30% of bariatric surgery patients*** develop gallstones within the first 6–12 months

**Pathophysiology** [7]:
1. ***Rapid weight loss*** → liver mobilises large amounts of cholesterol from adipose stores → ***supersaturation of bile with cholesterol***
2. ***Decreased gallbladder motility*** — reduced meal volume post-surgery → less CCK release → less gallbladder contraction → ***bile stasis*** → sludge → stones
3. Both mechanisms favour ***cholesterol gallstones***

**Prevention**: ***Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)*** 300 mg BD for 6 months post-surgery — reduces bile cholesterol saturation. Some centres perform concurrent cholecystectomy if gallstones found preoperatively.

**Management if symptomatic**: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy

### 3.7 Kidney Stones (Nephrolithiasis)

**Pathophysiology** (especially after RYGB/BPD-DS with significant malabsorption) [7]:
- Fat malabsorption → unabsorbed fatty acids in the gut lumen bind to ***calcium*** (forming calcium soaps) → ***less free calcium*** available to bind oxalate
- Unbound ***oxalate*** is absorbed in the colon → hyperoxaluria → filtered by kidneys → ***calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis***

**Prevention**: Adequate hydration, low-oxalate diet (avoid spinach, rhubarb, chocolate, tea, nuts), calcium supplementation (paradoxically — more calcium binds oxalate in the gut, reducing absorption), potassium citrate (alkalinises urine, reduces stone formation)

### 3.8 GORD — Worsening After Sleeve Gastrectomy

**Pathophysiology** [2]:
1. SG creates a ***high-pressure tube*** from the narrow sleeve → increased intragastric pressure
2. ***Disruption of the angle of His*** (natural anti-reflux mechanism) during fundus resection
3. ***Possible LES injury*** during dissection near the GEJ
4. ***Hiatal hernia*** may be unmasked or worsened

**Incidence**: De novo GORD in 10–30% of SG patients; worsening of pre-existing GORD in up to 50%

**Clinical features**: Heartburn, acid regurgitation, nocturnal cough, oesophagitis on OGD, Barrett's oesophagus (long-term)

**Management**: PPI (first-line); if refractory → ***conversion from SG to RYGB*** (definitive — RYGB is the best anti-reflux bariatric procedure) [2]

### 3.9 Weight Regain

**Incidence**: ~20–30% of patients experience clinically significant weight regain (defined as regain of > 25% of lost weight) by 5 years

**Causes**:
- ***Dietary non-compliance*** — most common (snacking, calorie-dense liquids, emotional eating)
- ***Pouch/sleeve dilation*** — gradual stretching of the gastric pouch or sleeve over years → accommodates more food → reduced restrictive effect
- ***Gastrogastric fistula*** (RYGB) — fistula between pouch and excluded remnant → food enters the large remnant → reduced restriction and malabsorption
- ***Metabolic adaptation*** — some hormonal changes partially revert over time (ghrelin may increase, GLP-1 effect may diminish)
- ***Psychological*** — untreated binge eating disorder, depression, addiction transfer

**Management**: Multidisciplinary re-engagement (dietitian, psychologist); pharmacotherapy adjunct (GLP-1 RA); endoscopic revision (TORe for RYGB, endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty); surgical revision (SG → RYGB conversion, RYGB limb lengthening, conversion to BPD-DS)

### 3.10 Psychological Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Depression** | Body image issues (excess skin), unmet expectations, loss of food as coping mechanism, neurochemical changes |
| ***Addiction transfer*** | Loss of food reward → substitution with alcohol, gambling, compulsive shopping. RYGB patients are especially vulnerable to alcohol (reduced first-pass metabolism → higher blood alcohol levels from same amount) |
| **Suicide** | Risk of suicide is increased post-bariatric surgery (multiple studies). Multifactorial: pre-existing psychiatric comorbidity, persistent body image dissatisfaction, relationship changes, ongoing depression. Emphasises importance of ***preoperative screening and lifelong psychological support*** |
| **Binge eating disorder relapse** | If untreated pre-operatively, BED often recurs → weight regain, psychological distress |

## 4. Procedure-Specific Complication Summary

| Complication | Gastric Banding | Sleeve Gastrectomy | RYGB | BPD-DS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ***Staple line/anastomotic leak*** | N/A (no staples) | ***Leak at angle of His*** (slow to heal) [2] | ***Leak at gastrojejunostomy*** | Leak at anastomosis |
| **Bleeding** | Rare | ***Staple line bleed*** | Staple line + anastomotic bleed | Staple line bleed |
| ***Band slip/erosion*** | ***Yes*** (band migrates or erodes into stomach) [2] | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| ***Access port infection*** | ***Yes*** [2] | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Tubing leak** | ***Yes*** [2] | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| ***GORD*** | May improve | ***Worsening*** (↑ intragastric pressure, loss of angle of His, LES injury) [2] | ***Improves*** (best for GORD) | Improves |
| ***Internal hernia*** | No | No | ***Yes*** (Petersen's defect, JJ mesenteric defect) [2] | Yes |
| ***Marginal ulcer*** | No | No | ***Yes*** (jejunal mucosa exposed to acid) | Possible |
| ***Anastomotic stricture*** | No (but band can cause narrowing) | Narrowing at incisura angularis | ***Yes*** (gastrojejunostomy) [2] | Yes |
| ***Dumping syndrome*** | No | Rare (pylorus preserved) | ***Yes*** (pylorus bypassed) [2] | Yes |
| ***Nutritional deficiency*** | Low | ***Moderate*** (B12, iron, VitD) | ***High*** (Fe, B12, folate, Ca, VitD, fat-soluble vitamins) [2] | ***Very high*** |
| ***Weight regain*** | ***High*** (30–50% failure) [2] | Moderate | Lower (but still 20–30%) | Lowest |
| ***Malnutrition*** | Rare | Uncommon | ***Moderate risk*** [2] | ***High risk*** [2] |

---

## 5. Special Topic: TPN-Associated Complications

When bariatric surgery patients require prolonged NPO (e.g., leak management, severe stricture, fistula), ***TPN becomes necessary*** [3][6][7]:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI)*** | Biofilm formation on central line → bacteraemia. Most feared PN complication. Prevent with aseptic insertion technique, daily line care, prompt removal when no longer needed [3] |
| ***TPN-associated cholestasis / hepatic steatosis*** | Lack of enteral stimulation → ***↓ CCK release*** → gallbladder stasis → biliary sludge → cholestasis. Also: excess glucose/lipid in TPN → hepatic lipogenesis → steatosis [3][6] |
| ***Refeeding syndrome*** | When transitioning from NPO/TPN back to enteral feeding (or initiating TPN in a malnourished patient): sudden carbohydrate load → insulin surge → intracellular shift of ***PO₄ (first and most important), K⁺, Mg²⁺, thiamine*** → cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, respiratory failure, seizures [3][6] |
| **Catheter thrombosis** | Foreign body in central vein → thrombosis → SVC syndrome, loss of access |
| **Metabolic derangements** | Hyperglycaemia (most common), hypertriglyceridaemia, electrolyte imbalances |
| ***Gut mucosal atrophy*** | No enteral stimulation → villous atrophy → ***bacterial translocation*** (gut bacteria cross into portal circulation → sepsis) — this is why ***"if the gut works, use it"*** [3] |

<Callout title="Refeeding Syndrome — Key Details">
***Electrolyte disturbance priority*** [6]: ↓PO₄ (***first*** — phosphate is consumed to produce ATP during the metabolic shift from fat to carbohydrate oxidation) > ↓K⁺ > ↓Mg²⁺ > ↓thiamine.

***Prevention***: Start feeding at 10 kcal/kg/day ("start low, go slow"), increase gradually over 4–7 days. Monitor electrolytes (especially phosphate) BD for the first week. Supplement prophylactically: IV Pabrinex (thiamine), oral/IV phosphate, potassium, magnesium. ***High-risk patients***: BMI < 18.5, > 10% weight loss in 3–6 months, little/no intake for > 5 days, low baseline PO₄/K⁺/Mg²⁺, alcohol misuse, cancer cachexia [3][6].

## 6. Mortality

| Procedure | 30-Day Mortality | Main Causes of Death |
|---|---|---|
| Gastric banding | ~0.05% | PE, anaesthetic complications |
| Sleeve gastrectomy | ~0.1–0.3% | Staple line leak → sepsis, PE |
| RYGB | ~0.2–0.5% | Anastomotic leak → sepsis, PE, cardiac events |
| BPD-DS | ~0.5–1% | Leak, PE, malnutrition-related complications |

> Overall bariatric surgery mortality is **very low** — comparable to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The long-term survival benefit of bariatric surgery (reduction in cardiovascular death, cancer death, and all-cause mortality by 30–40% over 10–20 years, per the Swedish Obese Subjects study) far outweighs the perioperative risk.

---

> **Key Complications Principles — Summary:**
> 1. ***Tachycardia = leak until proven otherwise*** — CT with oral contrast is the investigation of choice.
> 2. ***VTE is a leading cause of perioperative death*** — aggressive prophylaxis mandatory (LMWH + compression + early mobilisation).
> 3. ***Internal hernia is RYGB-specific*** — presents late as weight loss widens mesenteric defects. CT swirl sign. Urgent surgery.
> 4. ***Dumping syndrome*** — early (osmotic, vasomotor) vs late (reactive hypoglycaemia). Dietary modification first; acarbose for late; octreotide for refractory.
> 5. ***Nutritional deficiencies are lifelong*** — iron, B12, folate, calcium, vitamin D, thiamine, zinc, copper. RYGB > SG. Annual monitoring mandatory.
> 6. ***Metabolic bone disease is the silent killer*** — secondary hyperparathyroidism from Ca/VitD malabsorption → osteoporosis → fragility fractures.
> 7. ***GORD may worsen after SG*** — if intractable, convert to RYGB.
> 8. ***Gallstones in 30%*** within first year — ursodeoxycholic acid prophylaxis.
> 9. ***Avoid NSAIDs lifelong after RYGB*** — marginal ulcer risk.
> 10. ***Psychological complications*** including addiction transfer and increased suicide risk — lifelong support essential.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of Bariatric Surgery">

**Early**: Leak (tachycardia — sentinel sign; CT with oral contrast), staple line bleed, VTE (leading cause of death), respiratory complications (atelectasis, OSA exacerbation), rhabdomyolysis, wound infection.

**Late**: Internal hernia (RYGB — swirl sign on CT), marginal ulcer (RYGB — avoid NSAIDs), dumping syndrome (early = osmotic/vasomotor; late = reactive hypoglycaemia), stomal stenosis, nutritional deficiencies (Fe, B12, folate, Ca, VitD, thiamine, Zn, Cu — lifelong monitoring), gallstones (30% in year 1 — UDCA prophylaxis), GORD worsening (SG — may need conversion to RYGB), nephrolithiasis (oxalate), weight regain, psychological complications (addiction transfer, depression, suicide).

**Procedure-specific**: Banding → slip/erosion/port infection; SG → leak at angle of His (slow to heal), GORD; RYGB → internal hernia, marginal ulcer, dumping, nutritional deficiency; BPD-DS → severe malnutrition.

**Follow-up monitoring**: After banding: CBC, RFT, HbA1c, FBG, lipids. After bypass/SG: add LFT, B12/folate, Fe profile, bone profile (Ca, PO₄, VitD, PTH), Zn, Cu.

      question: "Explain the pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism after RYGB. What is the cascade from malabsorption to bone disease?",
      markscheme: "RYGB bypasses the duodenum (site of active calcium absorption) and causes fat malabsorption (reduced fat-soluble vitamin D absorption). Low vitamin D reduces intestinal calcium absorption further. Chronic hypocalcaemia stimulates PTH release from parathyroid glands (secondary hyperparathyroidism). PTH drives osteoclastic bone resorption to maintain serum calcium, leading to osteopenia, osteoporosis, and ultimately fragility fractures. Prevention: lifelong calcium citrate plus vitamin D supplementation, annual monitoring of Ca, vitamin D, PTH, and DEXA every 2 years.",
    },
    {
      question: "Compare early and late dumping syndrome: timing, pathophysiology, key symptoms, and specific pharmacotherapy for each.",
      markscheme: "Early dumping: 15-30 min post-meal. Hyperosmolar chyme enters jejunum rapidly (pylorus bypassed), causing osmotic fluid shift into gut lumen leading to intravascular depletion plus gut distension plus vasoactive hormone release. Symptoms: abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, nausea, vasomotor (tachycardia, flushing, diaphoresis). Treatment: dietary modification (first-line). Late dumping: 1-3 hours post-meal. Rapid glucose absorption causes exaggerated insulin release leading to reactive hypoglycaemia. Symptoms: diaphoresis, tremor, confusion, palpitations, weakness. Specific pharmacotherapy: acarbose (alpha-glucosidase inhibitor — slows carbohydrate digestion, blunts glucose spike and insulin overshoot). Refractory cases: octreotide.",
    },
    {
      question: "A patient presents 18 months post-RYGB with intermittent colicky abdominal pain and vomiting. CT shows a swirl sign. What is the diagnosis, why did it present now, and what is the management?",
      markscheme: "Diagnosis: internal hernia through a mesenteric defect (Petersen space or JJ mesenteric defect). It presents now because significant weight loss has reduced mesenteric fat, widening the defects and allowing bowel to herniate. Management: urgent laparoscopic surgical exploration — reduce hernia, assess bowel viability (resect if non-viable), close all mesenteric defects with non-absorbable suture.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why do 30% of bariatric surgery patients develop gallstones in the first year? Name two pathophysiological mechanisms and one prophylactic measure.",
      markscheme: "1. Rapid weight loss causes hepatic mobilisation of large amounts of cholesterol from adipose stores, supersaturating bile with cholesterol. 2. Reduced meal volume post-surgery causes decreased CCK release, leading to decreased gallbladder contraction and bile stasis, promoting sludge and stone formation. Prophylaxis: ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 300 mg BD for 6 months post-surgery (reduces bile cholesterol saturation).",
    },
    {
      question: "List the nutritional monitoring panel required after RYGB or sleeve gastrectomy, and explain why it differs from that after gastric banding.",
      markscheme: "After banding: CBC, RFT, HbA1c, FBG, lipids — minimal malabsorption so basic metabolic monitoring suffices. After RYGB or SG: all of the above PLUS LFT, vitamin B12, folate, iron profile, bone profile (calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, PTH), zinc, copper. The extended panel is needed because RYGB bypasses the duodenum and proximal jejunum (reducing iron, calcium, B12, folate, fat-soluble vitamin absorption) and SG reduces gastric acid and intrinsic factor (impairing B12 and iron absorption). These deficiencies are lifelong and progressive without supplementation and monitoring.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is rhabdomyolysis in the bariatric surgery context? Explain the mechanism, name the key investigation finding, and outline the management.",
      markscheme: "Mechanism: prolonged operative time plus morbid obesity causes extreme pressure on gluteal and posterior thigh muscles during surgical positioning, resulting in crush injury and myocyte necrosis. Released myoglobin is filtered by kidneys, precipitates in renal tubules causing obstruction and acute kidney injury. Key investigation: markedly elevated serum CK (often greater than 5000 U/L), plus dark cola-coloured urine (myoglobinuria), rising creatinine, hyperkalaemia. Management: aggressive IV fluid resuscitation (target UO greater than 200 mL/hr), alkalinise urine with IV sodium bicarbonate (keeps myoglobin soluble), monitor and treat hyperkalaemia, avoid nephrotoxins. Prevention: adequate padding, minimise operative time.",
