## Differential Diagnosis in the Context of Bariatric Surgery

The differential diagnosis (DDx) in bariatric surgery operates on **two distinct clinical axes**. First, before surgery, you must differentiate **primary (idiopathic) obesity** from **secondary causes of obesity** — because operating on a patient whose obesity is driven by a reversible endocrine or pharmacological cause is a contraindication [2]. Second, after surgery, you must differentiate the **expected post-operative course** from **complications that mimic other conditions**. Both are fair game in exams.

### Axis 1: Differential Diagnosis of Obesity — Before Bariatric Surgery

The question here is: **Why is this patient obese?** Most obesity (~95%) is **primary/exogenous** (caloric excess + sedentary lifestyle + polygenic predisposition). However, you must ***exclude reversible causes*** before committing a patient to irreversible surgery [2].

Think systematically using the mnemonic **"COMES"**:

| Category | Condition | Mechanism / Why it causes obesity | Key Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C — Cushing syndrome** | Excess cortisol (exogenous steroids, pituitary adenoma, adrenal tumour, ectopic ACTH) | Cortisol → ↑ gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance, ↑ appetite, preferential visceral fat deposition (central obesity), protein catabolism (thin limbs) | ***Central obesity with thin extremities***, moon face, buffalo hump, striae (wide, purple — unlike simple obesity which has narrow, pale striae), proximal myopathy, easy bruising, hypertension, hyperglycaemia |
| **O — Other endocrine** | **Hypothyroidism** | ↓ Basal metabolic rate → reduced energy expenditure; also myxoedema (mucopolysaccharide deposition → non-pitting oedema that adds weight) | Fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, bradycardia, delayed relaxation of ankle jerks. Weight gain is usually modest (5–10 kg), rarely causes morbid obesity alone |
| | **Insulinoma** | Excess insulin → recurrent hypoglycaemia → compensatory ↑ eating (defensive eating to prevent hypoglycaemia) + anabolic effect of insulin (lipogenesis) | Whipple's triad: symptoms of hypoglycaemia, documented low glucose ( < 2.5 mmol/L), resolution with glucose administration. Episodes often fasting-related |
| | **Growth hormone deficiency** | GH promotes lipolysis; deficiency → ↑ fat mass (especially visceral), ↓ lean mass | Central adiposity, reduced muscle mass, fatigue, ↓ bone density. Usually in context of panhypopituitarism |
| | **Hypogonadism** | Testosterone promotes lean mass and lipolysis; deficiency → ↑ visceral fat. Oestrogen excess in males → gynoid fat distribution | Males: ↓ libido, erectile dysfunction, gynaecomastia, reduced body hair. Females: amenorrhoea (but note PCOS can cause both hyperandrogenism and obesity) |
| **M — Medications** | Corticosteroids, insulin, sulfonylureas, atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, clozapine), valproate, SSRIs/mirtazapine, β-blockers, TZDs | Various: ↑ appetite (central mechanisms), ↓ metabolic rate, insulin resistance, lipogenesis, fluid retention | Temporal relationship between drug initiation and weight gain. Always take a thorough drug history! |
| **E — Eating disorders** | Binge eating disorder (BED) | Recurrent episodes of uncontrolled large-volume eating without compensatory purging → chronic caloric excess | Eating large amounts when not hungry, eating until uncomfortably full, eating alone due to embarrassment, marked distress. Present in ~25–50% of bariatric surgery candidates — must screen |
| **S — Syndromic/Genetic** | Prader-Willi syndrome | Hypothalamic dysfunction → insatiable appetite (hyperphagia), ↓ GH → ↓ lean mass | Childhood onset, intellectual disability, short stature, hypogonadism, hypotonia in infancy |
| | Bardet-Biedl syndrome | Ciliopathy → hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction | Retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, renal anomalies, intellectual disability |
| | MC4R mutations | Most common monogenic cause of obesity; melanocortin 4 receptor deficiency → disrupted hypothalamic satiety signalling | Severe early-onset obesity, hyperphagia, tall stature, hyperinsulinaemia |
| | Leptin/leptin receptor deficiency | Extremely rare; absent leptin signal → hypothalamus never receives "full" signal | Severe early-onset obesity, hypogonadism. Responds to exogenous leptin if leptin-deficient (not receptor-deficient) |

<Callout title="Exam Approach: Secondary Obesity" type="idea">
On an exam, if a patient has features suggesting secondary obesity (e.g., striae that are wide and purple, proximal myopathy, virilisation, childhood onset with intellectual disability), **name the condition and state that it must be excluded/treated before considering bariatric surgery**. The key principle: ***reversible causes of obesity are a contraindication to bariatric surgery*** [2].

### Axis 2: Differential Diagnosis of Post-Bariatric Surgery Symptoms

After bariatric surgery, patients may present with symptoms that could represent **normal post-operative changes**, **expected physiological consequences**, or **serious complications**. The DDx here is symptom-driven.

#### A. Post-Bariatric Surgery: Acute Abdomen / Abdominal Pain

| Differential | Mechanism | Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Anastomotic leak*** | Disruption of staple line (SG) or surgical anastomosis (RYGB) → peritoneal contamination | ***Most feared early complication***. Tachycardia (often the earliest and most reliable sign — even before fever or pain), fever, peritonism, sepsis. CT with oral contrast: extravasation of contrast. Tachycardia > 120 bpm in the first 48 hours post-op = leak until proven otherwise |
| **Staple line bleed** | Bleeding from the long staple line (especially SG) | Tachycardia, hypotension, dropping Hb, blood per drain. Usually within first 24–48 hours |
| ***Internal hernia*** | Mesenteric defects created during RYGB allow bowel to herniate through → closed-loop obstruction → strangulation | ***Specific to RYGB***. Colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, signs of SBO. Can present months to years post-op, especially after significant weight loss (mesenteric fat loss widens defects). CT: "swirl sign" (mesenteric vascular rotation) |
| **Bowel obstruction** (adhesive) | Post-surgical adhesions (any abdominal surgery) | Colicky pain, distension, vomiting, absolute constipation. AXR/CT: dilated bowel with transition point |
| **Marginal ulcer** | Ulcer at the gastrojejunal anastomosis (RYGB) — due to acid exposure on unprotected jejunal mucosa, NSAIDs, smoking, *H. pylori* | Epigastric pain, GI bleeding (haematemesis/melaena). Risk factors: smoking, NSAIDs, *H. pylori* — all should be addressed preoperatively. Diagnosed by OGD |
| **Band slippage/erosion** (gastric banding) | Band slips → gastric prolapse through band → obstruction. Band erosion → penetration into gastric lumen | Acute dysphagia, vomiting, pain. X-ray: "O-sign" (horizontal band = slipped from normal oblique position) |
| **Cholelithiasis / cholecystitis** | Rapid weight loss → ↑ cholesterol saturation of bile (liver mobilises cholesterol from adipose stores) + ↓ gallbladder motility → gallstone formation | Right upper quadrant pain, Murphy's sign positive. Very common (up to 30% develop gallstones in first 6–12 months post-bariatric surgery). Some centres offer prophylactic ursodeoxycholic acid or concurrent cholecystectomy |
| **Acute pancreatitis** | Gallstone migration → ampullary obstruction; or hypertriglyceridaemia | Epigastric pain radiating to back, ↑ amylase/lipase |

#### B. Post-Bariatric Surgery: Nausea and Vomiting

| Differential | Mechanism | Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Overeating** (most common) | ***Restrictive mechanism*** — eating more than the small pouch/sleeve can accommodate | ***Upper abdominal pain and vomiting immediately after eating too much or too fast*** [2]. Self-limited. Patient education is key |
| **Stomal stenosis** | Scarring/narrowing at the gastrojejunal anastomosis (RYGB) or sleeve narrowing (usually at incisura angularis) | Progressive dysphagia, intolerance to solids > liquids. Usually 4–8 weeks post-op. Diagnosed by OGD/barium swallow. Treated by endoscopic balloon dilation |
| **Marginal ulcer** | As above | Epigastric pain ± bleeding |
| ***Internal hernia*** | As above | Intermittent colicky pain + vomiting (SBO pattern) |
| **GORD** (especially post-SG) | SG may worsen GORD: ↑ intragastric pressure in a narrow sleeve, disruption of angle of His, altered LES pressure | Heartburn, regurgitation, especially nocturnal. Chronic GORD post-SG may require conversion to RYGB |
| **Gastrogastric fistula** (RYGB) | Communication between the small gastric pouch and the excluded gastric remnant → food enters remnant → pain, GORD, weight regain | Weight regain + GORD symptoms post-RYGB. Diagnosed by upper GI series or OGD |

#### C. Post-Bariatric Surgery: Weight Loss Failure or Weight Regain

| Differential | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Dietary non-compliance** | Most common cause — snacking, high-calorie liquids (smoothies, sugary drinks) that bypass restriction |
| **Pouch/sleeve dilation** | Over time, pouch/sleeve stretches → accommodates more food → reduced restrictive effect |
| **Gastrogastric fistula** (RYGB) | Food enters excluded stomach → absorption from larger surface area |
| **Psychological/eating disorder** | Unaddressed binge eating disorder; emotional eating returns |
| **Inadequate initial procedure** | Pouch too large, limb lengths too short (RYGB) |

#### D. Post-Bariatric Surgery: Dumping Syndrome

***Dumping syndrome*** deserves special attention because it is very commonly tested [1][2]:

- **Early dumping** (15–30 minutes after eating):
  - *Mechanism*: After RYGB, food bypasses the pylorus → rapid delivery of hyperosmolar chyme into the jejunum → osmotic fluid shift into the gut lumen → intravascular volume depletion + gut distension
  - *Symptoms*: Nausea, cramping, diarrhoea, bloating, tachycardia, flushing, diaphoresis, dizziness (vasomotor symptoms from hypovolaemia and autonomic response)

- **Late dumping** (1–3 hours after eating):
  - *Mechanism*: Rapid glucose absorption → exaggerated insulin release → ***reactive hypoglycaemia***
  - *Symptoms*: Diaphoresis, tremor, weakness, confusion, palpitations (adrenergic counter-regulatory response to hypoglycaemia)

<Callout title="Why Dumping Syndrome Can Be 'Therapeutic'">
Interestingly, dumping syndrome after RYGB acts as a form of negative reinforcement — patients quickly learn to avoid simple sugars and high-glycaemic-index foods because they cause unpleasant symptoms. This contributes to long-term dietary modification and weight maintenance. It is a "feature, not a bug" of the RYGB design.

### Special DDx: Vomiting and Weight Loss — Gastric Cancer vs Post-Bariatric Surgery

This is particularly relevant given the ***gastric cancer lecture*** [1]. A patient with a history of bariatric surgery presenting with **weight loss and vomiting** can be diagnostically challenging:

| Feature | Post-Bariatric Surgery (Expected/Complication) | Gastric Cancer |
|---|---|---|
| **Weight loss** | Expected in first 12–18 months; concern if excessive or after plateau | ***Progressive, unintentional*** weight loss; often with anorexia and early satiety |
| **Vomiting** | Usually related to overeating, stomal stenosis, or dumping | ***Persistent***, may contain food eaten hours/days ago (gastric outlet obstruction); may have haematemesis |
| **Timing** | Early post-op period or related to eating patterns | Insidious onset, progressive |
| **Red flags** | Tachycardia (leak), peritonism, fever | ***Dysphagia (proximal tumour)***, ***palpable epigastric mass***, ***left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (Virchow's node)***, ***iron deficiency anaemia***, ***acanthosis nigricans (paraneoplastic — malignant type)*** |
| **Investigation** | CT with oral contrast (leak), OGD (stenosis, ulcer) | ***OGD with biopsy*** (gold standard for diagnosis), ***CT TAP for staging*** |

<Callout title="Critical Exam Point" type="error">
***Never assume*** that weight loss and vomiting in a bariatric surgery patient is simply from the surgery. Always consider the possibility of de novo pathology, including gastric cancer — especially if the gastric remnant (in RYGB) is not easily accessible by standard OGD. The excluded gastric remnant in RYGB is a "blind spot" — cancers arising here may present late. Some centres advocate preoperative OGD ± *H. pylori* eradication in all bariatric surgery candidates, especially in high-prevalence regions like East Asia [1][2].

### Summary Table: Key Differentials to Exclude Before and After Bariatric Surgery

| Timing | Key Differentials | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-operative** | Cushing syndrome, hypothyroidism, insulinoma, medication-induced obesity, genetic syndromes (Prader-Willi, MC4R), eating disorders | Endocrine workup (cortisol, TSH, glucose/insulin), drug history, psychological assessment, genetic testing if early-onset |
| **Early post-operative** ( < 30 days) | Anastomotic leak, staple line bleed, PE/DVT, bowel obstruction, rhabdomyolysis | CT with oral contrast, Hb monitoring, CTPA, CK levels |
| **Late post-operative** ( > 30 days) | Internal hernia, marginal ulcer, stomal stenosis, cholelithiasis, dumping syndrome, nutritional deficiencies, GORD (post-SG), weight regain | CT (swirl sign), OGD, barium swallow, RUQ USS, dietary assessment, micronutrient levels |

---

> **High Yield DDx Points for Exams:**
> 1. Always exclude secondary/reversible causes of obesity before bariatric surgery — especially Cushing syndrome and hypothyroidism.
> 2. Tachycardia > 120 bpm in first 48 hours post-bariatric surgery = anastomotic leak until proven otherwise.
> 3. Internal hernia is specific to RYGB (mesenteric defects) — look for "swirl sign" on CT.
> 4. Dumping syndrome = early (osmotic, vasomotor) vs late (reactive hypoglycaemia). More common after RYGB because pylorus is bypassed.
> 5. Gallstones are very common after rapid weight loss — up to 30% incidence in first year.
> 6. The excluded gastric remnant in RYGB is a "blind spot" for gastric cancer surveillance.
