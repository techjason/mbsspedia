## 1. Definition

**Spinal stenosis** literally breaks down as: "spinal" = relating to the spine, "stenosis" (Greek: _stenōsis_) = narrowing. So it is an **abnormal narrowing of the spinal canal, lateral recesses, or intervertebral (IV) foramina**, resulting in compression of the neural elements (spinal cord, cauda equina, or nerve roots) [1][2].

The key concept to grasp is that this is fundamentally a **space problem** — the neural structures need room, and when that room is taken away (by bone, disc, ligament, or a combination), you get symptoms. The clinical picture depends entirely on _where_ the narrowing is (cervical vs. lumbar, central vs. lateral) and _what_ gets compressed (cord vs. roots vs. cauda equina).

> **_Most common site: lumbar spine > cervical spine_** [2]. Thoracic stenosis is rare because the thoracic spine is relatively immobile (splinted by the rib cage), so it undergoes less degenerative wear.

<Callout title="Core Concept">
  Spinal stenosis is not a single disease — it is a **syndrome** caused by any
  process that narrows the spinal canal or foramina. The degenerative form is by
  far the most common, but always think about congenital, inflammatory,
  infective, and neoplastic causes.

## 2. Epidemiology

### Prevalence

- Spinal stenosis is the **most common reason for spinal surgery in patients over 65 years** of age.
- Radiographic lumbar stenosis (asymptomatic narrowing on imaging) is present in up to 20–30% of people over 60, but only a fraction are symptomatic — reinforcing that **clinical correlation is essential**.
- Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is the **most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults over 55** worldwide.

### Demographics

- **_Age: incidence rises sharply after age 50_** — this is a disease of the degenerating spine [2][3].
- **_Sex: slight male predominance_** [3].
- In Hong Kong and East Asia, there is a notably higher prevalence of **ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL)**, reported in **_up to 2–4% of Asian populations_** vs. < 0.5% in Western populations [4]. This is a crucial HK-relevant cause of cervical stenosis.

### Hong Kong Context

- Hong Kong has an ageing population with high rates of degenerative spinal disease.
- **_OPLL is much more common in Asian vs. non-Asian populations (up to 2–4%)_** with **_male predominance_** and tends to **_affect a younger population_** [4].
- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) — while less common than in Western populations — remains an important cause of cervical stenosis in HK, particularly C1/2 subluxation.
- Pott's disease (spinal TB) should always be on the differential in Hong Kong given endemic TB.

| Category                   | Risk Factors                                                                   | Mechanism                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **_Patient factors_**      | **_Ageing_**, **_male sex_**, **_smoking_** [3]                                | Ageing → disc desiccation, ligament hypertrophy, facet OA. Smoking → impaired disc nutrition via reduced vascular supply to endplates      |
| **_Mechanical factors_**   | **_Poor posture_**, **_weak paraspinal muscles_** [3]                          | Poor posture → abnormal loading → accelerated degeneration. Weak muscles → loss of dynamic stabilisation → more load on passive structures |
| **_Occupational factors_** | **_Heavy lifting_**, repetitive flexion/extension, whole-body vibration [3]    | Repeated mechanical stress → cumulative disc and facet damage                                                                              |
| Genetic/Developmental      | Congenitally narrow canal (**_short pedicles_**), familial OPLL, Down syndrome | Smaller baseline canal diameter means less "reserve" before symptoms develop — even minor degenerative changes become symptomatic          |
| Metabolic                  | Obesity, diabetes mellitus                                                     | Obesity → axial loading. DM → microvascular disease → impaired neural recovery                                                             |
| Comorbidities              | Osteoporosis, prior spinal fractures                                           | Vertebral body collapse → canal compromise                                                                                                 |

<Callout title="Developmental Stenosis — The 'Low Reserve' Concept" type="idea">
  Patients with ***developmental stenosis (short pedicles)*** have a
  constitutionally narrow canal. They are ***prone to symptoms at any level***
  [5] because even minor disc bulges or osteophytes that would be asymptomatic
  in a normal-sized canal become symptomatic here. Think of it as "starting with
  less room to spare." These patients also have higher ***reoperation rates: 13%
  of patients, 50% at adjacent levels, approximately 3.3% per year*** [5].

## 4. Anatomy and Function

Understanding spinal stenosis requires a solid grasp of the anatomy of the spinal canal and its contents.

### 4.1 The Spinal Canal

The spinal canal is a bony tube formed by:

- **Anteriorly**: Vertebral bodies + intervertebral discs + posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL)
- **Laterally**: Pedicles
- **Posteriorly**: Laminae + ligamentum flavum + facet joints

The **intervertebral foramen** (neural foramen) is bounded by:

- Superiorly and inferiorly: Pedicles of adjacent vertebrae
- Anteriorly: Vertebral body, disc, and uncovertebral joint (cervical)
- Posteriorly: Facet joint (zygapophyseal joint) and its capsule

The **lateral recess** is the space between the posterior aspect of the vertebral body and the superior articular process of the level below — a critical zone where the traversing nerve root sits before exiting at the foramen below.

### 4.2 Contents

| Level                      | Canal Contents                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cervical (C1–C7)**       | Spinal cord (cervical enlargement C5–T1 for brachial plexus)     |
| **Thoracolumbar junction** | Conus medullaris (cord termination, typically L1–L2 in adults)   |
| **Lumbar (below L2)**      | Cauda equina (nerve roots floating in CSF within the thecal sac) |

This distinction is **critical** because:

- Compression **above L2** → upper motor neuron (UMN) signs (myelopathy)
- Compression **below L2** → lower motor neuron (LMN) signs (cauda equina / radiculopathy)

### 4.3 Canal Dimensions

**Cervical spine measurements** [6]:

- **_Midsagittal diameter of the spinal canal (a)_**:
  - Normal: ≥ 17 mm
  - **_Relative stenosis if < 12 mm; absolute stenosis if < 10 mm_**
- **_Dynamic stenosis (b)_**: distance from posteroinferior corner of cranial vertebra to anterosuperior edge of caudal lamina — **_dynamic stenosis if < 12 mm_**
- **_Olisthesis (c)_**: slip distance
- **_Pavlov ratio_** (ratio of AP diameter of canal to diameter of vertebral body at the same level): **< 0.8 suggests stenosis** [2]

**Lumbar spine**:

- Normal AP diameter: ~15–25 mm
- Stenosis: < 12 mm (relative), < 10 mm (absolute)
- Cross-sectional area: < 100 mm² suggests significant stenosis

### 4.4 The Intervertebral Disc

The disc has two components:

1. **Nucleus pulposus (NP)**: gelatinous core, high in water and proteoglycans (especially aggrecan) — acts as a hydraulic shock absorber
2. **Annulus fibrosus (AF)**: concentric rings of collagen — contains the NP and resists tensile forces

With ageing, the NP loses aggrecan and water content → becomes more fibrous → can no longer evenly distribute compressive forces → stress is transferred to the AF and facet joints → this drives the entire degenerative cascade.

### 4.5 Ligaments Relevant to Stenosis

| Ligament                                  | Location                                                 | Role in Stenosis                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (PLL)** | Posterior surface of vertebral bodies, inside the canal  | Can ossify (**_OPLL_**) → directly compresses cord/roots anteriorly                              |
| **Ligamentum Flavum (LF)**                | Connects adjacent laminae, lines posterior wall of canal | Hypertrophies with degeneration → compresses cord/roots posteriorly. Can also ossify (**_OLF_**) |
| **Anterior Longitudinal Ligament (ALL)**  | Anterior surface of vertebral bodies                     | Rarely causes stenosis directly, but relevant in surgical planning                               |

### 4.6 Nerve Root Anatomy — The Mismatch Concept

This is a classic exam concept:

**Cervical spine**: There are **8** cervical nerve roots but only **7** cervical vertebrae. The C1–C7 nerve roots exit **above** their corresponding pedicle (e.g., C6 root exits above C6 pedicle). The C8 root exits between C7 and T1. This means:

- **_A C6/7 disc (whether central or foraminal) affects the same nerve root (C7)_** — there is a **pedicle/nerve root mismatch** above and including C7, then the extra C8 root (without a corresponding C8 vertebral body) allows **transition from mismatch to match** [3].

**Lumbar spine**: Nerve roots exit **below** their corresponding pedicle (e.g., L4 root exits below L4 pedicle). This means:

- **_Pedicle/nerve root MATCH in the lumbar spine_** [3]
- A **posterolateral** L4/5 disc herniation compresses the **L5** root (the traversing root)
- A **far lateral (foraminal)** L4/5 disc herniation compresses the **L4** root (the exiting root)

<Callout title="Cervical vs. Lumbar Disc — Which Root Gets Hit?" type="error">
  This is a common exam pitfall. In the **cervical spine**, both a central and
  foraminal disc at the same level tend to affect the **same** nerve root. In
  the **lumbar spine**, a posterolateral disc affects the **traversing** root
  (one level below), while a far lateral disc affects the **exiting** root (same
  level). You must know the mismatch-to-match transition concept [3].
</Callout>

## 5. Etiology (with Focus on Hong Kong)

The causes can be broadly classified as **congenital/developmental** vs. **acquired**.

### 5.1 Congenital / Developmental Stenosis

- **_Short pedicles_** → constitutionally narrow canal [5]
- Achondroplasia (short pedicles + thick laminae)
- Down syndrome (atlanto-axial instability due to absent/lax transverse ligament)
- Congenital vertebral anomalies (e.g., block vertebrae, Klippel-Feil syndrome)

### 5.2 Acquired Stenosis

#### A. Degenerative (by far the most common cause)

This is the **Kirkaldy-Willis degenerative cascade** [7], which describes a predictable three-phase process:

| Phase                        | Facet Joints                                                | Disc                                                | Result                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Phase 1: Dysfunction_**   | **_Synovitis, hypermobility_**                              | **_Circumferential tears_**                         | **_Dysfunction_**                                              |
| **_Phase 2: Instability_**   | **_Continuing degeneration, capsular laxity, subluxation_** | **_Radial tears, internal disruption, herniation_** | **_Instability, lateral nerve entrapment_**                    |
| **_Phase 3: Stabilisation_** | **_Enlargement of articular processes_**                    | **_Disc resorption, osteophytes_**                  | **_One-level stenosis → multilevel spondylosis and stenosis_** |

The specific degenerative pathologies that narrow the canal include [8]:

- **_Intervertebral disc herniation_** (bulging, protrusion, extrusion, sequestration)
- **_Osteophytes_** (bony spurs from vertebral body endplates or uncovertebral joints)
- **_Facet joint hypertrophy_** (OA of facet joints → enlargement of articular processes)
- **_Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy_** (thickening and infolding, especially in extension)
- **_Spondylolisthesis_** (forward slip of one vertebra on another, most commonly degenerative at L4/5, or isthmic at L5/S1)

These processes cause **_disc degeneration → facet joint problems → lateral canal stenosis_** [9] in a stepwise fashion.

#### B. Ossification [4]

- **_OPLL — Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament_**:
  - **_Ectopic calcification as a cause of cord compression_** [4]
  - **_Much more common in Asian vs. non-Asian populations (up to 2–4%)_** [4]
  - **_Male predominance, affects younger population_** [4]
  - **_More commonly affects cervical than thoracic spine_** [4]
  - Pathophysiology: heterotopic bone formation within the PLL → progressive anterior compression of the cord
- **OLF — Ossification of Ligamentum Flavum**:
  - More common in the thoracic and thoracolumbar spine
  - Also more prevalent in East Asian populations
  - Causes posterior compression

#### C. Inflammatory [10]

- **_Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and the cervical spine_**:
  - **_High prevalence of cervical spine involvement_** [10]
  - **_Formation of retroodontoid pannus_** [10]
  - **_Synovial inflammation predisposes to cervical instability_** [10]
  - Three patterns: **_atlantoaxial subluxation (C1/2)_**, **_subaxial subluxation_**, **_vertical subluxation (basilar invagination)_** [10]
  - **_Use of RA medications reduces the incidence of cervical involvement_** [10]
- Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS): bamboo spine → rigid → fracture risk → cord compression
- Psoriatic arthritis

#### D. Infection (Important in HK)

- **Pott's disease** (spinal TB): formation of cold abscess and bony destruction → canal compromise
- **Epidural abscess**: rapidly expanding mass in the canal → emergency
- **Discitis/osteomyelitis**

#### E. Neoplastic

- **Metastases**: most commonly from paired organs — **_thyroid, breast, lung, kidney, prostate_** ("Lead Kettle" mnemonic: **L**ung, **K**idney, **T**hyroid, **B**reast, **P**rostate)
- Primary tumours: intradural (meningioma, schwannoma) or extradural

#### F. Traumatic

- Fractures: burst fracture fragments retropulsed into canal, compression fractures with kyphotic deformity
- **_Epidemiology of spinal cord injury — bimodal distribution_**: **_young adults (high-energy trauma)_** and **_old adults (low-energy trauma, osteoporotic bone, pre-existing spinal stenosis)_** [11]

#### G. Iatrogenic

- Post-surgical epidural haematoma
- Adjacent segment disease after fusion (accelerated degeneration at levels above/below a fused segment)

### 5.3 Pathological Causes of Canal and Foraminal Compression — Summary Diagram [12]

The lecture slide beautifully shows all the structures that can compress the cord/roots:

- **_Anteriorly: Osteophyte, ossification of PLL, spondylolisthesis, disc herniation_**
- **_Posteriorly: Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy/ossification, facet joint OA_**
- **_Result: Spinal cord compression_** from circumferential narrowing

## 6. Pathophysiology

### 6.1 The Static vs. Dynamic Model

Stenosis is not just about fixed narrowing. There are two components:

1. **Static factors**: Fixed anatomical narrowing (osteophytes, OPLL, facet hypertrophy, disc bulge at rest)
2. **Dynamic factors**: Narrowing that changes with posture and movement

The **dynamic component** is key to understanding why neurogenic claudication behaves the way it does:

- **_Extension decreases the size of the canal by ~11% and the foramina by ~15%_** [13]
- **_Flexion increases the size of the canal by ~11% and the foramina by ~12%_** [13]

**Why does extension narrow the canal?**

- The ligamentum flavum buckles/infolds into the canal during extension
- The facet joints telescope together, reducing foraminal height
- Disc bulging increases slightly posteriorly
- Any spondylolisthesis may worsen in extension

**Why does flexion open the canal?**

- The ligamentum flavum is stretched taut → flattens away from the canal
- The foramina open up as the facet joints separate
- The posterior elements spread apart

This explains the classic postural preference of lumbar stenosis patients: they lean forward on a shopping trolley, feel better sitting or bending, and worse standing upright or walking downhill.

**_Spinal stenosis can also occur by kinking centrally or compression by the superior articular process impingement at the neuroforamen_** — and this is **dynamic**, worsening in extension and improving in flexion [14].

### 6.2 Neural Compression Mechanisms

When neural structures are compressed:

1. **Mechanical compression** → direct axonal injury and demyelination
2. **Venous congestion** → impaired venous drainage of nerve roots → oedema → further compression (a vicious cycle)
3. **Arterial ischaemia** → nerve roots have limited collateral blood supply; compression of the radicular arteries → ischaemia → pain, paraesthesia, weakness
4. **Inflammatory mediators** → compressed nerve roots and discs release inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, PGE2) → chemical radiculitis

### 6.3 Why Neurogenic Claudication Occurs

The pathophysiology of neurogenic claudication is a combination of:

- Walking upright → spinal extension → canal narrows → mechanical compression of cauda equina
- Exercise → increased metabolic demand of nerve roots → but compromised arterial supply cannot meet demand → ischaemia
- Venous congestion → further exacerbated by walking → oedema

This is why symptoms are **progressive with walking** (increasing metabolic demand + increasing venous congestion) and **relieved by rest + flexion** (opens the canal, improves blood flow).

<Callout title="Why is it called 'neurogenic' claudication?" type="idea">
  "Claudication" comes from Latin *claudicare* = to limp. **Vascular**
  claudication is limping due to peripheral arterial disease. **Neurogenic**
  claudication is limping due to neural compression. Both cause exercise-induced
  leg symptoms, but the mechanism, aggravating/relieving factors, and
  examination findings are completely different.

## 7. Classification

### 7.3 By Level

| Level        | Key Points                                                                                                |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cervical** | → Myelopathy (cord compression) ± radiculopathy. Most common at **_C5/6 (most flexion & extension)_** [2] |
| **Thoracic** | Rare. Can cause thoracic myelopathy. Consider OLF, OPLL, metastases                                       |
| **Lumbar**   | → Neurogenic claudication ± radiculopathy ± cauda equina syndrome. Most common at L4/5                    |

### 7.4 Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) Score — Cervical Myelopathy [2]

This is the standard classification/grading system for cervical myelopathy severity:

| Section | Domain                                                | Maximum Score    |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **I**   | **_Upper extremity function_** (chopsticks/spoon use) | 4                |
| **II**  | **_Lower extremity function_** (walking ability)      | 4                |
| **III** | **_Sensory_** (UE, LE, trunk)                         | 6 (2 per region) |
| **IV**  | **_Bladder function_**                                | 3                |
|         | **_Total normal score_**                              | **_17 points_**  |

Lower scores indicate more severe myelopathy. The **recovery rate** after surgery is calculated as:

> Recovery rate = (postop JOA − preop JOA) / (17 − preop JOA) × 100%

### 7.5 Severity Classification of Lumbar Stenosis (Imaging-Based)

**Schizas Classification** (MRI-based, cross-sectional area of thecal sac):

- Grade A: Clearly visible CSF, rootlets not clumped
- Grade B: Rootlets occupy most of the dural sac but CSF still visible
- Grade C: No rootlets visible, appears as homogeneous grey signal
- Grade D: No posterior epidural fat, complete obliteration

## 8. Clinical Features

The clinical presentation depends on the **level** (cervical vs. lumbar) and the **structure compressed** (cord vs. roots vs. cauda equina).

| Symptom                                          | Pathophysiological Basis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Back pain_** [1]                              | Degenerative changes in discs, facets, and ligaments → mechanical nociceptive pain. Also contributed by inflammatory mediators from degenerative tissue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **_Back pain radiating to buttock and leg_** [2] | Compression/irritation of nerve roots within the narrowed canal or foramina → referred and radicular pain along the dermatomal distribution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **_Neurogenic claudication_** [1]                | The **hallmark symptom**. **_Walking increases severity of burning/aching pain, numbness, paraesthesia, or subjective weakness_** [1]. Mechanism: standing/walking → spinal extension → canal narrows (11%) + foramina narrow (15%) → compression of cauda equina → ischaemia of nerve roots at increased metabolic demand. **_Leg and/or back pain_** that is **_relieved with rest and flexion (sitting, bending forward)_** [13]. Patients characteristically adopt a flexed posture — the "shopping trolley sign" |
| Paraesthesia / Numbness                          | Compression of sensory fibres within the nerve roots → demyelination and ischaemia → abnormal sensory signalling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **_Subjective weakness_** in legs [1]            | Compression of motor fibres → impaired conduction → perceived leg heaviness or giving way, especially with walking                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **_Bladder disturbance_** [2]                    | Compression of sacral nerve roots (S2–S4) → autonomic dysfunction → initially difficulty initiating micturition, later retention with overflow incontinence (if severe / cauda equina syndrome)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

**The characteristic pattern of neurogenic claudication:**

- **_Pain worse with extension_** [13] (standing upright, walking downhill, lying prone)
- **_Pain improves with rest and flexion_** [13] (sitting, bending forward, walking uphill, cycling)
- **_"Park bench to park bench"_** — patients walk until symptoms become unbearable, then sit on a bench until symptoms resolve, then walk to the next bench [2]

#### Neurogenic vs. Vascular Claudication — A Critical Comparison [2][15]

| Feature             | **_Vascular Claudication_**                               | **_Neurogenic Claudication_**                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cause               | Chronic limb ischaemia (PAD)                              | Spinal stenosis                                                           |
| Radiation of pain   | **_From distal to proximal_**                             | **_From proximal to distal_**                                             |
| Exacerbating factor | **_Walking uphill_** (increased muscle demand), exercise  | **_Walking downhill_** (increased lordosis → extension → canal narrowing) |
| Relieving factor    | **_Rest ("shop window to shop window")_**                 | **_Bending over, sitting ("park bench to park bench")_**                  |
| Pulse               | **_Absent_** (peripheral pulses)                          | **_Present_**                                                             |
| Walking distance    | Fixed, reproducible distance                              | Variable                                                                  |
| Cycling             | Provokes symptoms (exercise)                              | Does NOT provoke symptoms (flexed posture)                                |
| Associations        | **_Atherosclerotic risk factors, atrophic skin changes_** | **_Only 10% SLR positive, back pain_** [15]                               |

<Callout title="Why does walking downhill worsen neurogenic claudication but walking uphill worsens vascular claudication?">
  Walking **downhill** requires you to lean back (extend the spine) → narrows
  the canal → worse neural compression. Walking **uphill** requires you to lean
  forward (flex the spine) → opens the canal → better for stenosis patients. But
  uphill walking demands more muscle work → more oxygen demand → worse for
  ischaemic legs (PAD). This is a favourite exam question!

#### Signs

| Sign                                               | Pathophysiological Basis                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| May have **relatively normal examination at rest** | Stenosis is often dynamic — at rest, in a flexed sitting position, the canal is more open. Signs may only become apparent after provocative exercise (ask the patient to walk until symptoms develop, then re-examine) |
| Reduced lumbar lordosis / flat back                | Patients adopt flexed posture to open the canal — chronic postural adaptation                                                                                                                                          |
| **_Motor deficit_** [1]                            | LMN weakness in the distribution of affected nerve roots (e.g., L5 → extensor hallucis longus weakness, S1 → ankle plantarflexion weakness)                                                                            |
| **_Sensory disturbance_** [1]                      | Dermatomal sensory loss corresponding to affected roots                                                                                                                                                                |
| **_Reflex alterations_** [1]                       | Diminished or absent reflexes at the level of the affected root (e.g., L4 → reduced knee jerk, S1 → reduced ankle jerk)                                                                                                |
| Positive **stoop test**                            | Patient walks until symptoms develop; stooping (bending forward) relieves them — confirms neurogenic claudication                                                                                                      |
| SLR (Straight Leg Raise)                           | **_Only ~10% positive_** [15] — this is because stenosis compresses roots more centrally; SLR mainly stretches roots in lateral/foraminal locations. A positive SLR suggests concomitant disc herniation               |
| Peripheral pulses **present**                      | Distinguishes from vascular claudication                                                                                                                                                                               |

#### Root-Specific Clinical Features [3]

| Root     | Pain / Sensory Distribution                                                                                                | Motor Weakness                                                                   | Reflex                                                 |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **_L4_** | **_Pain and sensory symptoms in anterior thigh_**                                                                          | Knee extension (quadriceps), hip adduction                                       | Reduced knee jerk                                      |
| **_L5_** | **_Pain radiates down posterior thigh, lateral calf, into great toe. Sensory symptoms affect lateral calf and great toe_** | Ankle dorsiflexion (tibialis anterior), great toe extension (EHL), hip abduction | None reliably (internal hamstring reflex — unreliable) |
| **_S1_** | **_Pain radiates down posterior leg into 4th and 5th toes. Sensory symptoms affect lateral calf, foot, and 4th/5th toes_** | Ankle plantarflexion (gastrocnemius/soleus), toe flexors, hip extension          | Reduced ankle jerk                                     |

**Remember the L4/5 stenosis case from the lecture** [16]: **_L4/5 stenosis with L4/5 spondylolisthesis_** can present with **_left anterior leg pain_** — this is because the **L4 root** exits at the L4/5 foramen and can be compressed by the spondylolisthesis causing anterior thigh pain (L4 dermatomal distribution).

#### Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) [1][2]

**_Severe stenosis_** can progress to cauda equina syndrome. This is an **orthopaedic emergency**.

Causes in the context of stenosis [1]:

- **_Large central disc herniation_**
- **_Chronic deterioration of spinal stenosis_**

Clinical features [1]:

- **_Acute low back pain_**
- **_Sciatica_** (often bilateral)
- **_Saddle paraesthesia_** (S2–S5 dermatomes — perineum, inner thighs, perianal)
- **_Lower limb weakness_**
- **_Gait dysfunction_**
- **_Sphincter incontinence_** (urinary retention → overflow, faecal incontinence)

<Callout title="Red Flag — Cauda Equina Syndrome" type="error">
  ***Always rule out cauda equina syndrome*** in any patient with lumbar
  stenosis [3]. Ask specifically about: - Urinary retention / incontinence -
  Faecal incontinence - Saddle anaesthesia - Bilateral leg weakness If any of
  these are present → **emergency MRI** and **surgical decompression within 48
  hours** [2].
</Callout>

### 8.2 Cervical Spinal Stenosis

Cervical stenosis causes **myelopathy** (cord compression) ± **radiculopathy** (root compression), depending on the location and severity.

#### Symptoms

| Symptom                                                   | Pathophysiological Basis                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Neck pain and stiffness_** [2]                         | Degenerative changes in discs and facet joints → mechanical pain. Loss of cervical lordosis → altered biomechanics                                                                        |
| **_Upper limb weakness and numbness_**                    | Compression of the spinal cord at the cervical level → corticospinal tract (motor) and spinothalamic/dorsal column (sensory) involvement. Cervical radiculopathy adds dermatomal symptoms |
| **_Lower limb weakness and numbness with UMN signs_** [2] | The corticospinal tracts for the legs travel medially in the cervical cord — central compression affects them. Results in spastic paraparesis                                             |
| Clumsiness in hands / loss of fine motor control          | Compression of the corticospinal tracts and dorsal columns → impaired proprioception and motor control → difficulty with buttons, writing, chopstick use                                  |
| **_Lhermitte's sign_** [2]                                | Electric shock-like sensation radiating down the spine/limbs on neck flexion. Mechanism: demyelinated dorsal columns are mechanically irritated by stretching during flexion              |
| Gait unsteadiness                                         | Posterior column (proprioception) + lateral corticospinal tract (motor) damage → sensory ataxia + spastic gait                                                                            |

#### Signs

**Neck Signs:**

- **_Loss of lordosis_** [2] — chronic muscular splinting and degenerative changes
- **_Lhermitte's sign_** — neck flexion produces electric shock down spine/limbs
- **_Reversed Lhermitte's sign_** [2] — same sensation on neck extension (suggests posterior compression, e.g., LF hypertrophy)
- Reduced range of motion

**Upper Limb (Myelopathic Hand Signs)** [2]:
These are **UMN** signs in the hands that indicate cervical cord compression:

| Sign                                  | Test                                                                                                   | Mechanism                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Inverted supinator reflex_**       | Tap brachioradialis → finger flexion instead of forearm supination                                     | Loss of supinator reflex arc (C5/6) + hyperactive finger flexors (C8) due to UMN disinhibition below the lesion   |
| **_Inverted biceps reflex_**          | Tap biceps tendon → finger flexion instead of elbow flexion                                            | Same principle — loss of biceps arc (C5/6) + hyperactive finger flexors                                           |
| **_Finger escape sign_**              | Ask patient to hold fingers extended and adducted → the ulnar fingers drift into abduction and flexion | Disruption of cortical hand control pathways → loss of fine motor inhibition → intrinsic muscle dysfunction       |
| **_10-second grip and release test_** | Ask patient to rapidly open and close fist for 10 seconds → < 20 cycles is abnormal                    | Impaired corticospinal tract conduction → reduced speed of hand movements                                         |
| **_Hoffmann sign_**                   | Flick the terminal phalanx of the middle finger → involuntary flexion of thumb and index finger        | UMN sign — hyperreflexia of finger flexors due to loss of cortical inhibition (analogous to Babinski in the foot) |

**Lower Limb Signs** [2]:

- **_Gait instability with positive Romberg test_** — dorsal column dysfunction → sensory ataxia (worse with eyes closed)
- **_Difficulty with toe-to-heel (tandem) walking_** — combined posterior column and corticospinal tract dysfunction
- Hyperreflexia (knee, ankle jerks)
- Clonus (sustained rhythmic involuntary muscular contractions)
- Upgoing plantars (Babinski sign) — UMN sign
- Spastic gait (circumduction, scissoring)

<Callout title="Mixed UMN and LMN Picture in Cervical Stenosis">
  At the **level** of compression, you get **LMN signs** (the anterior horn
  cells and nerve roots at that level are directly damaged → weakness, wasting,
  hyporeflexia in the myotome of that segment). **Below** the level of
  compression, you get **UMN signs** (the corticospinal tracts are interrupted →
  hyperreflexia, spasticity, upgoing plantars in the limbs below). This mixed
  picture is characteristic and helps localise the lesion. For example, C5/6
  stenosis → LMN signs at C5/6 (weak/wasted biceps, reduced biceps jerk) + UMN
  signs below (hyperreflexic triceps, finger flexors; spastic legs).

## 10. Key Anatomical and Pathological Correlations — Summary

### Prolapsed Intervertebral Disc (PID) — As a Cause of Stenosis [3]

**_Pathogenesis_**: Decreased aggrecan content in NP → more fibrous NP → cannot evenly distribute compressive forces → stress transferred to AF → AF tears (circumferential → radial) → NP protrudes through AF [3].

**_Pathology classification_** [3]:

1. **Bulging** — disc margin extends beyond vertebral body margin symmetrically
2. **Prolapse** (protrusion) — NP pushes through AF but AF still contains it
3. **Extrusion** — partial rupture of AF; NP extends beyond AF but remains connected
4. **Sequestration** — free fragment of NP separated from parent disc

**_Level of herniation_**: **_L5/S1 > L4/5 > L3/4_** [3]
**_Direction of herniation_**: **_posterolateral > central > lateral_** [3]

**_Nerve roots affected (using L4/5 as example)_** [3]:

- **_Posterolateral herniation → unilateral L5_** (traversing root)
- **_Central herniation → bilateral L5_** (or cauda equina if large)
- **_Lateral (far lateral/foraminal) herniation → unilateral L4_** (exiting root)

### Spondylolysis & Spondylolisthesis [3]

- **Spondylolysis** (lysis = dissolution/break): defect in the **pars interarticularis** with no movement of the vertebral body
- **Spondylolisthesis** (olisthesis = slipping): defect causing **forward slip** of one vertebra on another, **_most commonly L5/S1_** [3]
- This can contribute to stenosis through both the forward slip (narrowing the canal) and the associated facet/ligament hypertrophy

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Definition**: Abnormal narrowing of the spinal canal or IV foramina → neural compression. Most common in the lumbar spine.

**Epidemiology**: Most common cause of spinal surgery in over 65s. OPLL up to 2–4% in Asian populations. Male predominance.

**Risk Factors**: Ageing, male sex, smoking, heavy lifting, poor posture, congenitally narrow canal (short pedicles).

**Key Pathophysiology**:

- **Kirkaldy-Willis cascade**: Dysfunction → Instability → Stabilisation (= stenosis)
- **_Extension narrows the canal by 11% and foramina by 15%; flexion opens them by the same amount_** — this explains neurogenic claudication
- Neural compression causes ischaemia + venous congestion + mechanical injury + inflammation

**Clinical Features — Lumbar**:

- **Neurogenic claudication**: walking-induced pain/numbness/weakness in legs, relieved by flexion/sitting ("park bench to park bench"), worsened by extension/standing/walking downhill
- **Neurogenic vs. vascular claudication**: Neurogenic = proximal→distal pain, pulses present, worse downhill, better with flexion. Vascular = distal→proximal, pulses absent, worse uphill, better with rest only
- **Cauda equina syndrome**: bilateral sciatica, saddle anaesthesia, urinary retention, faecal incontinence — **surgical emergency**

**Clinical Features — Cervical**:

- **Myelopathy**: UMN signs (hyperreflexia, spasticity, Babinski, clonus) ± LMN signs at level of compression
- **Myelopathic hand signs**: Hoffmann's, finger escape, inverted reflexes, grip-and-release < 20/10s
- **JOA score**: Gold standard grading (total 17 points)

**Nerve Root Levels**: L4 = anterior thigh / knee jerk; L5 = lateral calf / great toe / EHL; S1 = posterior calf / lateral foot / ankle jerk

**Cervical vs. Lumbar Root Mismatch**: In the cervical spine, both central and foraminal discs at the same level affect the same root. In the lumbar spine, posterolateral disc affects the traversing root (one below), far lateral affects the exiting root (same level).
