## Complications of Spinal Stenosis

Complications of spinal stenosis can be divided into two broad categories: **complications of the disease itself** (what happens if stenosis is left untreated or progresses) and **complications of treatment** (both conservative and surgical). Both are high-yield and both need to be understood from first principles.

---

### A. Complications of the Disease (Natural History of Untreated/Progressive Stenosis)

Spinal stenosis is fundamentally a **progressive degenerative condition**. Left untreated, the Kirkaldy-Willis cascade continues: ***dysfunction → instability → stabilisation → one-level stenosis → multilevel spondylosis and stenosis*** [7]. The neural structures tolerate a certain degree of compression, but once a critical threshold is crossed, complications arise.

#### 1. Cauda Equina Syndrome (Lumbar Stenosis)

This is the **most feared complication** of lumbar spinal stenosis and the most important to rule out in every patient [1].

- Mechanism: ***Severe stenosis*** or ***large central disc herniation*** [1] → massive compression of the cauda equina nerve roots within the thecal sac → complete or near-complete conduction block
- Clinical features [1]:
  - ***Acute LBP***
  - ***Sciatica*** (often bilateral)
  - ***Saddle paraesthesia*** (S2–S5 dermatomes: perineum, inner thighs, perianal region)
  - ***LL weakness***
  - ***Gait dysfunction***
  - ***Sphincter incontinence*** — urinary retention with overflow incontinence, faecal incontinence
- Can occur via two pathways [1]:
  - ***Large central disc herniation*** — acute event, often dramatic onset
  - ***Chronic deterioration of spinal stenosis*** — insidious, progressive, may be precipitated by a minor event (e.g., a fall, sitting for a long flight)

> ***"Sphincter dysfunction — a point of no return"*** [38]. This is a critical teaching point from the neurosurgical lecture. Once bladder/bowel function is lost, recovery is poor even with decompressive surgery. This is why CES is a **surgical emergency** — every hour of delay reduces the chance of recovering sphincter function.

#### 2. Progressive Myelopathy (Cervical Stenosis)

- Mechanism: Ongoing compression of the cervical spinal cord → demyelination, axonal loss, ischaemia → progressive UMN dysfunction
- ***Chronic progressive / acute exacerbation*** [38a] — cervical myelopathy typically follows a stepwise or slowly progressive course, but can suddenly worsen after minor trauma (e.g., a fall, whiplash)
- Consequences: Progressive hand clumsiness → difficulty walking → wheelchair dependence → bladder dysfunction
- ***The spinal cord is very unforgiving*** [38] — unlike peripheral nerves, central nervous system neurons do not regenerate effectively. Once myelomalacia (T2 signal change in cord) develops, it represents **irreversible** damage
- ***Complete injury — prognosis is generally poor. Incomplete injury — prognosis highly variable*** [38]

#### 3. Central Cord Syndrome (Cervical Stenosis + Trauma)

This is a particularly important clinical scenario highlighted in the lectures:

- ***Old man with degenerated spine after a fall → central cord syndrome*** [38a]
- Mechanism: A patient with ***pre-existing spinal stenosis*** [11] has a constitutionally or degeneratively narrowed canal. Even a **low-energy** hyperextension injury (e.g., a simple fall in an elderly person) can cause the cord to be pinched between the anterior osteophytes/disc and the posterior buckling ligamentum flavum → cord contusion, predominantly affecting the **central** part of the cord
- Why central? The corticospinal tracts are somatotopically organised with **upper limb fibres medially** (centrally) and **lower limb fibres laterally**. Central cord injury therefore preferentially affects the arms more than the legs
- Clinical pattern: Upper limb weakness > lower limb weakness ("cape-like" motor loss), variable sensory loss, bladder dysfunction
- ***Epidemiology of spinal cord injury — bimodal distribution: young adults (high-energy trauma), old adults (low-energy trauma, osteoporotic bone, pre-existing spinal stenosis)*** [11]

<Callout title="Why Pre-Existing Stenosis Is a Risk Factor for Spinal Cord Injury" type="error">
This is a critical exam concept. An elderly patient with a narrow canal from degenerative stenosis has **no buffer zone** — the CSF space that normally cushions the cord is already obliterated. A trivial fall that would be harmless in someone with a normal canal can cause devastating cord injury. This is why the lecture specifically lists ***pre-existing spinal stenosis*** [11] as a risk factor for spinal cord injury in older adults.

#### 4. Progressive Neurological Deficit (Both Cervical and Lumbar)

- **Radiculopathy progression**: Ongoing nerve root compression → Wallerian degeneration of the axon → muscle denervation → irreversible wasting and weakness. Initially, nerve root compression causes demyelination (which is reversible with decompression), but prolonged compression leads to axonal loss (which is not)
- **Foot drop** (L5 radiculopathy): If L5 root compression from stenosis is left untreated → progressive weakness of tibialis anterior and EHL → inability to dorsiflex the foot → tripping, falls
- **Chronic pain syndrome**: Prolonged neural compression → central sensitisation in the dorsal horn → neuropathic pain that persists even after the structural problem is addressed

#### 5. Functional Decline and Deconditioning

- Progressive reduction in walking distance → reduced mobility → cardiovascular deconditioning, muscle atrophy, weight gain, social isolation, depression
- This creates a vicious cycle: less exercise → weaker paraspinal muscles → less dynamic stabilisation → more load on degenerative structures → worse symptoms → even less exercise
- Falls risk increases — especially in cervical myelopathy with gait disturbance and proprioceptive loss

#### 6. Bladder Dysfunction

- ***Bladder disturbance*** [2] — compression of sacral nerve roots (S2–S4) controlling the detrusor muscle and external urethral sphincter
- Initially: urgency, frequency (irritative symptoms from partial denervation)
- Late: urinary retention with overflow incontinence (detrusor failure) → secondary UTIs, hydronephrosis, renal impairment if chronic
- ***Long-term issues with neurogenic bladder*** [38]

---

### B. Complications of Surgical Treatment

Surgical complications are especially important to know because they form part of the **informed consent** discussion and are frequently examined.

#### 1. Complications of Cervical Spine Surgery

The lecture slide [39] provides an explicit list for counselling patients:

##### ***Anterior surgery complications*** [39]:

| Complication | Mechanism / Explanation |
|---|---|
| ***Oesophageal injury (intra-op or late due to implant)*** [39] | The anterior cervical approach requires retraction of the oesophagus and trachea to the opposite side to access the vertebral bodies. Excessive retraction can cause direct injury, or late perforation can occur from implant migration/erosion. Presents with dysphagia, fever, mediastinitis (late). Rare but devastating |
| ***Vertebral artery injury*** [39] | The vertebral arteries run through the transverse foramina of C1–C6. Lateral dissection or drilling too far laterally during corpectomy/discectomy can lacerate the artery → massive haemorrhage, posterior circulation stroke. Highest risk at C3–C6 and when anatomy is distorted by osteophytes |
| ***Airway compromise*** [39] | Post-operative retropharyngeal haematoma or soft tissue swelling can compress the airway → stridor, respiratory distress. Risk increases with multi-level surgery, longer operative time, and revision procedures. This is a **surgical emergency** — may require urgent intubation or tracheostomy |
| ***Pseudoarthrosis (failed fusion)*** [39] | After ACDF, the bone graft or cage must fuse with the adjacent vertebrae. If fusion fails → persistent motion at the operated segment → ongoing pain, hardware loosening or failure. Smoking is the strongest modifiable risk factor for pseudoarthrosis (nicotine inhibits osteoblast activity and reduces bone blood supply) |
| ***Adjacent level degeneration*** [39] | After fusion, the fused segment is rigid → the levels above and below must compensate with increased motion → accelerated degenerative changes at adjacent segments → new stenosis/disc herniation at a different level → may require further surgery. This is the most important **long-term** complication of spinal fusion |

##### ***Posterior surgery complications*** [39]:

| Complication | Mechanism / Explanation |
|---|---|
| ***Post-operative kyphosis*** [39] | Posterior surgery (especially laminectomy without fusion) disrupts the posterior tension band (laminae, spinous processes, supraspinous/interspinous ligaments, ligamentum flavum, paraspinal muscles). Loss of this posterior restraint → progressive forward angulation of the cervical spine → kyphotic deformity → the cord drapes over the vertebral bodies anteriorly → myelopathy recurs from a different mechanism. This is why **cervical laminectomy without fusion** is generally avoided in patients at risk of kyphosis |
| ***Axial symptoms (shoulder and neck pain)*** [39] | Posterior approach requires extensive paraspinal muscle dissection and detachment from the spinous processes → muscle denervation, atrophy, and chronic pain. ***Laminoplasty patients may experience more post-op axial neck pain*** [36] — the hinged laminae heal in an expanded position but the muscle disruption contributes to chronic axial symptoms in up to 30–40% of patients |
| ***C5 nerve root paresis*** [39] | A unique and somewhat mysterious complication seen after both laminoplasty and laminectomy. The C5 root has the shortest intradural course of the cervical roots → when the cord drifts posteriorly after posterior decompression, the C5 root is stretched like a guitar string over the remaining anterior structures → traction palsy → deltoid weakness (C5 myotome). Typically presents 1–14 days post-op. Most recover over weeks to months but some have persistent weakness |

#### 2. Complications of Lumbar Spine Surgery

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Dural tear / CSF leak** | The dura is thin and adherent to surrounding structures, especially in revision surgery or severe stenosis. Inadvertent durotomy during laminectomy → CSF leak → postural headache, wound leak, risk of meningitis. Repaired with primary suture ± fibrin sealant ± lumbar drain |
| **Nerve root injury** | Direct injury during root retraction, thermal injury from electrocautery, or compression from haematoma. Presents as new or worsened radiculopathy post-operatively |
| **Epidural haematoma** | Post-operative bleeding into the epidural space → mass effect on cauda equina or cord → acute neurological deterioration. Risk increased with anticoagulation, coagulopathy. Emergency surgical evacuation required |
| **Surgical site infection** | Superficial (wound) or deep (discitis, epidural abscess). Risk factors: diabetes, obesity, smoking, immunosuppression, prolonged surgery. Deep infection may require return to theatre for debridement + IV antibiotics |
| **Recurrent stenosis / recurrent disc herniation** | Scar tissue formation (epidural fibrosis) → re-narrowing of the canal. Recurrent disc herniation at the same level (5–15% after microdiscectomy). Distinguished from scar tissue on gadolinium-enhanced MRI (scar enhances, disc does not) |
| **Post-laminectomy instability** | Excessive removal of posterior elements → loss of structural support → segmental instability → progressive spondylolisthesis → recurrent stenosis. This is why fusion is added when decompression is extensive or spondylolisthesis coexists [3] |
| **Adjacent segment disease** | Same concept as cervical: fusion at one level → increased stress at adjacent levels → accelerated degeneration → new stenosis. Particularly relevant in patients with ***developmental stenosis: reoperation in 13% of patients, 50% at adjacent levels, 3.3% per year*** [5] |
| **Failed back surgery syndrome** | Persistent or recurrent pain after spinal surgery despite technically adequate decompression. Multifactorial: epidural fibrosis, foraminal stenosis missed at surgery, sacroiliac joint pain, myofascial pain, central sensitisation, psychosocial factors |

#### 3. Complications of Conservative Management

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **NSAID gastropathy** | COX-1 inhibition → reduced protective prostaglandin production in the gastric mucosa → erosions, ulcers, GI bleeding. Particular risk in elderly patients who are the main stenosis population. Mitigate with PPI co-prescription |
| **NSAID nephrotoxicity** | Prostaglandins maintain afferent arteriolar vasodilation; NSAIDs reduce renal perfusion → AKI. Risk in elderly, CKD, dehydration, concurrent ACEi/ARB use |
| **Steroid complications** (if prolonged oral steroids or repeated injections) | Osteoporosis (accelerates the degenerative process), hyperglycaemia (problematic in diabetics), adrenal suppression, immunosuppression, avascular necrosis |
| **Epidural steroid injection complications** | Rare: infection (epidural abscess), bleeding (epidural haematoma — risk with anticoagulants), dural puncture → headache, transient worsening of radiculopathy, very rare spinal cord infarction |
| **Progression of disease** | Conservative management treats symptoms but does not halt the underlying degenerative process. Stenosis may progress, and delayed surgery may be less effective if irreversible neural damage has occurred (myelomalacia in cervical, denervation atrophy in lumbar) |

### C. Complications of Spinal Cord Injury (When Stenosis Leads to SCI)

If spinal stenosis culminates in spinal cord injury (e.g., central cord syndrome after a fall, or progressive myelopathy), the **systemic complications of SCI** are extensive. The lecture slide [40] provides a comprehensive organ-system-based table:

| Organ System | ***Complications*** [40] | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| **Cardiovascular** | ***Bradycardia/dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic pulmonary oedema*** [40] | Loss of sympathetic outflow (T1–L2) with unopposed vagal tone → bradycardia. Fluid overload + neurogenic cardiac stunning → pulmonary oedema |
| **Pulmonary** | ***Hypoventilation/respiratory failure, poor secretion control, ARDS, aspiration, pneumonia*** [40] | Cervical SCI → diaphragm (C3–5) and intercostal muscle (T1–T12) weakness → reduced tidal volume, ineffective cough → secretion retention → atelectasis → pneumonia. Pneumonia is the **leading cause of death** in chronic SCI |
| **Gastrointestinal** | ***Gastric dysmotility, adynamic ileus, gastritis and ulceration, pancreatitis*** [40] | Loss of autonomic regulation → GI stasis. Stress response + steroid use → Cushing's ulcers. Paralytic ileus common in acute phase |
| **Haematologic** | ***Venous thromboembolism*** [40] | Immobility + loss of muscle pump in paralysed limbs → venous stasis → DVT → PE. PE is a major cause of mortality in SCI. Prophylaxis: LMWH, compression stockings, early mobilisation |
| **Neurologic** | ***Neurogenic shock, depression, PTSD, anxiety, autonomic dysreflexia*** [40] | Neurogenic shock (distinct from spinal shock): loss of sympathetic vasomotor tone → vasodilation → hypotension with bradycardia. Autonomic dysreflexia (in injuries above T6): noxious stimulus below injury level → massive unregulated sympathetic response → hypertensive crisis, bradycardia, headache, flushing. ***Long-term issues with dysreflexia, spasticity, contracture*** [38] |
| **Genitourinary** | ***Bladder dysfunction, UTI, priapism*** [40] | ***Long-term issues with neurogenic bladder*** [38]. Loss of voluntary bladder control → retention → intermittent catheterisation required → recurrent UTIs → potential long-term renal damage. Priapism indicates sacral parasympathetic disruption (S2–4) |
| **Integument** | ***Pressure ulceration*** [40] | Loss of sensation + immobility → prolonged pressure on bony prominences (sacrum, ischial tuberosities, heels, occiput) → tissue ischaemia → skin breakdown. ***Long-term issues with skin problems*** [38]. Prevention: regular repositioning, pressure-relieving mattresses, skin inspection |

<Callout title="Key Conclusions from the Lectures on Spinal Cord Complications" type="error">

The neurosurgical lecture concludes with critical teaching points [38]:

- ***The spinal cord is very unforgiving***
- ***Acute paraplegia is an EMERGENCY***
- ***Sphincter dysfunction — a point of no return***
- ***Early detection and investigation***
- ***Complete injury — prognosis is generally poor***
- ***Incomplete injury — prognosis highly variable***
- ***Long-term issues with dysreflexia, neurogenic bladder, spasticity, contracture, and skin problems***

These are the phrases you must know for exams. They encapsulate the urgency and gravity of spinal cord disease.

| Category | Key Complications | Key Teaching Point |
|---|---|---|
| **Disease progression (lumbar)** | CES, progressive radiculopathy, chronic pain, deconditioning | CES is the most important — always screen for red flags |
| **Disease progression (cervical)** | Progressive myelopathy, central cord syndrome after minor trauma, irreversible cord damage | Pre-existing stenosis + minor trauma can cause devastating SCI |
| **Anterior cervical surgery** | ***Oesophageal injury, vertebral artery injury, airway compromise, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent level degeneration*** [39] | Adjacent level degeneration is the most important long-term issue |

      question: "An elderly man with known cervical spondylotic myelopathy falls at home and develops acute upper limb weakness greater than lower limb weakness. What is the diagnosis, and why does this pattern occur?",
      markscheme: "Central cord syndrome. Pre-existing stenosis means the canal is already narrowed. A low-energy hyperextension fall pinches the cord between anterior osteophytes and posteriorly buckling ligamentum flavum. Upper limbs are affected more than lower limbs because the corticospinal tracts are somatotopically arranged with upper limb fibres located centrally (medially) and lower limb fibres peripherally (laterally). Central contusion therefore preferentially damages upper limb tracts."

After posterior decompression (laminoplasty or laminectomy), the cord drifts posteriorly away from the anterior compression. This stretches the C5 root like a guitar string over the remaining anterior structures, causing a traction palsy. Presents as deltoid weakness (C5 myotome) typically 1-14 days post-op.

    {
      question: "Why is adjacent segment disease the most important long-term complication of spinal fusion, and which patient group is at highest risk?",
      markscheme: "After fusion, the operated segment is rigid and cannot contribute to spinal motion. The levels above and below must compensate with increased motion and stress, accelerating degenerative changes (disc degeneration, facet OA, stenosis). This may require further surgery at a new level. Patients with developmental stenosis (short pedicles) are at highest risk because their entire canal is constitutionally narrow: reoperation rate is 13% of patients, 50% at adjacent levels, approximately 3.3% patients per year."
    },
    {
      question: "Name 4 organ-system complications of spinal cord injury from the lecture and explain the pathophysiology of ONE.",
      markscheme: "Cardiovascular (bradycardia/dysrhythmia), pulmonary (pneumonia, respiratory failure), haematologic (VTE), genitourinary (neurogenic bladder, UTI), neurologic (autonomic dysreflexia), integument (pressure ulceration). Example pathophysiology of VTE: loss of muscle pump function in paralysed limbs causes venous stasis. Combined with immobility and possible endothelial injury, this fulfils Virchow triad, leading to DVT and risk of PE. PE is a major cause of mortality in SCI."
    },
    {
      question: "The lecture states 'sphincter dysfunction is a point of no return.' Explain what this means and its clinical implication.",
      markscheme: "Once bladder and bowel sphincter function is lost due to cauda equina compression (sacral nerve roots S2-S4), recovery is very poor even after surgical decompression. The sacral nerve roots controlling the detrusor muscle and external sphincter undergo irreversible axonal damage if compression is prolonged. Clinical implication: cauda equina syndrome with sphincter involvement is a surgical emergency requiring decompression within 48 hours. Any delay further reduces the already slim chance of sphincter recovery."
