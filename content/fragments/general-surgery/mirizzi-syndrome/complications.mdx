## Complications of Mirizzi Syndrome

Complications of Mirizzi syndrome can be organised into three categories:

1. **Complications of the disease itself** (from the pathological process of stone impaction, CHD compression, and chronic inflammation)
2. **Complications of associated conditions** (from concurrent cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis)
3. **Complications of treatment** (from ERCP and from surgery)

Understanding *why* each complication occurs — tracing it back to the underlying pathophysiology — is far more useful than memorising a list.

---

### A. Complications of the Disease Process

These arise directly from the stone impaction, chronic inflammation, and biliary obstruction that define Mirizzi syndrome.

#### 1. Cholecystobiliary Fistula (Csendes Types II–IV)

- **Mechanism**: The impacted stone exerts chronic pressure on the adjacent bile duct wall. Combined with inflammation-mediated ischaemia and pressure necrosis, the stone erodes through the gallbladder/cystic duct wall *and* the CHD/CBD wall, creating an abnormal communication [1][2]
- **Why it matters**: This is not just a complication — it *defines* the progression of Mirizzi syndrome from Type I (compression only) to Types II–IV. The fistula fundamentally changes the surgical approach: primary repair vs. bilioenteric anastomosis. The larger the fistula, the more complex the surgery.
- **Consequence**: Once a fistula exists, stones can migrate from the gallbladder into the CBD (causing secondary choledocholithiasis), and the structural integrity of the bile duct is compromised

#### 2. ***Gallbladder Carcinoma (CA Gallbladder)***

- **Mechanism**: ***Recurrent inflammation and biliary stasis may predispose to both conditions*** [1]. The chronic inflammatory milieu — repeated cycles of mucosal injury, regeneration, and fibrosis — drives a **dysplasia-carcinoma sequence** (analogous to Barrett's → oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or UC → colorectal cancer). Chronic inflammation generates reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and promotes proliferative signalling.
- ***CA gallbladder*** is a recognized complication/association of Mirizzi syndrome [2]. Reported coexistence rate: **5–28%** across various surgical series.
- **Why it matters**: This is the reason you must always perform **CT abdomen + contrast** preoperatively (to look for ***enlarged porta hepatis LNs or hepatic infiltration of metastasis*** [1]) and why **MRCP** is important (***T2-weighted images can differentiate between a neoplastic and inflammatory mass*** [1]). Intraoperative frozen section of the gallbladder specimen should always be sent.

<Callout title="CA Gallbladder in Mirizzi" type="error">
Never assume an inflammatory mass at the GB neck is "just" Mirizzi syndrome. With a 5–28% coexistence rate of gallbladder carcinoma, you must actively exclude malignancy in every single case. If frozen section returns positive for malignancy, the surgical plan changes completely — you need an oncological resection (extended cholecystectomy with hepatic segments IVb/V resection + lymphadenectomy) rather than simple fistula repair [2].
</Callout>

#### 3. Choledocholithiasis (Secondary CBD Stones)

- **Mechanism**: Once a cholecystobiliary fistula forms (Types II–IV), gallstones can migrate from the gallbladder through the fistula directly into the CBD. Additionally, bile stasis proximal to the obstruction promotes *de novo* stone formation within the bile ducts.
- **Why it matters**: This is why ***ECBD should be performed in all patients with cholecystobiliary fistula to rule out concomitant choledocholithiasis (CBD stones) unless it has been performed endoscopically*** [1]. Missed CBD stones after Mirizzi surgery will cause recurrent cholangitis and obstructive jaundice.

#### 4. Cholecystoenteric Fistula and Gallstone Ileus (Csendes Type V)

- **Mechanism**: The same chronic inflammatory and erosive process that creates a cholecystobiliary fistula can also erode through the gallbladder wall into adjacent bowel — most commonly the duodenum (***cholecystoduodenal fistula, MC*** [2])
- Once the fistula exists, a large gallstone can pass from the gallbladder through the fistula into the bowel lumen. If the stone is large enough ( > 2–2.5 cm), it impacts at the narrowest part of the small bowel — the ***terminal ileum, 2 feet proximal to the ileocaecal valve*** [2] — causing mechanical small bowel obstruction: **gallstone ileus**
- ***Bouveret's syndrome***: stone stuck at the duodenum/stomach, causing gastric outlet obstruction [2]
- **Imaging findings**: ***Rigler's triad on AXR: pneumobilia + SBO + ectopic gallstone*** [2]
  - ***Pneumobilia*** (air in the biliary tree) occurs because the cholecystoenteric fistula allows bowel gas to reflux into the biliary system
- **Management**: ***Enterolithotomy to relieve SBO*** — ***proximal enterotomy (NOT over the stone because of ulceration)*** → ***milk the stone proximally for extraction*** → same-session or elective cholecystectomy + fistula repair [2]

<Callout title="Gallstone Ileus — A Surgical Emergency">
Gallstone ileus (Csendes Type 5B) is one of the few complications of Mirizzi syndrome that presents as an **acute surgical emergency** with complete bowel obstruction. Immediate priorities are bowel decompression and relief of the obstruction by enterolithotomy. Definitive biliary surgery can be addressed at the same sitting or electively [2].
</Callout>

#### 5. Acute Cholangitis and Biliary Sepsis

- **Mechanism**: CHD obstruction → bile stasis → bacterial colonisation of stagnant bile → ascending infection. Common organisms: *E. coli, Klebsiella*, anaerobes. The liver's Kupffer cells normally clear gut-derived endotoxins from the portal blood, but in biliary obstruction, this function is impaired → **endotoxaemia** [3].
- **Presentation**: Charcot's triad (fever + jaundice + RUQ pain) in ~50–70% of cholangitis cases. If untreated → **suppurative cholangitis** with Reynolds' pentad (Charcot's + hypotension + altered mental status) in < 10% — a life-threatening emergency [7]
- **Why it matters**: Cholangitis is the most common acute complication requiring emergency intervention (RAD: Resuscitate → Antibiotics → Drainage) [16]

#### 6. Acute Cholecystitis

- ***Up to 1/3 of patients with Mirizzi syndrome have acute cholecystitis on presentation*** [1]
- **Mechanism**: The same stone impaction at Hartmann's pouch that compresses the CHD also obstructs gallbladder outflow → bile stasis within the GB → chemical inflammation (first 48 hours) → secondary bacterial infection [6]
- Can progress to: ***gallbladder empyema*** (pus-filled GB), ***gangrenous cholecystitis*** (wall necrosis from ischaemia), ***perforation*** (necrotic wall ruptures → biliary peritonitis) [6]

#### 7. Acute Pancreatitis

- ***In rare cases, acute pancreatitis*** can complicate Mirizzi syndrome [1]
- **Mechanism**: If the stone at Hartmann's pouch is large enough or positioned low enough, or if smaller stones migrate distally, they can obstruct the ampulla of Vater or pancreatic duct → impaired pancreatic enzyme drainage → premature intra-acinar enzyme activation → autodigestion → acute pancreatitis
- This is the same mechanism as gallstone pancreatitis from choledocholithiasis

#### 8. Hepatic Abscess

- **Mechanism**: Prolonged biliary obstruction + cholangitis → ascending infection into intrahepatic ducts → suppuration → hepatic abscess formation [24]. This is more likely with delayed diagnosis or inadequate drainage.
- Listed as a complication of gallstones perforating to the liver [24]

#### 9. Secondary Biliary Cirrhosis

- **Mechanism**: Long-standing, unrelieved biliary obstruction → chronic cholestasis → periductal fibrosis → progressive hepatic fibrosis → **biliary cirrhosis**. This is a rare long-term complication seen in delayed or missed diagnosis.

### B. Systemic Complications of Prolonged Biliary Obstruction

These are the consequences of obstructive jaundice itself, applicable to any cause of obstruction but directly relevant to Mirizzi syndrome. They are also the reasons why preoperative optimisation is critical [3].

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bleeding tendency*** [3] | Obstructive jaundice → no bile salts in gut → ***impaired absorption of fat-soluble vitamin K*** → ↓ hepatic synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, X → coagulopathy | Must correct with Vitamin K IV before any invasive procedure; check PT/INR |
| ***Infection / biliary sepsis*** [3] | ***Endotoxaemia when liver is unable to defend against gut endotoxins*** + ***impaired reticuloendothelial function*** + ***impaired cell-mediated immunity*** [3] | Broad-spectrum antibiotics mandatory; these patients are immunocompromised by their obstruction |
| ***Poor wound healing / poor anastomotic healing*** [3] | ***Impaired protein synthesis*** → hypoalbuminaemia → poor tissue repair + impaired collagen cross-linking | Nutritional optimisation preoperatively; higher risk of anastomotic leak/stricture |
| **Renal impairment** | Cholestasis → endotoxin-mediated renal vasoconstriction + systemic vasodilatation → hepatorenal physiology | Aggressive IV hydration; avoid nephrotoxins; monitor UO |

---

### C. Complications of Treatment

#### C1. Complications of ERCP

ERCP is used for preoperative biliary decompression (stenting) and fistula assessment. It carries a recognised complication profile [23][17]:

| Complication | Incidence | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Post-ERCP pancreatitis*** [23] | ~2% (***MOST frequent complication*** [23]) | Manipulation of the pancreatic orifice during cannulation → pancreatic duct oedema → impaired drainage → enzyme activation → pancreatitis | Supportive: NPO, IV fluids, analgesia. Prevent: pancreatic duct stent, guidewire cannulation |
| **Cholangitis** [23] | ~0.6% | Manipulation of an obstructed biliary system → introduction of bacteria / failure to achieve complete drainage | IV antibiotics; repeat drainage if stent is blocked |
| **Bleeding** [23][17] | ~2% post-sphincterotomy | ***Bleeding from papillotomy*** [17] — cutting the sphincter of Oddi severs submucosal vessels | Endoscopic haemostasis (injection, clipping). Prevent: correct coagulopathy pre-procedure |
| ***Perforation*** [23][17] | ~1% | Duodenal wall injury from scope manipulation; guidewire perforation of bile duct; sphincterotomy extending beyond the duodenal wall | If contained → conservative (NPO, antibiotics, NGT). If free → surgical repair |
| **Stent occlusion/migration** [23] | Late | Sludge/biofilm accumulation (plastic stents) or tumour ingrowth (metallic stents); stent displacement | Repeat ERCP for stent exchange |

#### C2. Complications of Surgery (Cholecystectomy ± Bile Duct Reconstruction)

Surgery for Mirizzi syndrome is inherently more complex and higher risk than routine cholecystectomy because of the dense inflammation, distorted anatomy, and potential need for bile duct reconstruction.

**Immediate (intraoperative)**:

| Complication | Mechanism in Mirizzi Context |
|---|---|
| ***Bile duct injury*** (most feared) | ***Dense adhesions and edematous inflammatory tissue cause distortion of normal anatomy and increase the risk of biliary injury*** [1]. The CHD, cystic duct, and cystic artery are fused in a mass of fibrosis. The surgeon may inadvertently clip, divide, or cauterise the CHD or right hepatic duct thinking it is the cystic duct. This is why the critical view of safety is essential — and why it is often unachievable in Mirizzi, necessitating conversion to open [1][2]. |
| ***Conversion to open surgery*** | Not truly a "complication" but a **safety measure**: ***5% in elective, 25% in emergency*** cholecystectomy [21]. In Mirizzi syndrome, conversion rates are much higher (30–60%) due to inability to safely identify structures. |
| **Vascular injury** (cystic artery, right hepatic artery) | The right hepatic artery may loop into the inflamed Calot's triangle as an anatomical variant. In the fibrotic, distorted field of Mirizzi surgery, it can be injured. Also risk of injury to the middle hepatic vein close to the GB fossa [21]. |
| ***Damage to neighbouring structures*** [21] | ***Bile leakage (biliary tree), bleeding (cystic artery), pneumoperitoneum from injury to duodenum, transverse colon, hepatic flexure*** [21] |

**Early (postoperative, days to weeks)**:

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Biliary leakage*** [21] | From cystic duct stump, fistula repair site, or duct of Luschka. Incidence ~0.5% in standard cholecystectomy but higher in Mirizzi surgery due to complex bile duct reconstruction [21]. Delayed presentation (post-op D2–10): ***fever, RUQ pain, deranged LFT*** [21] | ***USG/CT → HIDA scan/MRCP to confirm → ERCP stent (minor) or laparotomy + lavage + Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (major)*** [21] |
| **Post-operative jaundice** | Residual/missed CBD stones (dropped or migrated through fistula), oedema at repair/anastomosis site, inadvertent bile duct ligation | Check tube cholangiogram (if T-tube in situ); MRCP; ERCP for stone extraction |
| **Post-operative cholangitis** | Infected residual stone, stent occlusion, anastomotic stenosis | IV antibiotics + biliary drainage |
| **Wound infection** | Contaminated field (bile spillage during surgery); poor wound healing from obstructive jaundice [3] | Antibiotics; wound care |
| **Intra-abdominal collection / subphrenic abscess** | Inadequate lavage; bile leak; haematoma infection | ***Drainage + antibiotics*** [21] |

**Late (weeks to months to years)**:

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bile duct stricture*** [21] | Scarring at the fistula repair site, suture-line fibrosis, ischaemic injury during dissection. This is the ***most frequent long-term complication*** of biliary reconstruction. Presents with recurrent jaundice, cholangitis [25] | ***Reconstruction ± hepaticojejunostomy*** [21]; endoscopic balloon dilatation + stenting for accessible strictures |
| **Recurrent cholangitis** | Stricture formation → bile stasis → stone formation → infection (same pathological cycle as RPC). Also possible after cholecystectomy due to biliary stasis from ***ERCP-induced CBD dilatation or aging-related CBD dilatation*** [16] | Antibiotics; ERCP for stone clearance / stricture dilatation; revision surgery if recurrent |
| ***Post-cholecystectomy syndrome*** [21] | ***Persistent symptoms (e.g. biliary colic, diarrhoea) after operation*** [21]. May be due to residual stones, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, bile salt malabsorption, or unrecognised concurrent pathology | Investigate: MRCP, ERCP, manometry. Treat underlying cause |
| **Post-cholecystectomy choledocholithiasis** [21] | ***Bile stasis due to increased CBD calibre (loss of GB storing function)*** [21] — after GB removal, bile flows continuously into the CBD rather than being stored, potentially leading to CBD dilatation and stasis | ERCP stone clearance |
| **Anastomotic stricture** (after bilioenteric anastomosis) | Scarring at the hepaticojejunostomy/choledochojejunostomy site — the ***most frequent long-term complication of Roux-en-Y hepatojejunostomy is stenosis of biliary-enteric anastomosis leading to jaundice, cirrhosis or cholangitis*** [25] | Percutaneous or endoscopic dilatation; revision hepaticojejunostomy |

<Callout title="Bile Duct Injury — The Most Feared Complication" type="error">
Iatrogenic bile duct injury during cholecystectomy for Mirizzi syndrome is the single most feared surgical complication. The dense inflammation makes the anatomy unrecognisable. The conversion rate to open is high. If the CHD is transected, the repair is a major Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy — a life-altering operation with long-term stricture risk. This is why ***preoperative MRCP and ERCP are so important*** — they delineate the anatomy before the surgeon enters a hostile operative field, and they classify the Csendes type so the team can plan the appropriate reconstruction in advance [1][2].
