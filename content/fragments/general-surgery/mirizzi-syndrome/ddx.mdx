## Differential Diagnosis of Mirizzi Syndrome

### Conceptual Framework: Why is the DDx Challenging?

The fundamental difficulty with Mirizzi syndrome is that it presents as **obstructive jaundice ± cholangitis ± cholecystitis** — a constellation shared by many hepatobiliary conditions. The stone is *not* in the CBD (where you'd expect it in choledocholithiasis), but its effects *mimic* a CBD stone. Additionally, the pericholecystic inflammation can mimic a hilar mass (gallbladder carcinoma, Klatskin tumour). This is why Mirizzi syndrome is frequently diagnosed only intraoperatively [1].

The DDx can be approached systematically by:
1. **Level of biliary obstruction** (hilar vs. mid-CBD vs. distal CBD) [3]
2. **Mechanism of obstruction** (intraluminal vs. mural vs. extramural) [4]
3. **Clinical presentation pattern** (cholangitis-predominant vs. cholecystitis-predominant vs. painless jaundice)

---

### Approach 1: DDx by Level of Obstruction

Mirizzi syndrome causes obstruction at the **hilum / proximal CHD level** — the stone in Hartmann's pouch compresses the CHD just below the hepatic confluence. This means the DDx is primarily against other causes of **hilar-level** obstruction [1][3].

***Causes according to level of obstruction*** [3]:

| Level | Differential Diagnoses | Key Distinguishing Features from Mirizzi |
|---|---|---|
| ***Hilum*** (where Mirizzi acts) | ***CA Gallbladder***, ***HCC***, ***Klatskin's tumour*** (hilar cholangiocarcinoma), ***Mirizzi syndrome***, ***Porta lymphadenopathy***, ***Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)***, ***Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC)*** [3] | See individual entries below |
| ***Mid-CBD*** | ***CA CBD***, ***CA Head of pancreas***, ***Lymphadenopathy*** [3] | Stone in Mirizzi is at GB neck/cystic duct level, not mid-CBD; imaging shows stone at GB neck rather than within CBD lumen |
| ***Distal CBD*** | ***Bile duct strictures***, ***Periampullary carcinoma***, ***Choledochal cysts***, ***Pancreatic cysts***, ***Chronic pancreatitis*** [3] | Distal CBD obstruction shows different dilatation pattern (dilated CBD + CHD); Mirizzi shows normal-calibre CBD below obstruction |

---

### Approach 2: DDx by Mechanism of Obstruction

***Differential diagnosis of obstructive jaundice*** [4]:

| Mechanism | Conditions | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| ***Intraluminal*** | ***Choledocholithiasis***, ***Acute cholangitis***, ***RPC*** [4] | Stone is *inside* the CBD lumen, not compressing from outside |
| ***Mural*** | ***Cholangiocarcinoma***, ***PSC*** [4] | Pathology is in the bile duct wall itself (tumour or fibrosis) |
| ***Extramural*** | ***CA head of pancreas***, ***Lymphadenopathy***, ***Gallstone (Mirizzi syndrome)*** [4] | Mirizzi is classified as *extramural* — the stone is outside the bile duct compressing it |

<Callout title="Mirizzi is Extramural Obstruction">
This is a key conceptual point: even though Mirizzi syndrome is caused by a gallstone (which you'd normally associate with intraluminal obstruction), the stone is in the *cystic duct/Hartmann's pouch*, not inside the CBD. It compresses the CHD from outside — hence it is classified as **extramural** obstruction [4]. This is the same category as a pancreatic head mass compressing the CBD. Understanding this helps you see why imaging may not show a stone *within* the CBD.

### Approach 3: Individual Differential Diagnoses with Distinguishing Features

These are the key conditions listed in the senior notes that must be systematically differentiated from Mirizzi syndrome [1]:

#### 1. Choledocholithiasis (CBD Stones)

**The most important differential** — and the condition Mirizzi syndrome is most frequently confused with.

- **Mechanism**: Gallstone migrates from gallbladder through cystic duct and lodges *within* the CBD lumen [2][5]
- **Why it mimics Mirizzi**: Both cause obstructive jaundice, RUQ pain, and cholestatic LFTs. Both are stone-related. Both may present with Charcot's triad if complicated by cholangitis.
- **How to distinguish**:

| Feature | Choledocholithiasis | Mirizzi Syndrome |
|---|---|---|
| Stone location | *Within* CBD lumen | In Hartmann's pouch / cystic duct (*outside* CBD) |
| CBD calibre | **Dilated CBD** with stone visible within it on USG [5] | **Normal-calibre CBD** below the level of obstruction; dilatation is *above* GB neck level only [1] |
| USG finding | Dilated CBD ( > 8 mm) ± visible stone in CBD | Contracted/inflamed GB with stone at neck; dilated biliary system *above* GB neck with abrupt transition to normal CBD below [1] |
| ERCP finding | Stone within CBD lumen | Eccentric/excavating defect on *lateral wall* of CBD at level of cystic duct; ± contrast passing into GB via fistula [1] |
| Gallbladder | Usually contains stones but may not be inflamed | Typically contracted and inflamed, often with a large stone impacted at neck |

<Callout title="The Key USG Clue" type="idea">
The single most helpful USG finding that points to Mirizzi over choledocholithiasis is: **dilated intrahepatic ducts + stone at GB neck + normal-calibre CBD distal to the stone** [1]. In choledocholithiasis, the CBD itself is dilated and you may see the stone within it.
</Callout>

#### 2. Acute Cholecystitis

- **Mechanism**: Prolonged gallstone impaction at Hartmann's pouch/cystic duct → gallbladder distension → chemical then bacterial inflammation [6][7]
- **Why it mimics Mirizzi**: Both involve stone impaction at the same anatomical site (Hartmann's pouch/cystic duct). Both cause RUQ pain, fever, positive Murphy's sign. In fact, ***up to 1/3 of Mirizzi syndrome patients present with acute cholecystitis*** [1].
- **How to distinguish**:

| Feature | Acute Cholecystitis | Mirizzi Syndrome |
|---|---|---|
| Jaundice | Usually absent or mild (bilirubin only mildly elevated from pericholecystic inflammation) [8] | ***Prominent jaundice*** — because CHD is obstructed, not just cystic duct [1] |
| LFT | Usually **normal** or mildly abnormal [8] | Significantly **elevated ALP and bilirubin** (cholestatic pattern) [1] |
| Intrahepatic duct dilatation | Absent (obstruction limited to gallbladder outflow) | Present (CHD obstruction causes upstream dilatation) |
| CBD calibre | Normal | Normal *below* stone, but dilated CHD *above* |

> **Clinical pearl**: If you see a patient with what looks like acute cholecystitis but with *disproportionately significant jaundice and dilated intrahepatic ducts*, think Mirizzi syndrome. "Severe jaundice is suggestive of cholangitis, CBD obstruction or obstruction of the bile ducts by severe pericholecystic inflammation or ***Mirizzi syndrome***" [8].

#### 3. Gallbladder Carcinoma (CA Gallbladder)

- **Mechanism**: Malignant neoplasm of the gallbladder (90% adenocarcinoma), often arising in a background of chronic cholecystitis/cholelithiasis [9]
- **Why it mimics Mirizzi**: Both can present with obstructive jaundice at the hilar level [3]. Both are associated with gallstones. The inflammatory mass in Mirizzi can look exactly like a gallbladder tumour on imaging. ***Critically, Mirizzi syndrome itself is a risk factor for gallbladder carcinoma*** — the two can coexist [1][2].
- **How to distinguish**:

| Feature | CA Gallbladder | Mirizzi Syndrome |
|---|---|---|
| Jaundice character | ***Painless progressive obstructive jaundice*** (late stage) [4] | Painful jaundice with cholangitis/cholecystitis features |
| Constitutional symptoms | Weight loss, anorexia, cachexia (more prominent) | Less prominent unless concurrent malignancy |
| Imaging | ***CT: enhancing mass lesion, porta hepatis lymphadenopathy, liver infiltration (segments IV/V)*** [1][9] | ***MRCP: T2-weighted images can differentiate inflammatory from neoplastic mass*** [1]; CT shows no enhancing mass |
| Gallbladder wall | Irregular thickening or mass, loss of GB-liver interface | Diffuse thickening (inflammatory), preserved interface |
| Histology | Malignant cells on biopsy/frozen section | Inflammatory changes |

<Callout title="Always Rule Out CA Gallbladder" type="error">
***CT abdomen should be performed in all suspected Mirizzi syndrome to determine whether malignancy is present by demonstrating enlarged porta hepatis LNs or hepatic infiltration/metastasis*** [1]. This is non-negotiable. The 5–28% coexistence rate of gallbladder cancer with Mirizzi syndrome means you cannot assume it is "just" Mirizzi.
</Callout>

#### 4. Klatskin's Tumour (Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma)

- **Mechanism**: Cholangiocarcinoma (adenocarcinoma, > 90%) arising at the **confluence of the hepatic ducts** — "Klatskin" = perihilar cholangiocarcinoma [3][10]
- **Why it mimics Mirizzi**: Both cause hilar-level obstruction with intrahepatic duct dilatation. Both cause obstructive jaundice.
- **How to distinguish**:

| Feature | Klatskin's Tumour | Mirizzi Syndrome |
|---|---|---|
| Pain | Often ***painless*** progressive jaundice [4] | Typically *painful* (cholecystitis/cholangitis) |
| Gallstones | Usually absent | Present (the cause) |
| MRCP/ERCP | Stricture/occlusion at the hepatic duct confluence; no gallstone at GB neck | Stone at GB neck; extrinsic compression of CHD |
| CT | Enhancing hilar mass, biliary dilatation *above* confluence, vascular encasement | Inflammatory changes at GB neck, no true mass |
| Risk factors | PSC, RPC, choledochal cysts, Caroli's disease, parasites [10] | Gallstones (5Fs) |

#### 5. Recurrent Pyogenic Cholangitis (RPC)

- **Mechanism**: Recurrent cholangitis from de novo intrahepatic pigment stone formation → stricturing and dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tree [11]
- **Why it mimics Mirizzi**: Both cause cholangitis (Charcot's triad), both involve stones, and ***RPC is also an exception to Courvoisier's Law*** [2]. Both are common in the Hong Kong population.
- **How to distinguish**:

| Feature | RPC | Mirizzi Syndrome |
|---|---|---|
| Stone type | ***Brown pigment / calcium bilirubinate stones*** formed de novo in intrahepatic ducts [11] | Usually cholesterol stones formed in gallbladder |
| Stone location | *Intrahepatic* ducts primarily [11] | Hartmann's pouch / cystic duct |
| Imaging | Disproportionate dilatation of intrahepatic ducts (especially left lobe) with intrahepatic stones and strictures [11] | Dilated ducts above GB neck with stone at GB neck; no intrahepatic stones |
| Epidemiology | ***Southeast Asia ("Hong Kong disease")***, equal M:F, peak 30–40s [11] | Follows gallstone epidemiology (F > M) |
| Parasitic association | ***Clonorchis sinensis, Ascaris lumbricoides*** [11] | Not directly parasitic |

#### 6. Liver Abscess

- **Mechanism**: Pyogenic (usually from biliary source or portal pyaemia) or amoebic abscess
- **Why it mimics Mirizzi**: Both cause fever, RUQ pain, and leukocytosis. A large abscess near the porta hepatis could compress the bile ducts.
- **How to distinguish**: USG/CT shows a **fluid collection within the liver parenchyma** (not a stone at GB neck). No intrahepatic duct dilatation pattern characteristic of biliary obstruction unless the abscess itself compresses ducts. Blood cultures/aspirate culture positive for organisms.

#### 7. Infected Choledochal Cysts

- **Mechanism**: Congenital dilatation of biliary tree → bile stasis → infection [12]
- **Why it mimics Mirizzi**: Both cause RUQ pain, jaundice, and fever. Choledochal cysts can present with a palpable mass.
- **How to distinguish**: ***Diagnosed predominantly before age 10 (60%)*** [12]. USG/MRCP shows a **cystic dilatation** of the bile duct rather than a stone at GB neck. Classic triad of RUQ mass + pain + jaundice (though only present in minority of adults).

#### 8. Acute Pancreatitis

- **Mechanism**: Premature activation of pancreatic enzymes → autodigestion [13]
- **Why it mimics Mirizzi**: Both can be caused by gallstones. Both cause RUQ/epigastric pain. Both elevate LFTs.
- **How to distinguish**: Pain in pancreatitis **radiates to the back** and is **relieved by sitting up/leaning forward** [13]. ***Markedly elevated serum amylase/lipase ( > 3× upper limit of normal)***. Pancreatic inflammation on CT. In Mirizzi, amylase may be mildly elevated but not to the degree seen in pancreatitis.

#### 9. Acute Appendicitis

- **Mechanism**: Appendiceal luminal obstruction → distension → ischaemia → bacterial infection [1]
- **Why it is listed**: Both cause acute abdominal pain with fever and leukocytosis. However, appendicitis typically presents with **periumbilical pain migrating to RIF (McBurney's point)**, not RUQ. Jaundice is absent. Listed as a DDx primarily because of the overlap in the "acute abdomen with fever and leucocytosis" category.

#### 10. Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)

- **Mechanism**: Chronic progressive inflammation, fibrosis, and stricturing of both intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts of unknown aetiology [14]
- **Why it mimics Mirizzi**: Both can cause obstructive jaundice at the hilar level [3]. Both can cause cholangitis.
- **How to distinguish**: PSC has a **strong association with ulcerative colitis** [14]. Cholangiogram (MRCP/ERCP) shows ***"beaded" pattern*** of multifocal strictures alternating with dilatation throughout the biliary tree — very different from the focal hilar obstruction of Mirizzi. ***p-ANCA positive in ~80%***. No gallstone at GB neck.

#### 11. Biliary Leaks

- **Mechanism**: Post-surgical or post-traumatic disruption of bile duct integrity
- **Why it mimics Mirizzi**: Both can cause jaundice and biliary collections. However, biliary leaks present in the *post-operative* context. HIDA scan or ERCP demonstrates active extravasation of bile.

### DDx Approach: Differentiating Stone vs. Tumour

***In the history, differentiate stone vs tumour*** [4]:

| Feature | Stone (including Mirizzi) | Tumour (malignant biliary obstruction) |
|---|---|---|
| Pain | ***Painful*** (biliary colic, cholangitis) | Often ***painless*** (especially pancreatic head CA) |
| Jaundice pattern | Intermittent/fluctuating | ***Progressive*** |
| Fever | Common (cholangitis) | Less common unless secondary infection |
| Stool/urine | ***Tea-coloured urine, pale stool*** [4] | Same pattern |
| Weight loss | Less prominent | Significant |
| History of gallstones | Usually present | May be absent |
| Age | Any age (F > M) | Elderly (consider ***painless progressive obstructive jaundice in elderly = malignant until proven otherwise*** [4]) |
| Courvoisier's sign | Usually negative (exception: Mirizzi, double impaction, RPC) [2] | Usually positive |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Mirizzi syndrome DDx — key principles**:

1. **Mirizzi is an extramural cause of obstructive jaundice** — classified with pancreatic head CA and lymphadenopathy, NOT with intraluminal stones [4]

2. **Most commonly confused with choledocholithiasis** — the key USG differentiator is: in Mirizzi, intrahepatic ducts are dilated but CBD is normal-calibre below the GB neck; in choledocholithiasis, the CBD itself is dilated [1]

3. **Acute cholecystitis with disproportionate jaundice** should trigger suspicion for Mirizzi [8]

4. **Always rule out CA gallbladder** with CT (5–28% coexistence rate) and MRCP (T2 differentiates inflammatory from neoplastic mass) [1]

5. **Listed DDx from senior notes** [1]: Choledocholithiasis, Acute cholecystitis, Liver abscess, Infected choledochal cysts, Biliary leaks, Acute pancreatitis, Acute appendicitis, RPC

6. **In Hong Kong**, RPC and parasitic-related biliary disease are particularly important differentials [11]

7. ***Painless progressive obstructive jaundice in elderly = malignant biliary obstruction until proven otherwise*** [4]
