## Complications of Breast Cancer

Complications in breast cancer arise from three sources: (1) the **disease itself** (local progression and distant metastasis), (2) **surgical treatment**, and (3) **adjuvant therapies** (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy). Understanding these complications from first principles — knowing *why* each one happens — is far more valuable for exams and clinical practice than rote memorisation.

### 1. Complications of the Disease Itself

#### 1.1 Local Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiological Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Skin ulceration / fungating tumour** | Advanced tumour erodes through dermis → necrotic, malodorous, bleeding wound. Occurs when tumour outgrows its blood supply (central necrosis) and invades the overlying skin |
| **Peau d'orange** | Tumour cells obstruct ***dermal lymphatic channels*** → lymphatic oedema of skin → pitting at hair follicle/sweat gland openings (tethered by Cooper's ligaments while surrounding skin swells) [1] |
| **Skin dimpling / tethering** | Tumour invades or fibroses ***Cooper's ligaments*** → shortening → retraction of overlying skin |
| **Nipple retraction** | Tumour invades and fibroses subareolar ducts → pulls nipple inward |
| **Arm lymphoedema from axillary obstruction** | Advanced tumour or matted nodal disease obstructs axillary lymphatic drainage (distinct from post-surgical lymphoedema) |
| **Brachial plexus involvement** | Locally advanced tumour or nodal mass invades the brachial plexus (C5–T1 roots) → arm pain, weakness, paraesthesia, and eventually paralysis |
| **Chest wall invasion** | Direct tumour extension into pectoralis major/minor, intercostal muscles, or ribs → pain, fixation, and potential pathological rib fractures |

#### 1.2 Distant Metastatic Complications

***Breast cancer metastasises to: Bone > Liver > Lung > Brain > Ovaries > Adrenals > Pleura*** [1][4].

| Site | Complications | Mechanism | Presentation |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Bone*** (most common site) | ***Pathological fractures***; ***spinal cord compression***; ***hypercalcaemia of malignancy*** | Breast cancer cells produce PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related peptide) and activate RANKL → osteoclastic bone resorption → lytic lesions → structural weakness (fractures) + release of calcium into blood (hypercalcaemia). Vertebral metastases → epidural extension → spinal cord compression | ***Bone pain*** (back, pelvis, long bones), fractures from minimal trauma, progressive leg weakness/sensory loss/bladder dysfunction (cord compression), confusion/constipation/polyuria (hypercalcaemia) |
| ***Liver*** | Hepatic failure; biliary obstruction; portal hypertension | Progressive replacement of hepatic parenchyma with tumour → loss of metabolic, synthetic, and excretory function; mass effect on bile ducts/portal vessels | ***Jaundice, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, ascites, raised LFT*** [1] |
| ***Lung / Pleura*** | Malignant pleural effusion; lymphangitis carcinomatosa; airway obstruction | Tumour cells in pleural lymphatics → impaired lymphatic drainage → fluid accumulation; tumour obstructing bronchi → collapse/infection; lymphangitic spread along pulmonary lymphatics → diffuse interstitial infiltrate | ***Dyspnoea, cough***, reduced breath sounds (effusion), progressive breathlessness at rest (lymphangitis) [1] |
| ***Brain*** | Raised intracranial pressure; focal neurological deficits; seizures | Metastatic deposits act as space-occupying lesions → cerebral oedema → raised ICP; destruction of functional cortex/tracts; irritation of cortex → seizures | Headache (worse in morning), vomiting, papilloedema, hemiparesis, speech disturbance, personality change |
| ***Ovaries / Peritoneum*** | Malignant ascites; ovarian mass; bowel obstruction (especially ILC — ***metastasises to unusual locations including meninges, GI tract, and peritoneum***) [1] | Peritoneal carcinomatosis → impaired peritoneal fluid absorption → ascites; tumour encasement of bowel → obstruction |

> **Skeletal-related events (SREs)** are a specifically defined set of bone metastasis complications: ***pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcaemia of malignancy*** [1]. These are the target outcomes for bone-protective agents (bisphosphonates, denosumab).

<Callout title="Hypercalcaemia of Malignancy — First Principles">
Breast cancer causes hypercalcaemia through **two mechanisms**:
1. **Humoral hypercalcaemia:** Tumour cells secrete PTHrP → acts on PTH receptors in kidney (↑ Ca reabsorption, ↑ phosphate excretion) and bone (↑ osteoclast activity) → ↑ serum calcium
2. **Local osteolytic hypercalcaemia:** Tumour cells in bone directly activate osteoclasts (via RANKL, IL-6, etc.) → bone destruction → calcium release

**Symptoms mnemonic — "Stones, Bones, Groans, and Psychic Moans":**
- **Stones** = renal stones, nephrocalcinosis, polyuria (calcium overwhelms tubular reabsorption)
- **Bones** = bone pain, fractures
- **Groans** = constipation, nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis
- **Psychic Moans** = confusion, depression, lethargy, coma
</Callout>

#### 1.3 Paraneoplastic Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH Secretion)** | Ectopic ADH production by tumour → water retention → ***hyponatraemia*** (dilutional) [1] |
| **Hypercalcaemia** | PTHrP secretion (as above) |
| **Hypercoagulable state (Trousseau syndrome)** | Cancer cells express tissue factor and release procoagulant microparticles → activation of coagulation cascade → DVT, PE, migratory superficial thrombophlebitis |

---

### 2. Complications of Surgical Treatment

#### 2.1 Complications of Mastectomy [1][2]

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism / Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| **General** | ***Wound infection*** [1] | Bacterial contamination of surgical site; risk increased by haematoma, seroma, diabetes, obesity |
| | ***Bleeding and haematoma*** [1] | Intra-operative vessel injury or post-operative coagulopathy → blood collection in surgical dead space |
| | ***Anaesthetic complications*** [1] | General anaesthesia-related: aspiration, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, cardiac events |
| **Specific — Early** | ***Seroma*** [1][2] | Collection of serous fluid in the surgical dead space. After mastectomy, the breast tissue is removed leaving a large potential space between skin flaps and chest wall. Disrupted lymphatic and blood capillaries leak fluid into this space. ***Untreated seroma → delayed wound healing, wound infection, dehiscence, flap necrosis, and poor cosmetic outcomes.*** Management: ***insertion of drains*** (Jackson-Pratt closed-suction drains) or ***percutaneous aspiration*** [1][2] |
| | ***Skin flap necrosis*** [1][2] | Thin skin flaps created during mastectomy may have compromised blood supply (especially at the distal edges) → ischaemic necrosis. ***Full-thickness necrosis requires surgical debridement ± skin grafting*** [1]. Risk increased in smokers, diabetics, and after skin-sparing procedures |
| | ***NAC necrosis*** (if nipple-sparing) [2] | Blood supply to the preserved nipple-areolar complex can be compromised by the surgery → ischaemic necrosis. Risk increases with large, ptotic breasts |
| **Specific — Late** | ***Post-mastectomy pain syndrome*** [1] | ***Burning, aching, and tight constriction of axilla, upper arm, and chest wall*** [1]. Mechanism: neuropathic pain from intercostal nerve injury during surgery (nerves cut or stretched when elevating skin flaps); also phantom breast pain (see below). Can be chronic and debilitating |
| | ***Phantom breast syndrome*** [1][2] | ***Altered chest wall sensation; exact cause is unknown*** [1]; ***might persist years after surgery*** [2]. Analogous to phantom limb pain — the somatosensory cortex retains a neural representation of the breast; deafferentation → aberrant signalling interpreted as sensation from the absent breast |
| | ***Arm morbidity*** [1][2] | ***Arm or shoulder pain, swelling, numbness, stiffness*** [1]. Causes include nerve injury, lymphoedema, immobility-related frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) |

#### 2.2 Complications of Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND) [2]

ALND carries significantly more morbidity than SLNB — this is precisely why SLNB was developed: ***suitable for early-stage cancers to avoid full axillary dissection which has complications*** [12].

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| ***Seroma*** [2] | Disruption of lymphatic channels during dissection → lymphatic fluid accumulates in the axillary space | Fluctuant swelling in axilla; requires aspiration or drainage |
| ***Long thoracic nerve injury*** [2] | Nerve runs along the chest wall on the surface of serratus anterior; vulnerable during dissection of Level I–II nodes | ***Winged scapula*** — serratus anterior is paralysed → medial border of scapula protrudes posteriorly, especially when pushing against a wall. Why? Serratus anterior protracts and rotates the scapula; without it, the scapula cannot be held against the thoracic cage |
| ***Thoracodorsal nerve injury*** [2] | Nerve runs with thoracodorsal vessels posterior to axillary vein | ***Weakness of latissimus dorsi → impaired shoulder adduction and internal rotation*** (difficulty pulling arm down or behind back) |
| ***Medial pectoral nerve injury*** [2] | Nerve pierces pectoralis minor to supply pectoralis major; courses through Level II nodal tissue | ***Wasting of pectoralis major*** → cosmetic deformity of anterior chest wall, weakness of shoulder adduction |
| ***Intercostobrachial nerve injury*** [2] | T2 intercostal nerve branch crosses the axilla; ***almost always sacrificed in ALND*** [2] | ***Paraesthesia (numbness/tingling) of axilla, medial arm, and lateral chest wall*** [2]. This is so common that patients should be warned pre-operatively |
| ***Upper limb lymphoedema*** [2] | Removal of axillary lymph nodes disrupts the lymphatic drainage of the arm → lymph fluid accumulates in subcutaneous tissue → chronic swelling | Progressive, often irreversible limb swelling; discomfort; recurrent cellulitis (stagnant lymph = culture medium for bacteria); skin thickening. ***Management: pneumatic compression device*** [2], compression garments, manual lymphatic drainage, skin care |
| ***Upper limb lymphangiosarcoma (Stewart-Treves syndrome)*** [2] | Chronic lymphoedema → sustained lymphatic stasis → chronic inflammatory microenvironment → ***malignant transformation of lymphatic endothelium*** after years to decades | ***Rare but devastating*** — angiosarcoma arising in a chronically lymphoedematous limb. Typically presents as purple/bruise-like patches or nodules on the swollen arm, years after mastectomy + ALND. Very poor prognosis |

<Callout title="Stewart-Treves Syndrome" type="error">
This is a classic exam point: ***lymphangiosarcoma arising in a chronically lymphoedematous upper limb after mastectomy and axillary dissection***. The latency period is typically **5–15 years** after surgery. It highlights why minimising axillary surgery (using SLNB instead of ALND when appropriate) is so important — it is not just about numbness and stiffness; chronic lymphoedema carries the risk of a lethal secondary malignancy.
</Callout>

#### 2.3 Complications of Breast Reconstruction [2]

##### 2.3.1 Implant-Related Complications

| Complication | Detail |
|---|---|
| ***Mechanical: migration, malposition, exposure, rupture*** [2] | ***Majority of ruptures are often silent*** — present with ***changes in breast shape/volume, capsular contracture, palpable lumps (breast or axilla), and pain*** [2]. Silicone leakage can migrate to axillary lymph nodes (palpable lumps in axilla that may mimic recurrence) |
| ***Implant infection*** [2] | Bacterial colonisation of the implant surface (biofilm). ***Managed by antibiotics ± explantation and irrigation of the pocket → closure over closed-suction drainage*** [2] |
| ***Capsular contracture*** [2] | The body forms a fibrous capsule around any foreign body (normal immune response). When this capsule contracts excessively → ***painful, fibrous capsule around implant → palpable distortion of breast*** [2]. ***Especially common post-infection or post-radiation*** (radiation accelerates fibrosis). Graded by Baker classification (I = soft/natural → IV = hard/painful/distorted) |
| ***Breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL)*** [2] | A rare but important complication. ***ALK-negative, CD30-positive*** T-cell lymphoma arising around textured breast implants. Typically presents as a late seroma (fluid collection around the implant years after insertion). ***Disease confined to the capsule: capsulectomy alone is curative.*** Disseminated disease: ***adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or anti-CD30 therapy (brentuximab vedotin)*** [2] |

##### 2.3.2 Autologous Flap Complications

| Flap | Specific Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***TRAM flap*** | ***Abdominal hernia / bulge*** [2] | Harvest of rectus abdominis muscle weakens the anterior abdominal wall |
| | Donor site seroma/infection | Large soft tissue harvest site |
| ***DIEP flap*** | ***Complete flap loss*** [2] | ***Requires microsurgery*** (inferior epigastric vessels anastomosed to internal mammary vessels); ***risk of failed micro-anastomosis → flap ischaemia → loss*** [2]. Longer operative time |
| ***LD flap*** | ***Limited range of motion at shoulder*** [2] | Latissimus dorsi is sacrificed; functionally significant in athletes/manual workers |

---

### 3. Complications of Adjuvant Therapies

#### 3.1 Radiotherapy Complications [1]

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Short-term** | ***Breast/chest wall skin fibrosis*** [1][2] | Radiation damages dermal fibroblasts → excessive collagen deposition → skin thickening, tightness, telangiectasia (dilated superficial blood vessels — radiation damages endothelium → compensatory angiogenesis with fragile vessels) |
| | ***Arm oedema*** [1] | Radiation to axilla/supraclavicular field damages remaining lymphatic channels → impaired drainage → oedema (synergistic with surgical lymphatic disruption from ALND) |
| | ***Radiation dermatitis*** | Acute inflammatory response of the skin to ionising radiation — erythema, desquamation, occasionally moist desquamation |
| **Long-term** | ***Rib fracture*** [1] | Radiation-induced osteonecrosis of underlying ribs → weakened bone → insufficiency fractures (especially left-sided treatment involving lower ribs) |
| | ***Cardiotoxicity*** [1][2] | ***Especially with left-sided breast RT*** — the heart is in the radiation field. Radiation damages coronary artery endothelium → accelerated atherosclerosis; damages myocardium → fibrosis → cardiomyopathy; pericardial inflammation → pericarditis/effusion. Modern techniques (deep inspiratory breath-hold, IMRT, proton therapy) aim to minimise cardiac dose |
| | ***Pulmonary fibrosis or pneumonitis*** [1][2] | Radiation damages alveolar epithelium and pulmonary endothelium → inflammatory pneumonitis (weeks to months) → pulmonary fibrosis (months to years) |
| | ***Secondary RT-induced malignancy*** [1][2] | Radiation is carcinogenic — can induce secondary cancers (sarcomas, contralateral breast cancer, lung cancer) in the irradiated field. Typically appears ≥ 5–10 years after RT. Risk is small but non-zero and must be weighed against benefit |
| Regional nodal irradiation | ***Lymphoedema; axillary fibrosis*** [1] | Same lymphatic damage mechanism as above; compounded if ALND also performed |

#### 3.2 Chemotherapy Complications

| Agent / Regimen | Key Side Effects | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **General (all chemo)** | Myelosuppression (neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia), nausea/vomiting, alopecia, mucositis, fatigue, immunosuppression | Chemotherapy targets all rapidly dividing cells — bone marrow, GI mucosa, hair follicles are collateral damage |
| ***Anthracyclines (doxorubicin)*** | ***Cardiotoxicity*** (dose-dependent, cumulative) | Generates reactive oxygen species → direct myocyte damage; also topoisomerase IIβ-mediated DNA damage in cardiomyocytes → irreversible myocyte death → dilated cardiomyopathy. Cumulative dose limit typically ~450–550 mg/m² |
| ***Cyclophosphamide*** | Haemorrhagic cystitis | Metabolite acrolein is excreted by kidneys and damages bladder urothelium. Prevented by adequate hydration and ***mesna*** (binds acrolein in urine) |
| ***Taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel)*** | Peripheral neuropathy (sensory > motor), myalgias/arthralgias | Stabilises microtubules → disrupts axonal transport in peripheral nerves → neuropathy |
| ***Methotrexate*** | Mucositis, hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression | Folate antagonist → inhibits dihydrofolate reductase → impaired DNA synthesis in all rapidly dividing cells. Rescued with leucovorin (folinic acid) |

#### 3.3 Hormonal Therapy Complications

| Agent | Key Side Effects | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***Tamoxifen*** [2] | ***Weight gain; hot flushes; ↑ risk of endometrial carcinoma; VTE (DVT/PE)*** [2] | Tamoxifen is a SERM — it **blocks** ER in breast (therapeutic) but **activates** ER in endometrium → endometrial proliferation → ↑ risk of endometrial hyperplasia/cancer. Activates ER in liver → ↑ clotting factors (especially Factor V, fibrinogen) → pro-thrombotic state → VTE |
| ***Aromatase Inhibitors (letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane)*** [2] | ***Osteoporosis / fractures***; arthralgia; cardiovascular risk [2] | Complete oestrogen deprivation in post-menopausal women. Oestrogen is protective for bone (inhibits osteoclasts, promotes osteoblasts); removing it → accelerated bone loss → osteoporosis → fractures. Also removes cardioprotective effects of oestrogen |
| ***GnRH agonists (goserelin)*** | Menopausal symptoms (hot flushes, vaginal dryness), osteoporosis | Chemical ovarian suppression → iatrogenic menopause → oestrogen deficiency symptoms |

> **Why does tamoxifen cause endometrial cancer but aromatase inhibitors do not?** Tamoxifen has tissue-specific effects — it is an ER **antagonist** in the breast but an ER **agonist** in the endometrium and liver. AIs, on the other hand, do not activate ER anywhere — they simply reduce the amount of oestrogen available. So the endometrium is deprived of oestrogen stimulus and actually atrophies. This is why AIs carry a fracture risk (bone also lacks oestrogen) but NOT an endometrial cancer risk.

#### 3.4 Targeted Therapy Complications

| Agent | Key Side Effects | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***Trastuzumab (Herceptin)*** [2] | ***Cardiotoxicity*** (reduced LVEF, heart failure); ***hypersensitivity reactions*** [2] | HER2 receptors are expressed on cardiomyocytes and are involved in cardiac repair and stress response. Blocking HER2 with trastuzumab → impaired cardiac stress response → cardiomyopathy. ***Unlike anthracycline cardiotoxicity, trastuzumab cardiotoxicity is typically reversible*** and not dose-dependent (does not cause myocyte death; rather, impairs function). ***Not used concurrently with anthracyclines*** (combined cardiotoxicity would be excessive) [2] |
| ***PARP inhibitors (olaparib)*** | Myelosuppression (anaemia, neutropenia), nausea, fatigue, risk of MDS/AML (rare) | PARP is involved in DNA repair in all cells; inhibiting it in bone marrow progenitors → impaired repair → myelosuppression; in rare cases, genomic instability → secondary haematological malignancy |
| ***CDK4/6 inhibitors (abemaciclib)*** | Diarrhoea, neutropenia, fatigue | CDK4/6 drives cell cycle in many tissues; GI epithelium and bone marrow are affected |

#### 3.5 Bone Therapy Complications

| Agent | Key Side Effects | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid, pamidronic acid)*** | Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ); renal toxicity; flu-like reaction | ONJ: bisphosphonates are concentrated in bone and suppress osteoclast activity → impaired bone remodelling → jaw (high turnover bone exposed to oral flora via dental procedures) → necrosis. Renal: direct tubular toxicity, especially with rapid IV infusion |
| ***Denosumab*** | Osteonecrosis of the jaw; hypocalcaemia | RANKL blockade → profound osteoclast inhibition → impaired calcium mobilisation from bone → hypocalcaemia (must supplement calcium and vitamin D). ONJ mechanism similar to bisphosphonates |

### 4. Complications by Timeline — Summary Table

| Timeline | Surgical | RT | Systemic Therapy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Immediate / Early** | Bleeding, haematoma, wound infection, seroma, skin flap/NAC necrosis, nerve injuries (ALND) | Radiation dermatitis, fatigue | Myelosuppression, nausea, alopecia, mucositis |
| **Intermediate** | Frozen shoulder, wound dehiscence | Pneumonitis | Peripheral neuropathy (taxanes), haemorrhagic cystitis (cyclophosphamide) |
| **Late / Chronic** | Post-mastectomy pain syndrome, phantom breast syndrome, lymphoedema, Stewart-Treves syndrome | Skin fibrosis/telangiectasia, rib fracture, cardiotoxicity, pulmonary fibrosis, RT-induced malignancy | Cardiotoxicity (anthracyclines, trastuzumab), endometrial cancer (tamoxifen), VTE (tamoxifen), osteoporosis (AIs), ONJ (bisphosphonates), BIA-ALCL (implants) |

---

### 5. Prognosis [1]

#### 5.1 Prognostic Factors Associated with Poor Prognosis

| Category | Poor Prognostic Factors |
|---|---|
| **Patient factors** | ***Extreme of age*** (very young or very old); ***smoking*** |
| **Tumour size** | ***Large tumour size (higher T stage)*** |
| **Nodal status** | ***Greater number of nodal involvement (N)***. N0: 5-year survival ~70%. More nodes → worse survival [2] |
| **Metastasis** | ***Presence of metastatic disease (M1)*** |
| **Grade** | ***Poorly differentiated (Grade 3)*** |
| **Proliferation** | ***High Ki67*** (detected by IHC) — indicates rapid tumour cell division |
| **Histological subtype** | ***IDC, ILC, mixed ductal/lobular, metaplastic, micropapillary*** (poor prognosis subtypes); ***tubular, medullary, mucinous, papillary*** (good prognosis subtypes) [1] |
| **Receptor status** | ***Absence of ER and PR expression*** (no endocrine therapy option); ***HER2 overexpression*** (aggressive biology, though now targetable) [1] |

#### 5.2 Five-Year Survival in Hong Kong [1]

| Stage | 5-Year Survival |
|---|---|
| ***Stage I*** | ***97.5%*** |
| ***Stage II*** | ***87.8%*** |
| ***Stage III*** | ***66.2%*** |
| ***Stage IV*** | ***19.3%*** |

> The dramatic drop from Stage I (97.5%) to Stage IV (19.3%) underscores why early detection through screening is so impactful. The biological behaviour is the same cancer — the difference is whether you catch it before or after it has spread systemically.

(3) Medial pectoral nerve - wasting of pectoralis major. (4) Intercostobrachial nerve - paraesthesia of axilla, medial arm, and lateral chest wall.

      markscheme: "Tamoxifen is a SERM - ER antagonist in breast but ER agonist in endometrium. It stimulates endometrial proliferation, increasing risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. AIs reduce circulating oestrogen levels without activating ER anywhere, so the endometrium atrophies rather than proliferates. AIs instead cause osteoporosis/fractures (loss of oestrogen bone protection). Tamoxifen also increases risk of VTE (DVT/PE) because ER agonist effect in liver increases clotting factor synthesis."

      markscheme: "Stewart-Treves syndrome = lymphangiosarcoma arising in a chronically lymphoedematous upper limb after mastectomy and axillary dissection. Pathogenesis: chronic lymphoedema causes sustained lymphatic stasis and inflammatory microenvironment, leading to malignant transformation of lymphatic endothelium over years to decades (typical latency 5-15 years). Presents as purple/bruise-like patches or nodules on swollen arm. Very poor prognosis. Highlights importance of minimising axillary surgery (SLNB over ALND when possible)."

Mechanism: reactive oxygen species + topoisomerase IIB-mediated DNA damage in cardiomyocytes causing irreversible myocyte death leading to dilated cardiomyopathy. Dose limit ~450-550 mg/m2. Trastuzumab cardiotoxicity: NOT dose-dependent, typically REVERSIBLE. Mechanism: HER2 is expressed on cardiomyocytes for cardiac repair; blocking it impairs cardiac stress response but does not cause myocyte death.

Two mechanisms: (1) Humoral - tumour secretes PTHrP which acts on PTH receptors in kidney (increased Ca reabsorption, increased phosphate excretion) and bone (increased osteoclast activity). (2) Local osteolytic - tumour cells in bone directly activate osteoclasts via RANKL/IL-6 causing bone destruction and calcium release. SREs include pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcaemia. Treated with bisphosphonates/denosumab, IV fluids, calcitonin, and loop diuretics."
