## Differential Diagnosis of Breast Cancer

The differential diagnosis of breast cancer really means: "A patient presents with a breast complaint — what could it be other than cancer, and how do I systematically work through the possibilities?" The approach differs depending on the **presenting complaint**: a **breast lump**, **nipple discharge**, **nipple/skin change**, or **mastalgia**. We will cover each systematically, explain *why* each mimicker can look like cancer, and clarify the distinguishing features.

### 1. Framework for Thinking About the Differential

Before diving in, understand the conceptual scaffold. Breast pathology can be classified under the **ANDI framework** (Aberrations of Normal Development and Involution) [2][8]:

- **Development (15–25 years):** Fibroadenoma, juvenile hypertrophy
- **Cyclical changes (25–55 years):** Fibrocystic changes, cyclical mastalgia, nodularity
- **Involution ( > 35–55 years):** Cysts, duct ectasia, sclerosing adenosis

Superimposed on this physiological framework are **neoplastic** (benign and malignant), **infective/inflammatory**, and **miscellaneous** conditions. The key clinical question is always: **Is this cancer or not?** — which is why the **triple assessment** (clinical + radiological + pathological) exists.

### 2. Differential Diagnosis by Presenting Complaint

#### 2.1 Breast Lump — The Most Common Presentation

The DDx depends heavily on **age** and **characteristics** of the lump [2]:

| | ***Young ( < 35)*** | ***Older ( > 35)*** |
|---|---|---|
| **Soft** | Fibrocystic changes | Fibrocystic changes |
| **Firm** | ***Fibroadenoma*** | ***Carcinoma*** |
| | Fat necrosis | Fat necrosis (bruising history) |
| | Lipoma | Lipoma |
| | Breast cyst (tense, fluctuant) | ***Phyllodes tumour*** (freely mobile) |

> **Why does age matter?** Because the pre-test probability of malignancy changes dramatically with age. In a 20-year-old, a firm mobile lump is overwhelmingly likely to be a fibroadenoma. In a 55-year-old, the same lump mandates urgent triple assessment to exclude carcinoma. The background incidence of breast cancer rises exponentially with age (accumulation of somatic mutations + longer cumulative oestrogen exposure).

Now let us go through each differential in detail.

#### 2.1.1 Fibroadenoma

The ***most common benign tumour of the breast*** [1][2].

| Feature | Detail | Why / Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | Benign solid tumour containing glandular and fibrous tissue (fibro = fibrous; adeno = glandular; -oma = tumour) | Proliferation of both stromal and epithelial components of the TDLU [1][2] |
| **Age** | Reproductive age (15–35) | Likely a **hormonally-dependent neoplasm** — increases in size during pregnancy or with oestrogen-based OCP; persists during reproductive years; ***decreases in size or regresses after menopause*** [1] |
| **Clinical presentation** | ***"Breast mouse"*** — a highly mobile, well-defined, rubbery, non-tender mass [1] | The tumour is encapsulated within its own pseudocapsule and sits freely within breast tissue, hence the extreme mobility (slides under your finger like a mouse running away) |
| **Distinguishing from cancer** | Mobile (cancer is fixed), smooth borders (cancer is irregular), non-tender, does NOT cause skin changes or nipple retraction | Cancer invades Cooper's ligaments (dimpling, fixation) and ducts (retraction) — fibroadenoma does not |
| **Cancer risk** | ***Simple fibroadenoma: NO increased risk***; ***Complex fibroadenoma*** (with papillary apocrine changes, ductal hyperplasia, sclerosing adenosis): ***higher risk*** [1] | Complex histological changes indicate increased proliferative activity within the lesion |
| **Giant fibroadenoma** | Defined as > 10 cm; ***CANNOT be distinguished from Phyllodes tumour on examination or imaging*** → must excise [1] | Both are fibroepithelial lesions; the stroma in Phyllodes is more cellular and can become malignant |
| **Management** | Conservative if < 2 cm with concordant imaging; ***wide local excision if symptomatic, > 2 cm, or increasing in size*** [1][2] | Not necessary to excise every biopsy-proven fibroadenoma — surgery can cause scarring and breast deformity |

#### 2.1.2 Breast Cyst

| Feature | Detail | Why / Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | ***Epithelial-lined fluid-filled cavity*** derived from the TDLU [1][8] | Fluid accumulates due to distension and obstruction of the efferent ductule of the TDLU [1] |
| **Age** | Young to perimenopausal women | Part of the involutionary spectrum — lobular involution with cystic dilation |
| **Clinical presentation** | Soft, fluctuant, well-defined, mobile lump; may be tender (especially with acute enlargement causing sudden-onset pain) [1][8] | Rapid distension of the cyst wall stretches pain fibres |
| **Distinguishing from cancer** | ***USG: simple anechoic fluid-filled structure*** with posterior acoustic enhancement — definitively benign. Complex cysts (with internal echoes/septae/solid component) need further workup | Cancer is a solid mass on USG; a simple cyst is never cancer |
| **Management** | Reassurance; ***aspiration*** (therapeutic and diagnostic — if blood-stained aspirate, recurrent, or radiologically suspicious → cytology and further workup) [2][8] | If the cyst disappears completely after aspiration and the fluid is not bloody, it is benign. Recurrence or solid component → excision |

#### 2.1.3 Fibrocystic Changes (Fibroadenosis)

The ***most common benign disorder of the breast*** [1][8].

| Feature | Detail | Why / Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | NOT a disease but a spectrum of histopathological changes: stromal fibrosis, macro/microcysts, apocrine metaplasia, hyperplasia, adenosis [1] | Result of hormonal imbalance — ***oestrogen predominance over progesterone*** causing exaggerated cyclical changes [1] |
| **Age** | Reproductive (premenopausal) | Driven by menstrual cycle hormonal fluctuations |
| **Clinical presentation** | ***Cyclical painful mass/nodularity*** (worse before menses, improves after onset of menstrual flow); serosanguinous nipple discharge possible [1][8] | Oestrogen-driven proliferation and oedema in the first half of the cycle → engorgement and tenderness pre-menstrually; regression with progesterone withdrawal |
| **Distinguishing from cancer** | Cyclical variation (cancer lumps do NOT wax and wane with menstrual cycle); bilateral and diffuse rather than a single discrete hard mass | Cancer grows progressively; fibrocystic changes fluctuate |
| **Cancer risk** | Depends on histology (see ACP table [4]): ***no increased risk*** for simple cysts, fibrosis, mild hyperplasia; ***slightly increased (1.5–2×)*** for moderate/florid hyperplasia; ***moderately increased (5×) for atypical hyperplasia (ductal or lobular)*** [4] | Atypia = cells are acquiring pre-malignant features (abnormal architecture and cytology) |
| **Management** | Reassurance, avoid caffeine, evening primrose oil, analgesics, COC (to suppress cyclical hormonal fluctuation) [8] | — |

#### 2.1.4 Phyllodes Tumour

"Phyllodes" from Greek *phyllon* = leaf — refers to the characteristic **leaf-like architecture** on histology [1][2].

| Feature | Detail | Why / Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | ***Fibroepithelial tumour*** (aka serocystic disease of Brodie) — classified as benign, borderline, or malignant [1][2] | Similar to fibroadenoma but with more cellular stroma that can undergo malignant transformation |
| **Age** | ***Older women ( > 40)*** [2] | Unlike fibroadenoma which peaks in youth |
| **Clinical presentation** | ***Smooth, painless, mobile mass*** — can grow very large rapidly [2] | Rapid stromal proliferation → fast growth distinguishes it from the slowly growing fibroadenoma |
| **Distinguishing from cancer** | Mobile (cancer is fixed), smooth surface; but ***can be malignant*** — and malignant Phyllodes ***metastasises via blood (haematogenous), NOT lymphatics → ALND is NOT required*** [2] | Sarcomatous stroma spreads haematogenously like other sarcomas, not via lymphatic routes like carcinomas |
| **Axillary lymphadenopathy** | Occurs in ~20% but is usually ***reactive*** (not metastatic) [1] | The large tumour causes local inflammation → reactive nodal hyperplasia |
| **Management** | ***Wide local excision with margin of at least 1 cm*** (mastectomy if adequate margin cannot be achieved) [2] | Wide margins are essential because of the high local recurrence rate; unlike fibroadenoma, simple enucleation is inadequate |

<Callout title="Phyllodes vs Fibroadenoma — Key Distinction" type="error">
Giant fibroadenoma ( > 10 cm) ***CANNOT be distinguished from Phyllodes tumour on physical examination or imaging*** [1]. If you cannot differentiate, you must excise. On core needle biopsy, features favouring Phyllodes include: increased stromal cellularity, mitoses, stromal overgrowth, leaf-like architecture, and fragmentation [1].
</Callout>

#### 2.1.5 Fat Necrosis

| Feature | Detail | Why / Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | ***Ischaemic necrosis of fat lobules*** [8] | Disrupted blood supply to fat → necrosis → inflammatory repair → fibrosis → hard lump |
| **Risk factors** | ***Trauma, iatrogenic (e.g., breast reconstruction, surgery, radiation)*** [8] | Direct physical damage to adipose tissue |
| **Clinical presentation** | ***Mimics carcinoma clinically***: painless lump with ***skin dimpling, nipple retraction*** [8] | Fibrosis from fat necrosis tethers Cooper's ligaments and ducts, producing the same signs as cancer |
| **Imaging** | ***Mimics carcinoma radiologically*** — spiculated mass, calcifications [8] | Dystrophic calcification in necrotic fat; surrounding fibrosis creates spiculated margins |
| **Diagnosis** | ***Core biopsy to differentiate from cancer*** [8] — shows foamy macrophages, giant cells, fibrosis, fat globules surrounded by inflammatory infiltrate | The only way to be certain is tissue diagnosis |
| **Management** | Reassurance, analgesics [8] | Self-limiting; no treatment needed once cancer is excluded |

#### 2.1.6 Lipoma

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Nature** | Benign tumour of mature adipose tissue |
| **Clinical presentation** | Soft, well-defined, non-tender, mobile subcutaneous mass |
| **Distinguishing from cancer** | Soft consistency (cancer is hard); superficial and mobile; on imaging, fat density with thin capsule |
| **Management** | Conservative unless symptomatic → excision |

#### 2.1.7 Other Conditions Mimicking a Breast Lump

| Condition | Key Points |
|---|---|
| **Sclerosing adenosis / Radial scars** | ***Pathological diagnosis: lobular lesions with increased fibrosis*** [2]; ***can mimic carcinoma*** both clinically and on mammography → core biopsy to differentiate [2] |
| **Adenoma** | Benign glandular tumour, older age; ***can mimic carcinoma*** [2] |
| **Diabetic (DM) mastopathy** | Occurs in premenopausal women with Type 1 DM; hard mass from lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis; ***does NOT increase breast cancer risk*** [1]; autoimmune-mediated |
| **Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH)** | Benign stromal proliferation; can present as a firm mass; biopsy to exclude angiosarcoma [1] |
| **Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM)** | ***Rare benign inflammatory disease mimicking carcinoma***; young parous women; ***self-limiting (resolves 9–12 months)***; ***NO increased cancer risk***; diagnosis of exclusion after excluding TB, sarcoidosis; biopsy shows granulomatous lesions centred on lobules [1] |

---

#### 2.2 Nipple Discharge

Nipple discharge is the second most common breast complaint. The critical question is: **Is this physiological or pathological?** [1][2]

**History-taking for nipple discharge** [2]:
- ***True nipple discharge?*** (from the nipple orifice, not skin)
- ***Unilateral or bilateral?***
- ***Colour of discharge?***
- ***Recent pregnancy/breastfeeding?***
- ***Single duct or multiple ducts?***
- ***Spontaneous or expressible?***

| Feature | Likely Benign | Suspicious for Malignancy |
|---|---|---|
| Laterality | Bilateral | ***Unilateral*** |
| Number of ducts | Multiple | ***Single duct*** |
| Colour | Milky, yellow, green | ***Bloody or serosanguinous*** |
| Spontaneity | Only with expression | ***Spontaneous*** |

**DDx by colour** [1][2]:

| Colour | Differential Diagnosis | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Milky (bilateral, multiple ducts)** | Physiological (pregnancy, lactation), ***Galactorrhoea*** (hyperprolactinaemia: prolactinoma, antipsychotics like haloperidol/risperidone, antiemetics like metoclopramide/domperidone, hypothyroidism, CKD) [1] | Prolactin drives milk production; any cause of elevated prolactin → bilateral milky discharge. Drug-induced: dopamine normally inhibits prolactin release from the anterior pituitary; dopamine antagonists (antipsychotics, metoclopramide) remove this inhibition → hyperprolactinaemia |
| **Yellow/green/black (multicoloured)** | ***Ductal ectasia*** [1][8] | Abnormal dilatation of subareolar ducts with accumulation of lipid-rich secretions → "creamy, cheesy" discharge; can be green/blue/black depending on duration and oxidation of lipid material |
| **Serous/serosanguinous** | ***Intraductal papilloma*** (most common cause of pathological nipple discharge) [1][2], fibrocystic changes, DCIS | Papilloma: muscularis arteries supply the peduncle but lymphatics/veins are compromised → increased vascular pressure → transudate into duct lumen [1] |
| ***Bloody*** | ***Intraductal papilloma*** (bleeding from friable papilloma surface), ***CA breast/DCIS***, fibrocystic changes with active intraductal component [1][2] | Tumour or papilloma erodes into blood vessels within the duct wall → haemorrhagic discharge |

> ***Malignancy is the underlying cause in 5–15% of cases of pathological nipple discharge, and the most common malignancy associated is DCIS*** [1].

**Investigations for nipple discharge** [2]:
- ***Triple assessment***
- ***± Nipple discharge cytology***
- ***± Ductogram / ductoscopy*** (to localise intraductal lesion before microdochectomy)

---

#### 2.3 Nipple/Skin Changes

| Condition | Presentation | Mechanism | How to Distinguish from Cancer |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Paget's disease of the nipple*** [1][3][9] | ***Eczematous changes involving the nipple***; unilateral; ***associated with malignancy within the same breast (~80%)***; ***malignant epithelial (Paget) cells infiltrate and proliferate in the epidermis, causing thickening of the nipple and areolar skin*** [9] | Malignant intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells migrate from underlying ductal carcinoma into nipple epidermis via lactiferous ducts | This IS cancer (or associated with cancer). Not a mimic but a **special presentation** of breast cancer. Diagnosed by ***full-thickness wedge biopsy*** showing Paget cells [1]. ***Mammography mandatory*** to look for associated mass and exclude synchronous cancers [1] |
| **Nipple eczema (dermatitis)** | Bilateral, involves areola more than nipple, itchy, responds to topical steroids | Contact dermatitis or atopic eczema — allergen-mediated immune response | Bilateral involvement and areolar predominance favours eczema. Paget's is ***unilateral, centred on the nipple***, does not respond to steroids, and progressively worsens |
| **Duct ectasia** | ***Nipple retraction*** (from periductal fibrosis), "blue breast" (cyst with dark fluid), multicoloured discharge [8] | Dilated subareolar ducts → inflammation → fibrosis → nipple retraction and periductal mastitis | ***NOT associated with increased cancer risk*** [1]; nipple retraction from duct ectasia is often bilateral and gradual, while cancer-related retraction is unilateral and progressive |
| ***Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)*** [1][2] | ***Painful swollen breast with erythema, oedema, peau d'orange involving at least 1/3 of breast***; ***T4d*** | ***Invasion of local dermal lymphatic ducts*** by tumour → lymphatic obstruction → cutaneous oedema [2] | ***IBC resembles mastitis*** but is ***NOT a true inflammatory process*** — ***no fever, no leukocytosis*** (unlike mastitis which has both) [1]. If "mastitis" does not respond to antibiotics within 1–2 weeks → must biopsy to exclude IBC |
| **Lactational mastitis** | Tender, swollen, erythematous breast in a breastfeeding woman; fever, leukocytosis; may progress to abscess [1] | ***S. aureus*** (most common) or streptococci enter through nipple fissures → infection of breast tissue → suppurative inflammation [8] | Fever + leukocytosis + lactational context → mastitis. Responds to antibiotics. If no response → consider abscess or IBC |
| **Mondor's disease** | ***Palpable subcutaneous cord*** along the breast/chest wall; chest pain [8] | ***Superficial sclerosing thrombophlebitis*** of breast/chest wall veins (***thoraco-epigastric vein*** most common, also lateral thoracic, superior epigastric) [8] | The palpable cord is diagnostic; no breast mass; self-limiting |

<Callout title="Paget's Disease vs. Nipple Eczema" type="error">
A classic exam trap. **Paget's** = ***unilateral***, centred on the **nipple**, does NOT respond to steroids, progressively worsens, associated with underlying carcinoma. **Eczema** = usually **bilateral**, involves the **areola** more than the nipple, responds to topical steroids. When in doubt, ***biopsy*** [9].
</Callout>

---

#### 2.4 Mastalgia (Breast Pain)

| Type | Most Common Cause | Other Differentials | Approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Cyclical*** (worsens pre-menstrually, improves after menses) | ***Fibrocystic changes*** (most common) [2] | Normal physiological | ***Cyclical or bilateral diffuse pain: no imaging required; reassurance, conservative (NSAID)*** [2] |
| ***Non-cyclical*** (constant, no relationship to cycle) | Acute mastitis, fibroadenoma, ***inflammatory breast cancer*** [2] | Costochondritis (Tietze syndrome), fat necrosis, breast cyst (acute enlargement), diabetic mastopathy | ***Non-cyclical / unilateral / focal pain: USG / mammogram*** to exclude malignancy [2] |

> **Why is breast cancer usually painless?** Most breast cancers grow insidiously within the parenchyma without acutely stretching the breast capsule or involving pain-sensitive structures. Exceptions include inflammatory breast cancer (dermal lymphatic obstruction → rapid oedema → stretching → pain) and locally advanced cancers invading the chest wall or intercostal nerves.

---

### 3. Pre-malignant Conditions (High-Risk Lesions)

These deserve special mention because they sit on the continuum between benign and malignant — they are **not yet cancer** but significantly increase the risk and may harbour occult malignancy [1][5]:

#### 3.1 Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia (ADH) / Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia (ALH)

| Feature | Detail | Why / Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Definition** | Proliferative lesions with cellular atypia arising from breast ducts (ADH) or lobules (ALH) [1] | Represent an intermediate step between normal hyperplasia and carcinoma in situ — cells show architectural distortion and cytological atypia but do not fully meet criteria for CIS |
| **ADH pathology** | Proliferation of uniform epithelial cells with monomorphic round nuclei filling **part but not entirely** the involved duct [1] | If the duct is **completely** filled with atypical cells → DCIS. ADH = partially involved |
| **ALH pathology** | Monomorphic, evenly spaced dyshesive cells filling **part but not entirely** the involved lobule [1] | If the lobule is **completely** filled → LCIS. ALH = partially involved |
| **Cancer risk** | ***ADH: 4–5× increased relative risk of invasive breast cancer*** [1]; ***ALH: similar risk*** [1] | Cells have already acquired some pre-malignant mutations; further hits can complete the transformation |
| **Critical management point** | ***If atypical hyperplasia found on core needle biopsy → excisional biopsy MUST be performed to rule out associated malignancy*** [1][2] | Core needle biopsy samples only a small portion of the lesion. There may be adjacent DCIS or invasive cancer that was missed by the needle. Excisional biopsy examines the entire lesion |
| **If excision shows malignancy** | Manage according to final histology (DCIS/IDC, LCIS/ILC) [1] | — |
| **If excision shows no malignancy** | Two options: (1) ***Surveillance*** with imaging + physical exam, or (2) ***Chemoprevention with tamoxifen*** [1] | Tamoxifen blocks ER → reduces oestrogen-driven proliferation → reduces risk of progression to invasive cancer |
| **Ongoing management** | ***Avoidance of OCP and HRT***; yearly mammography; twice-yearly breast exam; SERMs or aromatase inhibitors [1] | Remove exogenous oestrogen sources that fuel proliferation |

#### 3.2 DCIS and LCIS

Already covered in detail in the Classification section, but worth reiterating in the DDx context:

- ***DCIS: precursor to invasive ductal carcinoma (~1%/year). Mammographic microcalcifications. Manage with surgery ± RT ± endocrine therapy*** [2][3][7]
- ***LCIS: premalignant condition rather than true cancer*** [7][9] — a ***marker and precursor for bilateral invasive carcinoma (~1%/year)***. Usually an incidental finding. Classical LCIS → observation; pleomorphic LCIS → excision [2]

<Callout title="LCIS — A Premalignant Condition, NOT Cancer">
***Lobular carcinoma in-situ (LCIS) is really a premalignant condition rather than cancer*** [7][9]. Despite the name "carcinoma," classical LCIS is managed conservatively with observation because it is a **marker of increased bilateral risk** rather than a direct precursor at that specific site. This is fundamentally different from DCIS, which IS a direct precursor to ipsilateral IDC.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Differential Diagnosis of Breast Cancer">

1. **DDx of breast lump by age:** Young → fibroadenoma, cyst, fibrocystic changes. Old → carcinoma, Phyllodes tumour. Fat necrosis and lipoma at any age.

2. **Fibroadenoma** = most common benign tumour; "breast mouse" — highly mobile, rubbery, well-defined; hormonally dependent; simple type = no cancer risk.

3. **Phyllodes tumour** = fibroepithelial; can be malignant; metastasises via blood NOT lymphatics → ALND not required; excise with ≥ 1 cm margin.

4. **Fat necrosis** = mimics cancer clinically AND radiologically → core biopsy mandatory to differentiate.

5. **Nipple discharge:** Most common pathological cause = intraductal papilloma. Suspicious features: unilateral, single duct, bloody, spontaneous. Malignancy in 5–15% of pathological discharge (most commonly DCIS).

6. **Paget's disease** = unilateral nipple eczema + underlying cancer (~80%, usually HER2+). DDx from bilateral nipple eczema (dermatitis).

7. **IBC vs. mastitis:** IBC = peau d'orange ≥ 1/3 breast, erythema, NO fever/leukocytosis; Mastitis = fever + leukocytosis, responds to antibiotics.

8. **ADH/ALH** = high-risk lesions (4–5× risk); if found on core biopsy → MUST do excisional biopsy to rule out adjacent malignancy.

9. **LCIS** = premalignant condition, NOT true cancer; marker of bilateral risk; observe unless pleomorphic type.

10. **Triple assessment (clinical + radiological + pathological)** resolves virtually all diagnostic dilemmas.

Definitive diagnosis requires core biopsy showing foamy macrophages, giant cells, fibrosis, and fat necrosis with no malignant cells."
