## 1. Definition

Breast cancer is a malignant neoplasm arising from the epithelial cells lining the terminal duct-lobular unit (TDLU) of the breast. It encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases — from pre-invasive (in-situ) carcinomas confined within the basement membrane to invasive carcinomas that penetrate through the basement membrane into surrounding stroma and have metastatic potential.

Break down the terminology:

- "Carcinoma" = malignancy of **epithelial** origin (as opposed to sarcoma which is mesenchymal).
- "In situ" (Latin: "in place") = malignant cells that have not breached the basement membrane.
- "Invasive" = malignant cells have breached the basement membrane and can access lymphovascular spaces.

The TDLU is the functional unit of the breast — the site where milk is produced (lobule) and drained (terminal duct). This is the epicentre of almost all breast pathology, both benign and malignant.

## 2. Epidemiology

### 2.1 Global Epidemiology

- Breast cancer is the **most common malignancy in women worldwide** (surpassed lung cancer in 2020 per GLOBOCAN data) [1][2].
- Lifetime risk in Western countries: approximately **1 in 8** women.
- Higher incidence in Caucasians compared to Asians and Africans, though the gap is narrowing as Asian countries undergo epidemiological transition (Westernised diet, later childbearing, decreased breastfeeding) [1].
- **_Male-to-female ratio ≈ 1:100_** (some sources quote 1:2000 for overall population risk; the ratio of actual cases is ~1:100) [1][2].

  ***Women in Hong Kong tend to develop breast cancer at a younger age (around
  the 40s)*** compared to Western populations where the peak is in the 60s–70s.
  This has implications for screening (starting earlier) and imaging (younger
  women have denser breasts, making USG an important adjunct to mammography)

## 3. Anatomy & Function of the Breast

### 3.1 Surface Anatomy

The breast sits on the anterior chest wall overlying the pectoralis major (and partly serratus anterior), extending from the **2nd to 6th rib** vertically and from the **sternal edge to the mid-axillary line** horizontally. The **axillary tail of Spence** extends superolaterally towards the axilla — important clinically because tumours here can be mistaken for axillary lymphadenopathy.

### 3.2 Quadrants

The breast is divided into four quadrants by a vertical and horizontal line through the nipple:

| Quadrant                         | Proportion of breast tissue | Frequency of carcinoma           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **_Upper outer quadrant (UOQ)_** | Most breast tissue          | **_~60% of breast cancers_** [4] |
| Upper inner quadrant (UIQ)       | —                           | ~12%                             |
| Lower outer quadrant (LOQ)       | —                           | ~10%                             |
| Lower inner quadrant (LIQ)       | —                           | ~6%                              |
| Central / sub-areolar            | —                           | ~12%                             |

> **Why is the UOQ the most common site?** Simply because it contains the most glandular tissue (the bulk of the breast parenchyma is concentrated superolaterally, including the axillary tail).

### 3.3 Microanatomy — The Terminal Duct-Lobular Unit (TDLU)

The TDLU consists of:

- **Lobules (acini)** — milk-producing glandular units
- **Terminal ducts** — drain each lobule
- **Lactiferous ducts** — converge towards the nipple (15–20 per breast), each draining a lobe
- **Lactiferous sinuses** — dilated segments just behind the nipple that store milk

Two cell layers line the ducts and lobules:

1. **Inner luminal epithelial cells** — secrete milk; give rise to most carcinomas
2. **Outer myoepithelial cells** — contractile cells that squeeze milk out; sit on the **basement membrane**

> The key distinction between in-situ and invasive carcinoma is whether the malignant cells have breached through the myoepithelial cell layer and basement membrane.

### 3.4 Lymphatic Drainage

Understanding lymphatic drainage is critical for staging and surgical planning:

| Drainage route                           | Breast region drained                                     | Clinical relevance                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Axillary lymph nodes** (Levels I–III)  | Lateral tumours (outer quadrant) and central lesions      | Most common route of regional spread; Level I = lateral to pectoralis minor, Level II = behind pec minor, Level III = medial to pec minor (infraclavicular) |
| **Internal mammary (parasternal) nodes** | Medial tumours (inner quadrant) and central lesions       | Along internal thoracic artery; less accessible surgically                                                                                                  |
| **Supraclavicular nodes**                | Secondary spread from axillary or internal mammary chains | Involvement = N3c = Stage IIIC (advanced disease)                                                                                                           |
| **Interpectoral (Rotter's) nodes**       | Between pectoralis major and minor                        | Removed during Level II axillary dissection                                                                                                                 |

> **_Lateral tumours in the outer quadrant and centrally located lesions drain primarily to axillary lymph nodes. Upper and lower inner quadrant tumours drain to internal mammary lymph nodes._** [1]

**Sentinel lymph node (SLN):** The **_first lymph node to which cancer cells are most likely to spread from a primary tumour_**, usually the node closest to the tumour. A negative SLN biopsy indicates that cancer has likely not spread to regional lymph nodes, and full axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be avoided — **_sparing the patient morbidity from lymphoedema_** [1].

### 3.5 Blood Supply

- **Arterial:** Internal thoracic artery (perforating branches), lateral thoracic artery, thoraco-acromial artery, posterior intercostal arteries
- **Venous:** Corresponding veins — importantly, the **vertebral venous plexus (Batson's plexus)** provides a valve-less route for haematogenous metastasis to the **spine and pelvis** (explaining why bone is the most common site of distant metastasis)

### 3.6 Hormonal Regulation

The breast is an endocrine target organ:

- **Oestrogen** → stimulates ductal proliferation
- **Progesterone** → stimulates lobular/alveolar development
- **Prolactin** → stimulates milk production
- **Oxytocin** → stimulates myoepithelial contraction (milk let-down)

This hormonal dependence is fundamental to understanding both the aetiology (prolonged oestrogen exposure → increased risk) and treatment (anti-oestrogen therapy) of breast cancer.

## 4. Etiology & Risk Factors

Think of breast cancer risk factors in a structured framework: **Demographics → Genetics → Hormonal (endogenous & exogenous) → Medical history → Lifestyle → Radiation**.

### 4.1 Demographics

| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Age**       | Risk increases with age; most cases diagnosed > 50 | Accumulation of somatic mutations over time                    |
| **Sex**       | **_Female >> Male (M:F ≈ 1:100)_** [2]             | Oestrogen-driven proliferation of breast epithelium in females |
| **Ethnicity** | Higher in Caucasians; increasing in Asians         | Genetic and lifestyle factors                                  |

### 4.2 Genetic / Hereditary Risk Factors (~10% of breast cancers)

#### 4.2.1 BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutations

**_BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most common hereditary breast cancer genes_** [5][6].

- **Mode of inheritance:** **_Autosomal dominant_** with variable penetrance [1]
- **Normal function:** Both are **tumour suppressor genes** involved in **homologous recombination DNA repair** (specifically, repair of double-strand DNA breaks)
- **Pathophysiology ("two-hit hypothesis"):**
  - First hit = **germline mutation** (inherited, present in all cells)
  - Second hit = **somatic mutation** or loss of the remaining normal allele
  - When both alleles are knocked out → loss of DNA repair capacity → genomic instability → accumulation of further mutations → malignant transformation [1]

<Callout title="BRCA Mutation Carrier Characteristics" type="idea">
***Suspect BRCA mutation when you see*** [1]:

- **Male breast cancer** (especially BRCA2)
- **Triple-negative** breast cancer
</Callout>

**_Management of BRCA carriers: prophylactic bilateral mastectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), and PARP1 inhibitors_** (e.g., olaparib — PARP inhibitors exploit "synthetic lethality" in BRCA-mutant cells that are already deficient in homologous recombination; blocking the remaining DNA repair pathway [PARP-mediated base excision repair] forces the cell into apoptosis) [2].

### 4.3 Hormonal Risk Factors

The overarching principle: **_prolonged and/or increased exposure to oestrogen drives proliferation of breast epithelial cells_**, increasing the chance of acquiring somatic mutations and developing hormone receptor-positive breast cancer [1][5].

#### 4.3.1 Endogenous Oestrogen

| Factor                                                                 | Why it increases risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **_Nulliparity_** [5]                                                  | No interruption of menstrual cycling by pregnancy; no terminal differentiation of breast lobules                                                                                                                                        |
| **_No breastfeeding_** [1]                                             | Breastfeeding suppresses ovulation (via prolactin-mediated inhibition of GnRH) → reduces cumulative oestrogen exposure; also promotes terminal differentiation of lobular cells, making them more resistant to malignant transformation |
| **_Late age of first pregnancy ( > 30)_** [5]                          | Undifferentiated breast tissue exposed to oestrogen for longer before first full-term pregnancy induces terminal differentiation                                                                                                        |
| **_Oestrogen-secreting ovarian tumour_** (e.g., granulosa cell tumour) | Direct exogenous oestrogen production                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

> **Key concept:** A full-term pregnancy before age 30 is protective because it induces terminal differentiation of breast lobular cells (Type 3 → Type 4 lobules), which are more genetically stable and less susceptible to carcinogenic transformation. Nulliparity or late first pregnancy means the breast retains immature, undifferentiated Type 1 and Type 2 lobules for longer — these are the cells most vulnerable to malignant change.

#### 4.3.2 Exogenous Oestrogen

| **_Combined oral contraceptive pills (COC)_** [3][5] | Small increase in risk during use and shortly after; risk returns to baseline ~10 years after cessation                                                                            |
| **_Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)_** [3][5]       | Combined oestrogen-progestogen HRT increases risk; risk increases with duration of use; oestrogen-only HRT (in post-hysterectomy women) has a smaller or negligible increased risk |

### 4.4 Obesity & Metabolic Factors

**_Obesity risk depends on menopausal status_** [1]:

| Menopausal status   | Effect of obesity    | Mechanism                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pre-menopausal**  | **_Decreased risk_** | Obesity causes anovulation → less cyclic oestrogen peaks (oestrogen synthesis is primarily ovarian in pre-menopausal women)                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Post-menopausal** | **_Increased risk_** | After menopause, the ovaries cease oestrogen production. The primary source of oestrogen becomes **peripheral adipose tissue** via the **aromatase enzyme** (converts adrenal androgens to oestrone). More adipose tissue → more aromatase → more oestrogen → increased breast cancer risk |

This is also why **aromatase inhibitors** (e.g., anastrozole, letrozole) are used as treatment in **post-menopausal** ER+ breast cancer — they block this peripheral conversion.

**_Physical inactivity_** also increases risk, likely through obesity-related and insulin resistance mechanisms [5][3].

### 4.6 Lifestyle Factors

| Factor            | Mechanism                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **_Smoking_** [5] | Carcinogens in tobacco smoke (aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) can form DNA adducts in breast tissue; also anti-oestrogenic effects may partly counterbalance this — net effect is a modest increase in risk |
| **_Alcohol_** [1] | Increases circulating oestrogen levels, generates acetaldehyde (a carcinogen), impairs folate metabolism (needed for DNA methylation and repair)                                                                               |
| **_Diet_** [5]    | High-fat, Westernised diets associated with higher risk (likely mediated through obesity)                                                                                                                                      |

### 4.7 Radiation Exposure

**_Exposure to therapeutic ionising radiation_** — particularly chest/mediastinal radiation at a young age (e.g., mantle radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma) — significantly increases breast cancer risk. The younger the age at exposure, the higher the risk (developing breast tissue is more radiosensitive) [1][5].

## 5. Pathophysiology — Multi-Step Carcinogenesis

Breast cancer arises through a **stepwise progression** of genetic and epigenetic alterations:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Normal Epithelium"] --> B["Usual Hyperplasia"]
    B --> C["Atypical Hyperplasia\n(ADH/ALH)"]
    C --> D["Carcinoma In Situ\n(DCIS/LCIS)"]
    D --> E["Invasive Carcinoma"]
    E --> F["Metastatic Disease"]
```

### Key Steps:

1. **Initiation:** A genetic insult (inherited or acquired) causes a mutation in a proto-oncogene or tumour suppressor gene (e.g., TP53, PIK3CA, BRCA1/2 loss, HER2 amplification)
2. **Promotion:** Hormonal stimulation (especially oestrogen) drives proliferation of initiated cells, expanding the clone
3. **Progression:** Additional mutations accumulate (loss of cell cycle control, angiogenesis activation, evasion of apoptosis) → in-situ carcinoma
4. **Invasion:** Disruption of the basement membrane (loss of myoepithelial cell integrity, upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases) → invasive carcinoma
5. **Metastasis:** Invasion of lymphovascular spaces → lymphatic spread (regional LN) and haematogenous spread (distant organs)

### Modes of Spread [1]

| Mode                     | Details                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Direct spread**        | Into chest wall (pectoralis, intercostal muscles, ribs), skin and subcutaneous tissues |
| **Lymphatic spread**     | Axillary LN (most common), internal mammary LN, supraclavicular LN                     |
| **Haematogenous spread** | **_Bone > Liver > Lung > Brain > Ovaries > Adrenals > Pleura_** [1][2]                 |

> **Why is bone the most common site of distant metastasis?** Breast cancer cells have tropism for the bone marrow microenvironment — they express CXCR4 (chemokine receptor) that binds to CXCL12 (SDF-1) produced by bone marrow stromal cells. Additionally, the **vertebral venous plexus (Batson's plexus)** provides a direct, valveless venous route from the breast/thoracic wall to the vertebral column.

## 6. Classification

### 6.1 Histological Classification

**_Breast cancers_** are broadly classified into **_in-situ carcinoma_** and **_invasive carcinoma_** [5][7]:

<Callout title="Why SLNB with Mastectomy for DCIS?" type="error">
  A common point of confusion: "If DCIS is non-invasive, why do SLNB?" The
  answer is that mastectomy destroys the lymphatic drainage patterns of the
  breast. If the final mastectomy specimen reveals an occult invasive focus
  (which occurs in **10–20% of cases**), you can no longer perform an accurate
  SLNB afterwards. So you do it at the time of mastectomy as a "safety net." [2]

#### 6.1.3 Special Types

**Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC)** [1]:

**_By definition T4d in TNM staging._** A rare, aggressive form that **_resembles mastitis clinically and radiologically_** but is **_NOT a true inflammatory process_**.

The mechanism: tumour cells invade and obstruct the **_dermal lymphatic channels_** of the breast → lymphatic obstruction → oedema of overlying skin → **_peau d'orange_** (skin resembling an orange peel due to tethering at the sites of sweat gland/hair follicle openings while surrounding skin is oedematous).

**_Diagnostic criteria_** [1]:

1. Rapid onset of breast **_erythema, oedema, peau d'orange, or warm breast_** ± underlying palpable mass
2. **_Erythema occupying at least 1/3 of the breast_**
3. **_Duration of history no more than 6 months_**
4. **_Pathological confirmation of invasive carcinoma_**

> **Key distinguishing point:** Mastitis → associated with **_fever and leukocytosis_**; IBC is **_NOT_** associated with these (it is not a true infection/inflammation) [1].

**Paget's Disease of the Nipple** [1]:

- "Paget" cells = malignant intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells migrating from an underlying carcinoma into the epidermis of the nipple
- Characterised by **_eczematoid changes and ulcerated lesions of the nipple-areolar complex_**
- **_Almost ALWAYS (~80%) associated with an underlying breast cancer, which is typically HER2-positive_** [1]
- Presents with **_pain, burning, pruritus, palpable breast mass, bloody nipple discharge, or nipple inversion_**
- Diagnosis: **_full-thickness wedge biopsy of the nipple_** showing Paget cells
- Treatment: **_excision of the underlying cancer + nipple-areolar complex_** (mastectomy or BCT + whole-breast irradiation) [1]

### 6.2 Molecular Subtypes (St Gallen IHC Classification)

This is a **clinically crucial** classification because it determines treatment strategy [1][2]:

| **_Subtype_**                      | **_IHC Definition_**      | **_Frequency_** | **_Treatment_**                                                                                                                                                       | **_Prognosis_**      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **_Luminal A_**                    | **_HR+/HER2−/Ki67 low_**  | ~40%            | **_Endocrine therapy alone_** (± cytotoxics if high nodal burden) [2]                                                                                                 | **_Best prognosis_** |
| **_Luminal B (HER2−)_**            | **_HR+/HER2−/Ki67 high_** | ~20%            | **_Endocrine therapy ± cytotoxic therapy_** [2]                                                                                                                       | Intermediate         |
| **_Luminal B (HER2+)_**            | **_HR+/HER2+_**           | ~10%            | **_Cytotoxics + anti-HER2 + hormonal therapy_** [2]                                                                                                                   | Intermediate         |
| **_HER2-positive (non-luminal)_**  | **_HR−/HER2+_**           | **_~15%_** [1]  | **_Cytotoxics + anti-HER2 therapy (e.g., trastuzumab); NO response to hormonal treatment_** [1]                                                                       | **_Poor prognosis_** |
| **_Triple-negative (basal-like)_** | **_HR−/HER2−_**           | **_~15%_** [1]  | **_Cytotoxic therapy (platinum-based); PARP inhibitors if BRCA-mutant; immunotherapy (pembrolizumab if PD-L1+); NO response to Herceptin or hormonal treatment_** [1] | **_Poor prognosis_** |

<Callout title="Understanding the Molecular Subtypes">

**Why do these subtypes matter?** They dictate which therapeutic "weapons" you can use:

- **ER/PR+** → You can use **endocrine therapy** (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors) because the tumour depends on oestrogen for growth.
- **HER2+** → You can use **anti-HER2 therapy** (trastuzumab/Herceptin, pertuzumab) because the tumour overexpresses HER2 receptors driving proliferation.
- **Triple-negative** → You have **no targeted receptor to exploit** → relies on **cytotoxic chemotherapy**, though PARP inhibitors are now available for BRCA-mutant cases and immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab) for PD-L1+ tumours.

**Ki67** is a nuclear antigen that marks proliferating cells. **High Ki67** = more aggressive, faster-growing tumour = more likely to respond to chemotherapy (because chemo targets rapidly dividing cells) but also carries a worse prognosis.

</Callout>

**Key receptors explained:**

- **ER (Oestrogen Receptor):** A nuclear transcription factor. When oestrogen binds → activates gene transcription promoting cell proliferation. Tamoxifen is a **selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM)** that competitively blocks oestrogen binding.
- **PR (Progesterone Receptor):** Expression is oestrogen-driven; PR+ confirms a functioning ER pathway. PR+ tumours have even better prognosis among HR+ cancers.
- **HER2 (Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2):** A transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor (ErbB2/neu). Amplification → constitutive activation of downstream RAS-MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways → uncontrolled proliferation. Trastuzumab ("Herceptin") is a monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular domain of HER2, blocking signalling and marking the cell for immune-mediated destruction (ADCC).

### 6.3 TNM Staging (AJCC 8th Edition, 2017)

The TNM staging system classifies breast cancer based on:

**T — Primary Tumour:**

| Stage | Description                                                                                                                                        |

| T3    | > 5 cm                                                                                                                                             |
| T4    | Any size with direct extension to chest wall (T4a), skin oedema/ulceration/satellite nodules (T4b), both (T4c), **_inflammatory carcinoma (T4d)_** |

**N — Regional Lymph Nodes:**

| Stage | Description                                                                                                                  |

| N1    | Movable ipsilateral axillary LN (Level I–II)                                                                                 |
| N2    | Fixed/matted ipsilateral axillary LN (N2a) or ipsilateral internal mammary LN without axillary LN involvement (N2b)          |
| N3    | Ipsilateral infraclavicular LN (N3a), ipsilateral internal mammary + axillary LN (N3b), ipsilateral supraclavicular LN (N3c) |

**M — Distant Metastasis:**

| Stage | Description                                                             |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| M0    | No distant metastasis                                                   |
| M1    | Distant metastasis present (including contralateral supraclavicular LN) |

**Stage Grouping:**

| Stage     | TNM                          | 5-Year Survival (HK) |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Stage I   | T1 N0 M0                     | **_97.5%_** [1]      |

## 7. Clinical Features

### 7.1 Symptoms

| Symptom                                                                       | Pathophysiological Basis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Painless breast lump_** (most common presenting complaint)                 | Malignant proliferation forms a mass; breast cancers are typically painless because they grow insidiously without stretching the breast capsule rapidly (unlike infection/inflammation). Pain can occur with larger tumours or inflammatory type                                                                                  |
| **_Nipple discharge_** (especially **_unilateral, single-duct, bloody_**) [2] | Tumour eroding into or arising from a duct → disrupts duct lining → bloody discharge. Serous/serosanguinous discharge may also occur. The high-risk features (**_unilateral, single duct, bloody_**) point towards an intraductal lesion (either papilloma or DCIS/invasive cancer) rather than bilateral physiological discharge |
| **_Nipple retraction/inversion_** (new onset)                                 | Tumour invading and fibrosis of the **_subareolar lactiferous ducts_** → tethering and retraction of the nipple. Must distinguish from **longstanding congenital inversion** (benign)                                                                                                                                             |
| **_Skin changes — peau d'orange_**                                            | Tumour cells block **_dermal lymphatic channels_** → lymphatic oedema of the skin → skin pits at sweat gland/hair follicle openings (which are tethered by Cooper's ligaments), creating the "orange peel" appearance                                                                                                             |
| **_Skin dimpling / tethering_**                                               | Tumour invades or causes fibrotic reaction in **_Cooper's ligaments_** (suspensory ligaments that connect the breast parenchyma to the skin and chest wall) → shortening of these ligaments → dimpling of overlying skin, especially on raising arms                                                                              |

#### 7.2.2 Palpation of Breast

A malignant breast mass classically has the following characteristics [1][2]:

| Feature         | Malignant (Breast Cancer)                                                                                  | Benign (e.g., Fibroadenoma)    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Consistency** | **_Hard_** (desmoplastic stromal reaction around tumour)                                                   | Rubbery/firm                   |
| **Border**      | **_Irregular, ill-defined_** (infiltrative growth pattern)                                                 | Well-defined, smooth           |
| **Surface**     | **_Irregular_**                                                                                            | Smooth                         |
| **Tenderness**  | **_Usually non-tender_**                                                                                   | Non-tender or mildly tender    |
| **Mobility**    | **_Fixed to skin or underlying muscle_** (late sign — tumour invades Cooper's ligaments/pectoralis fascia) | Highly mobile ("breast mouse") |
| **Site**        | **_Most commonly upper outer quadrant (~60%)_** [4]                                                        | Any quadrant                   |

> **Testing fixation:**
>
> - **Skin fixation:** Pinch the skin over the mass — if the mass is fixed to skin, the skin will dimple/pucker
> - **Chest wall/muscle fixation:** Ask the patient to press hands on hips (contracts pectoralis major) — if the mass is fixed to the muscle, it becomes less mobile with contraction

#### 7.2.3 Palpation of Axilla

**_The axillary lymph nodes are examined in five groups_** [2]:

1. **Anterior (pectoral)** — along the lateral border of pectoralis major
2. **Posterior (subscapular)** — along the lateral border of the scapula
3. **Medial (central)** — high up against the chest wall
4. **Lateral (humeral)** — along the medial aspect of the humerus
5. **Apical** — at the apex of the axilla

Comment on: **_number, site, size, consistency, tenderness, fixation_** [2].

Involved nodes feel **hard, non-tender, matted (fixed to each other), or fixed to adjacent structures**. Also examine the **supraclavicular fossa** and **infraclavicular region** for lymphadenopathy.

#### 7.2.4 Signs of Metastatic Disease

| Site            | Signs to elicit                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bone**        | Bony tenderness (spine, pelvis, long bones), pathological fractures |
| **Liver**       | Hepatomegaly, jaundice, ascites                                     |
| **Lung/Pleura** | Decreased breath sounds (effusion), crackles                        |
| **Brain**       | Focal neurological deficits, signs of raised ICP                    |

### 7.3 Multifocal vs. Multicentric Disease [2]

| Term               | Definition                                                 | Implication for Surgery                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Multifocal_**   | ≥ 2 foci within a limited area (usually **same quadrant**) | **_Not a contraindication to breast-conserving therapy (BCT)_** |
| **_Multicentric_** | ≥ 2 foci in **different quadrants**                        | **_Contraindication to BCT_** → mastectomy required             |

## 8. Screening

### 8.1 HK Cancer Expert Working Group (CEWG) Recommendations [3]

**_For average-risk women:_**

- **_Women aged 44–69_** with **_certain combinations of personalised risk factors_** (including **_first-degree relative with breast cancer, prior benign breast disease, nulliparity, late first live birth, early menarche, high BMI, and physical inactivity_**):
  - **_Recommended to consider mammography screening every two years_**
  - **_Should discuss with doctors about potential benefits and harms_**

### 8.2 Practical HK Screening Approach [1][3][4]

| Age                                                        | Recommendation                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **_All ages_**                                             | **_Monthly breast self-examination_**          |
| **_≥ 40 years_** (earlier if high risk e.g., FHx positive) | **_Annual mammogram + USG_**                   |
| Age 30 (ACS guidelines)                                    | Yearly breast examination by doctor            |
| Age 40 (ACS)                                               | Mammogram every 2 years + yearly clinical exam |
| Age 50 (ACS)                                               | Annual mammogram + yearly clinical exam        |

<Callout title="Why USG in HK Screening?" type="idea">
  ***USG should be considered as part of screening apart from mammography***
  because ***younger Asian women have denser breasts***, which reduces
  mammographic sensitivity (dense tissue appears white on mammogram, as does
  cancer — the "finding a snowball in a snowstorm" problem). USG can detect
  lesions within dense tissue that mammography misses [1][3].
</Callout>

### 8.3 Genetic Testing & Counselling [1]

**_Criteria for referral for genetic counselling_** [1]:

- **Personal history:**
  - Breast cancer diagnosed at age **_≤ 50_**
  - **_Triple-negative breast cancer_**
  - **_Male breast cancer (BRCA2)_**
- **Family history:**
  - **_≥ 2 relatives with breast cancer, one diagnosed at age ≤ 50_**
  - **_≥ 3 relatives with breast cancer at any age_**
  - **_Previous identified BRCA1/2 mutation in family_**

**_Principles of genetic testing_** [1]:

1. **_Always test the AFFECTED individual first_**
2. **_Only if a mutation is identified_**, then test unaffected family members
3. **_NEVER test an unaffected individual first_** — because a negative result from a family where no mutation has been identified is **uninformative** (other predisposition genes may exist that haven't been identified yet)

## 10. Important History-Taking Framework

When assessing a patient with a breast complaint, use this systematic framework [2][3]:

**_Important questions in history-taking (must know!)_** [2]:

1. **Mass:** Onset & progression, any cyclical changes / mastalgia
2. **Nipple:** Discharge / retraction
3. **Skin:** Itchiness, erythema, dimpling / peau d'orange
4. **Constitutional symptoms:** Weight loss, bone pain, SOB
5. **Risk factors of malignancy:**
   - **_Family history:_** BRCA — any CA breast / ovary / prostate / pancreas [3]
   - **_Past medical history:_** Prior breast disease (e.g., DCIS), prior breast/chest RT [3]
   - **_Oestrogen exposure:_** Age of menarche, age of menopause, parity, breastfeeding, use of COC/HRT [3]
   - **_First/second degree relative (age of onset)_** [3]
   - **_Hormonal risk: menarche/menopause_** [3]
   - **_Gestational history_** [3]
   - **_Breastfeeding history_** [3]
   - **_Previous breast screening (if any)_** [3]

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Breast Cancer — Key Points:**

1. **Definition:** Malignant neoplasm of breast epithelium (TDLU). In-situ vs. invasive depends on basement membrane breach.

2. **Epidemiology (HK):** 1st most common cancer in females, 3rd overall; median age ~55 (younger than West); lifetime risk 1:16.

3. **Risk Factors — "Oestrogen Exposure" is the unifying theme:** Early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, no breastfeeding, late first pregnancy, COC/HRT, obesity (post-menopausal).

4. **Genetics:** BRCA1/2 (autosomal dominant tumour suppressor genes for DNA repair); Li-Fraumeni (TP53); Cowden (PTEN); CDH1 → lobular cancer.

5. **BRCA1:** ~65% breast cancer risk by 70, ~39% ovarian; associated with triple-negative subtype. **BRCA2:** ~45% breast cancer risk by 70, ~11% ovarian; associated with male breast cancer (~6%).

6. **Pathology:** IDC NOS (80%) > ILC (3–8%) > Special types. DCIS = precursor to IDC; LCIS = marker/precursor for bilateral invasive cancer.

7. **Molecular Subtypes:** Luminal A (best prognosis, endocrine therapy), Luminal B, HER2+ (anti-HER2 therapy), Triple-negative (worst prognosis, chemo/PARP/immunotherapy).

8. **Clinical Features:** Hard, irregular, fixed, non-tender mass in UOQ; nipple discharge (unilateral, bloody, single duct = high risk); peau d'orange (dermal lymphatic obstruction); skin dimpling (Cooper's ligament invasion); nipple retraction (duct fibrosis/invasion).

9. **Paget's Disease:** Eczematoid nipple change + underlying breast cancer (usually HER2+). IBC: T4d, peau d'orange ≥ 1/3 breast, < 6 months history, NOT true infection.

10. **Screening (HK):** Monthly self-exam all ages; mammogram + USG annually from age 40 (earlier if high risk); CEWG recommends biennial mammography for average-risk women aged 44–69 with risk factors.

11. **Genetic Testing:** Test affected individual first → only test unaffected relatives if mutation found.
