# Breast Cancer — Definition, Epidemiology, Risk Factors, Anatomy, Etiology, Pathophysiology, Classification & Clinical Features

---

## 1. Definition

Breast cancer is a malignant neoplasm arising from the epithelial cells lining the terminal duct-lobular unit (TDLU) of the breast. It encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases — from pre-invasive (in-situ) carcinomas confined within the basement membrane to invasive carcinomas that penetrate through the basement membrane into surrounding stroma and have metastatic potential.

Break down the terminology:
- "Carcinoma" = malignancy of **epithelial** origin (as opposed to sarcoma which is mesenchymal).
- "In situ" (Latin: "in place") = malignant cells that have not breached the basement membrane.
- "Invasive" = malignant cells have breached the basement membrane and can access lymphovascular spaces.

The TDLU is the functional unit of the breast — the site where milk is produced (lobule) and drained (terminal duct). This is the epicentre of almost all breast pathology, both benign and malignant.

## 2. Epidemiology

### 2.1 Global Epidemiology

- Breast cancer is the **most common malignancy in women worldwide** (surpassed lung cancer in 2020 per GLOBOCAN data) [1][2].
- Lifetime risk in Western countries: approximately **1 in 8** women.
- Higher incidence in Caucasians compared to Asians and Africans, though the gap is narrowing as Asian countries undergo epidemiological transition (Westernised diet, later childbearing, decreased breastfeeding) [1].
- ***Male-to-female ratio ≈ 1:100*** (some sources quote 1:2000 for overall population risk; the ratio of actual cases is ~1:100) [1][2].

### 2.2 Hong Kong Epidemiology

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Incidence in females** | ***1st most common cancer in females*** [1][2] |
| **Overall incidence (both sexes)** | ***3rd most common cancer*** [1] |
| **Mortality in females** | ***3rd most common cause of cancer death*** [1] |
| **Median age at diagnosis** | ***~55 years (younger than Western data — peak in 40s–50s in HK)*** [2] |
| **Lifetime risk (HK)** | ***~1 in 16*** [2] |
| Trend | Incidence rising steadily; attributed to Westernised lifestyle, later childbearing, reduced breastfeeding, and increased mammographic detection |

<Callout title="HK-Specific Point" type="idea">
***Women in Hong Kong tend to develop breast cancer at a younger age (around the 40s)*** compared to Western populations where the peak is in the 60s–70s. This has implications for screening (starting earlier) and imaging (younger women have denser breasts, making USG an important adjunct to mammography) [1][3].
</Callout>

## 3. Anatomy & Function of the Breast

### 3.1 Surface Anatomy

The breast sits on the anterior chest wall overlying the pectoralis major (and partly serratus anterior), extending from the **2nd to 6th rib** vertically and from the **sternal edge to the mid-axillary line** horizontally. The **axillary tail of Spence** extends superolaterally towards the axilla — important clinically because tumours here can be mistaken for axillary lymphadenopathy.

### 3.2 Quadrants

The breast is divided into four quadrants by a vertical and horizontal line through the nipple:

| Quadrant | Proportion of breast tissue | Frequency of carcinoma |
|---|---|---|
| ***Upper outer quadrant (UOQ)*** | Most breast tissue | ***~60% of breast cancers*** [4] |
| Upper inner quadrant (UIQ) | — | ~12% |
| Lower outer quadrant (LOQ) | — | ~10% |
| Lower inner quadrant (LIQ) | — | ~6% |
| Central / sub-areolar | — | ~12% |

> **Why is the UOQ the most common site?** Simply because it contains the most glandular tissue (the bulk of the breast parenchyma is concentrated superolaterally, including the axillary tail).

### 3.3 Microanatomy — The Terminal Duct-Lobular Unit (TDLU)

The TDLU consists of:
- **Lobules (acini)** — milk-producing glandular units
- **Terminal ducts** — drain each lobule
- **Lactiferous ducts** — converge towards the nipple (15–20 per breast), each draining a lobe
- **Lactiferous sinuses** — dilated segments just behind the nipple that store milk

Two cell layers line the ducts and lobules:
1. **Inner luminal epithelial cells** — secrete milk; give rise to most carcinomas
2. **Outer myoepithelial cells** — contractile cells that squeeze milk out; sit on the **basement membrane**

> The key distinction between in-situ and invasive carcinoma is whether the malignant cells have breached through the myoepithelial cell layer and basement membrane.

### 3.4 Lymphatic Drainage

Understanding lymphatic drainage is critical for staging and surgical planning:

<DiagramCard src="/diagrams/axillary-levels.jpeg" alt="Axillary lymph node levels I, II, and III in relation to pectoralis minor" caption="Axillary lymph node levels (I-III) [8]" />

| Drainage route | Breast region drained | Clinical relevance |
|---|---|---|
| **Axillary lymph nodes** (Levels I–III) | Lateral tumours (outer quadrant) and central lesions | Most common route of regional spread; Level I = lateral to pectoralis minor, Level II = behind pec minor, Level III = medial to pec minor (infraclavicular) |
| **Internal mammary (parasternal) nodes** | Medial tumours (inner quadrant) and central lesions | Along internal thoracic artery; less accessible surgically |
| **Supraclavicular nodes** | Secondary spread from axillary or internal mammary chains | Involvement = N3c = Stage IIIC (advanced disease) |
| **Interpectoral (Rotter's) nodes** | Between pectoralis major and minor | Removed during Level II axillary dissection |

> ***Lateral tumours in the outer quadrant and centrally located lesions drain primarily to axillary lymph nodes. Upper and lower inner quadrant tumours drain to internal mammary lymph nodes.*** [1]

**Sentinel lymph node (SLN):** The ***first lymph node to which cancer cells are most likely to spread from a primary tumour***, usually the node closest to the tumour. A negative SLN biopsy indicates that cancer has likely not spread to regional lymph nodes, and full axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be avoided — ***sparing the patient morbidity from lymphoedema*** [1].

### 3.5 Blood Supply

- **Arterial:** Internal thoracic artery (perforating branches), lateral thoracic artery, thoraco-acromial artery, posterior intercostal arteries
- **Venous:** Corresponding veins — importantly, the **vertebral venous plexus (Batson's plexus)** provides a valve-less route for haematogenous metastasis to the **spine and pelvis** (explaining why bone is the most common site of distant metastasis)

### 3.6 Hormonal Regulation

The breast is an endocrine target organ:
- **Oestrogen** → stimulates ductal proliferation
- **Progesterone** → stimulates lobular/alveolar development
- **Prolactin** → stimulates milk production
- **Oxytocin** → stimulates myoepithelial contraction (milk let-down)

This hormonal dependence is fundamental to understanding both the aetiology (prolonged oestrogen exposure → increased risk) and treatment (anti-oestrogen therapy) of breast cancer.

## 4. Etiology & Risk Factors

Think of breast cancer risk factors in a structured framework: **Demographics → Genetics → Hormonal (endogenous & exogenous) → Medical history → Lifestyle → Radiation**.

### 4.1 Demographics

| Factor | Detail | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Age** | Risk increases with age; most cases diagnosed > 50 | Accumulation of somatic mutations over time |
| **Sex** | ***Female >> Male (M:F ≈ 1:100)*** [2] | Oestrogen-driven proliferation of breast epithelium in females |
| **Ethnicity** | Higher in Caucasians; increasing in Asians | Genetic and lifestyle factors |

### 4.2 Genetic / Hereditary Risk Factors (~10% of breast cancers)

#### 4.2.1 BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutations

***BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most common hereditary breast cancer genes*** [5][6].

- **Mode of inheritance:** ***Autosomal dominant*** with variable penetrance [1]
- **Normal function:** Both are **tumour suppressor genes** involved in **homologous recombination DNA repair** (specifically, repair of double-strand DNA breaks)
- **Pathophysiology ("two-hit hypothesis"):**
  - First hit = **germline mutation** (inherited, present in all cells)
  - Second hit = **somatic mutation** or loss of the remaining normal allele
  - When both alleles are knocked out → loss of DNA repair capacity → genomic instability → accumulation of further mutations → malignant transformation [1]

| | ***BRCA1*** | ***BRCA2*** |
|---|---|---|
| Chromosome | 17q21 | 13q12 |
| ***Breast cancer risk by age 70*** | ***~65% (51–75%)*** [5] | ***~45% (33–54%)*** [6] |
| ***Second primary breast cancer*** | ***~40–60% lifetime*** [5] | High (lower than BRCA1) |
| ***Ovarian cancer risk*** | ***~39% (22–51%)*** [5] | ***~11% (4–18%)*** [6] |
| ***Male breast cancer*** | Uncommon | ***~6% lifetime risk*** [6] |
| Prostate cancer | ***Increased risk*** [5] | ***Increased risk (~1.5–3 fold)*** [6] |
| Pancreatic cancer | Possible | ***Increased risk (~1.5–3 fold)*** [6] |
| Other associated cancers | ***Colon*** [5], fallopian tube, peritoneum | ***Laryngeal, bile duct, stomach, colon (minimal), melanoma*** [6] |
| Typical molecular subtype | ***Triple-negative (basal-like)*** [2] | ER+/HER2– more common |

<Callout title="BRCA Mutation Carrier Characteristics" type="idea">
***Suspect BRCA mutation when you see*** [1]:
- Breast cancer diagnosed at **early age** (< 50)
- History of **both breast and ovarian cancer** in the same patient
- **Family cases** of breast and ovarian cancer
- **Bilateral** breast cancer
- **Male breast cancer** (especially BRCA2)
- **Triple-negative** breast cancer
</Callout>

***Management of BRCA carriers: prophylactic bilateral mastectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), and PARP1 inhibitors*** (e.g., olaparib — PARP inhibitors exploit "synthetic lethality" in BRCA-mutant cells that are already deficient in homologous recombination; blocking the remaining DNA repair pathway [PARP-mediated base excision repair] forces the cell into apoptosis) [2].

#### 4.2.2 Other Genetic Syndromes

| Syndrome | Gene | Mechanism | Associated cancers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Li-Fraumeni syndrome** | ***TP53 germline mutation*** | p53 is the "guardian of the genome" — loss leads to failure of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage | Breast cancer, sarcoma, brain tumours, adrenocortical cancer, leukaemia [1][2] |
| **Cowden syndrome** | ***PTEN mutation*** | PTEN is a phosphatase that negatively regulates PI3K/Akt pathway; loss → uncontrolled cell growth | Breast, thyroid, endometrial cancer; multiple hamartomas [2] |
| **Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer** | ***CDH1 (E-cadherin) gene mutation*** | Loss of cell–cell adhesion → predisposition to diffuse (signet ring) gastric cancer and **lobular** breast cancer | Diffuse gastric cancer, lobular breast cancer [1] |
| **Peutz-Jeghers syndrome** | ***STK11/LKB1 mutation*** | Tumour suppressor involved in cell polarity and energy sensing (AMPK pathway) | GI hamartomatous polyps, breast, ovary, pancreas [2] |

### 4.3 Hormonal Risk Factors

The overarching principle: ***prolonged and/or increased exposure to oestrogen drives proliferation of breast epithelial cells***, increasing the chance of acquiring somatic mutations and developing hormone receptor-positive breast cancer [1][5].

#### 4.3.1 Endogenous Oestrogen

| Factor | Why it increases risk |
|---|---|
| ***Early menarche ( < 12 years)*** [5] | Longer duration of cyclic oestrogen exposure |
| ***Late menopause ( > 55 years)*** [5] | Same — more ovulatory cycles |
| ***Nulliparity*** [5] | No interruption of menstrual cycling by pregnancy; no terminal differentiation of breast lobules |
| ***No breastfeeding*** [1] | Breastfeeding suppresses ovulation (via prolactin-mediated inhibition of GnRH) → reduces cumulative oestrogen exposure; also promotes terminal differentiation of lobular cells, making them more resistant to malignant transformation |
| ***Late age of first pregnancy ( > 30)*** [5] | Undifferentiated breast tissue exposed to oestrogen for longer before first full-term pregnancy induces terminal differentiation |
| ***Oestrogen-secreting ovarian tumour*** (e.g., granulosa cell tumour) | Direct exogenous oestrogen production |

> **Key concept:** A full-term pregnancy before age 30 is protective because it induces terminal differentiation of breast lobular cells (Type 3 → Type 4 lobules), which are more genetically stable and less susceptible to carcinogenic transformation. Nulliparity or late first pregnancy means the breast retains immature, undifferentiated Type 1 and Type 2 lobules for longer — these are the cells most vulnerable to malignant change.

#### 4.3.2 Exogenous Oestrogen

| Factor | Detail |
|---|---|
| ***Combined oral contraceptive pills (COC)*** [3][5] | Small increase in risk during use and shortly after; risk returns to baseline ~10 years after cessation |
| ***Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)*** [3][5] | Combined oestrogen-progestogen HRT increases risk; risk increases with duration of use; oestrogen-only HRT (in post-hysterectomy women) has a smaller or negligible increased risk |

### 4.4 Obesity & Metabolic Factors

***Obesity risk depends on menopausal status*** [1]:

| Menopausal status | Effect of obesity | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-menopausal** | ***Decreased risk*** | Obesity causes anovulation → less cyclic oestrogen peaks (oestrogen synthesis is primarily ovarian in pre-menopausal women) |
| **Post-menopausal** | ***Increased risk*** | After menopause, the ovaries cease oestrogen production. The primary source of oestrogen becomes **peripheral adipose tissue** via the **aromatase enzyme** (converts adrenal androgens to oestrone). More adipose tissue → more aromatase → more oestrogen → increased breast cancer risk |

This is also why **aromatase inhibitors** (e.g., anastrozole, letrozole) are used as treatment in **post-menopausal** ER+ breast cancer — they block this peripheral conversion.

***Physical inactivity*** also increases risk, likely through obesity-related and insulin resistance mechanisms [5][3].

### 4.5 Medical History

| Factor | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Personal history of breast cancer** | ***Increased risk of contralateral breast cancer*** [1] |
| **Prior benign breast disease with atypia** | ***Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH): 4–5× increased relative risk*** [1]; ***Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH): similar risk*** |
| ***Proliferative fibrocystic changes*** | ***Increased risk*** (moderate/florid hyperplasia, especially with atypia) [5] |
| ***LCIS*** | ***Premalignant condition — marker and precursor for bilateral invasive carcinoma (~1%/year)*** [5][7] |
| ***DCIS*** | ***Precursor to invasive ductal carcinoma of the same breast (~1%/year)*** [2] |

<Callout title="Relative Risk of Breast Cancer from Benign Breast Disease" type="idea">

***American College of Pathologists Consensus Statement*** [4]:

| Risk Category | Lesions |
|---|---|
| **No increased risk** | Adenosis, apocrine metaplasia, cysts, duct ectasia, fibroadenoma, fibrosis, mild hyperplasia, mastitis, periductal mastitis, squamous metaplasia |
| **Slightly increased (1.5–2×)** | Moderate or florid hyperplasia (solid or papillary), papilloma with fibrovascular core |
| **Moderately increased (5×)** | ***Atypical hyperplasia (ductal or lobular)*** |
| **Insufficient data** | Solitary papilloma of lactiferous sinus, radial scar |

</Callout>

### 4.6 Lifestyle Factors

| Factor | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Smoking*** [5] | Carcinogens in tobacco smoke (aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) can form DNA adducts in breast tissue; also anti-oestrogenic effects may partly counterbalance this — net effect is a modest increase in risk |
| ***Alcohol*** [1] | Increases circulating oestrogen levels, generates acetaldehyde (a carcinogen), impairs folate metabolism (needed for DNA methylation and repair) |
| ***Diet*** [5] | High-fat, Westernised diets associated with higher risk (likely mediated through obesity) |

### 4.7 Radiation Exposure

***Exposure to therapeutic ionising radiation*** — particularly chest/mediastinal radiation at a young age (e.g., mantle radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma) — significantly increases breast cancer risk. The younger the age at exposure, the higher the risk (developing breast tissue is more radiosensitive) [1][5].

### 4.8 Male Breast Cancer

A brief but important mention [2][6]:

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Incidence | ***M:F ≈ 1:100*** |
| Average age at diagnosis | ***65 years*** |
| Risk factors | ***BRCA2 carriers***, increased oestrogen exposure (oestrogen therapy, liver disease), radiation, ***Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY)*** — extra X chromosome → hypogonadism + relative oestrogen excess |
| Management | ***Mastectomy + SLNB/ALND (if clinically positive LN)*** |

## 5. Pathophysiology — Multi-Step Carcinogenesis

Breast cancer arises through a **stepwise progression** of genetic and epigenetic alterations:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Normal Epithelium"] --> B["Usual Hyperplasia"]
    B --> C["Atypical Hyperplasia\n(ADH/ALH)"]
    C --> D["Carcinoma In Situ\n(DCIS/LCIS)"]
    D --> E["Invasive Carcinoma"]
    E --> F["Metastatic Disease"]
```

### Key Steps:
1. **Initiation:** A genetic insult (inherited or acquired) causes a mutation in a proto-oncogene or tumour suppressor gene (e.g., TP53, PIK3CA, BRCA1/2 loss, HER2 amplification)
2. **Promotion:** Hormonal stimulation (especially oestrogen) drives proliferation of initiated cells, expanding the clone
3. **Progression:** Additional mutations accumulate (loss of cell cycle control, angiogenesis activation, evasion of apoptosis) → in-situ carcinoma
4. **Invasion:** Disruption of the basement membrane (loss of myoepithelial cell integrity, upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases) → invasive carcinoma
5. **Metastasis:** Invasion of lymphovascular spaces → lymphatic spread (regional LN) and haematogenous spread (distant organs)

### Modes of Spread [1]

| Mode | Details |
|---|---|
| **Direct spread** | Into chest wall (pectoralis, intercostal muscles, ribs), skin and subcutaneous tissues |
| **Lymphatic spread** | Axillary LN (most common), internal mammary LN, supraclavicular LN |
| **Haematogenous spread** | ***Bone > Liver > Lung > Brain > Ovaries > Adrenals > Pleura*** [1][2] |

> **Why is bone the most common site of distant metastasis?** Breast cancer cells have tropism for the bone marrow microenvironment — they express CXCR4 (chemokine receptor) that binds to CXCL12 (SDF-1) produced by bone marrow stromal cells. Additionally, the **vertebral venous plexus (Batson's plexus)** provides a direct, valveless venous route from the breast/thoracic wall to the vertebral column.

## 6. Classification

### 6.1 Histological Classification

***Breast cancers*** are broadly classified into ***in-situ carcinoma*** and ***invasive carcinoma*** [5][7]:

#### 6.1.1 Carcinoma In Situ

Malignant cells confined **within the basement membrane** (i.e., no stromal invasion).

| Feature | ***Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)*** | ***Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)*** |
|---|---|---|
| Frequency | ***~20% of all breast cancers*** [2] | Rare (incidental finding) |
| Pathology | Malignant cells within TDLU (ductal predominant) without invasion; **Low grade:** non-comedo (e.g., cribriform); **High grade:** comedo necrosis (central necrosis → ***dystrophic calcification***) | Malignant cells within TDLU (lobular predominant) without invasion; ***loss of E-cadherin*** (cell adhesion molecule) |
| Clinical features | ***Asymptomatic, non-palpable; usually unifocal*** [2] | ***Asymptomatic, non-palpable; usually multifocal + multicentric*** [2] |
| Mammography | ***Microcalcifications*** (especially in comedo type — the necrotic debris calcifies) | ***Usually NAD*** (incidental finding on biopsy for other reasons) [2] |
| Cancer risk | ***Precursor to invasive ductal carcinoma of the same breast (~1%/year)*** [2] | ***Precursor AND marker of bilateral invasive carcinoma (ductal or lobular, ~1%/year)*** [2] |
| Grading | Van Nuys Prognostic Index (considers size, margin, grade, age) [2] | — |
| Management | ***BCS (2mm margin) + RT if high risk*** (first line if disease limited to one quadrant and cosmetically acceptable); ***Mastectomy + SLNB*** (SLNB because altered lymphatic drainage after mastectomy makes it impossible to perform SLNB later if IDC is found — ***10–20% chance***); Adjuvant: ***tamoxifen/AI if ER/PR+*** [2] | Classical LCIS: ***close observation***; Non-classical (pleomorphic) LCIS: ***more aggressive → surgical excision*** [2] |

<Callout title="Why SLNB with Mastectomy for DCIS?" type="error">
A common point of confusion: "If DCIS is non-invasive, why do SLNB?" The answer is that mastectomy destroys the lymphatic drainage patterns of the breast. If the final mastectomy specimen reveals an occult invasive focus (which occurs in **10–20% of cases**), you can no longer perform an accurate SLNB afterwards. So you do it at the time of mastectomy as a "safety net." [2]
</Callout>

#### 6.1.2 Invasive Carcinoma

| Subtype | Frequency | Key Features | Prognosis |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Invasive ductal carcinoma, no special type (NOS)*** | ***~80%*** [5][7] | Most common; forms a hard, stellate mass with desmoplastic stroma; various grades | Variable; depends on grade and stage |
| ***Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)*** | ***~3–8%*** [2][7] | ***E-cadherin mutation → loose, diffuse infiltrating pattern ("Indian file" single-cell pattern) → more difficult to detect clinically and on mammography***; usually ***ER+ only***; associated with ***post-menopausal HRT use***; tends to be ***multifocal, multicentric, bilateral***; metastasises to ***unusual sites (meninges, GI tract, peritoneum)*** [1] | Similar to IDC overall; short-term outcomes may be more favourable [1] |
| **Good-prognosis subtypes** | | ***Tubular, medullary, mucinous (colloid), papillary*** [1][7] | Better prognosis |
| **Poor-prognosis subtypes** | | ***Mixed ductal/lobular, metaplastic, micropapillary*** [1] | Worse prognosis |
| ***Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)*** | Rare | See below | Very poor |

#### 6.1.3 Special Types

**Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC)** [1]:

***By definition T4d in TNM staging.*** A rare, aggressive form that ***resembles mastitis clinically and radiologically*** but is ***NOT a true inflammatory process***.

The mechanism: tumour cells invade and obstruct the ***dermal lymphatic channels*** of the breast → lymphatic obstruction → oedema of overlying skin → ***peau d'orange*** (skin resembling an orange peel due to tethering at the sites of sweat gland/hair follicle openings while surrounding skin is oedematous).

***Diagnostic criteria*** [1]:
1. Rapid onset of breast ***erythema, oedema, peau d'orange, or warm breast*** ± underlying palpable mass
2. ***Erythema occupying at least 1/3 of the breast***
3. ***Duration of history no more than 6 months***
4. ***Pathological confirmation of invasive carcinoma***

> **Key distinguishing point:** Mastitis → associated with ***fever and leukocytosis***; IBC is ***NOT*** associated with these (it is not a true infection/inflammation) [1].

**Paget's Disease of the Nipple** [1]:

- "Paget" cells = malignant intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells migrating from an underlying carcinoma into the epidermis of the nipple
- Characterised by ***eczematoid changes and ulcerated lesions of the nipple-areolar complex***
- ***Almost ALWAYS (~80%) associated with an underlying breast cancer, which is typically HER2-positive*** [1]
- Presents with ***pain, burning, pruritus, palpable breast mass, bloody nipple discharge, or nipple inversion***
- Diagnosis: ***full-thickness wedge biopsy of the nipple*** showing Paget cells
- Treatment: ***excision of the underlying cancer + nipple-areolar complex*** (mastectomy or BCT + whole-breast irradiation) [1]

### 6.2 Molecular Subtypes (St Gallen IHC Classification)

This is a **clinically crucial** classification because it determines treatment strategy [1][2]:

| ***Subtype*** | ***IHC Definition*** | ***Frequency*** | ***Treatment*** | ***Prognosis*** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ***Luminal A*** | ***HR+/HER2−/Ki67 low*** | ~40% | ***Endocrine therapy alone*** (± cytotoxics if high nodal burden) [2] | ***Best prognosis*** |
| ***Luminal B (HER2−)*** | ***HR+/HER2−/Ki67 high*** | ~20% | ***Endocrine therapy ± cytotoxic therapy*** [2] | Intermediate |
| ***Luminal B (HER2+)*** | ***HR+/HER2+*** | ~10% | ***Cytotoxics + anti-HER2 + hormonal therapy*** [2] | Intermediate |
| ***HER2-positive (non-luminal)*** | ***HR−/HER2+*** | ***~15%*** [1] | ***Cytotoxics + anti-HER2 therapy (e.g., trastuzumab); NO response to hormonal treatment*** [1] | ***Poor prognosis*** |
| ***Triple-negative (basal-like)*** | ***HR−/HER2−*** | ***~15%*** [1] | ***Cytotoxic therapy (platinum-based); PARP inhibitors if BRCA-mutant; immunotherapy (pembrolizumab if PD-L1+); NO response to Herceptin or hormonal treatment*** [1] | ***Poor prognosis*** |

<Callout title="Understanding the Molecular Subtypes">

**Why do these subtypes matter?** They dictate which therapeutic "weapons" you can use:
- **ER/PR+** → You can use **endocrine therapy** (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors) because the tumour depends on oestrogen for growth.
- **HER2+** → You can use **anti-HER2 therapy** (trastuzumab/Herceptin, pertuzumab) because the tumour overexpresses HER2 receptors driving proliferation.
- **Triple-negative** → You have **no targeted receptor to exploit** → relies on **cytotoxic chemotherapy**, though PARP inhibitors are now available for BRCA-mutant cases and immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab) for PD-L1+ tumours.

**Ki67** is a nuclear antigen that marks proliferating cells. **High Ki67** = more aggressive, faster-growing tumour = more likely to respond to chemotherapy (because chemo targets rapidly dividing cells) but also carries a worse prognosis.
</Callout>

**Key receptors explained:**
- **ER (Oestrogen Receptor):** A nuclear transcription factor. When oestrogen binds → activates gene transcription promoting cell proliferation. Tamoxifen is a **selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM)** that competitively blocks oestrogen binding.
- **PR (Progesterone Receptor):** Expression is oestrogen-driven; PR+ confirms a functioning ER pathway. PR+ tumours have even better prognosis among HR+ cancers.
- **HER2 (Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2):** A transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor (ErbB2/neu). Amplification → constitutive activation of downstream RAS-MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways → uncontrolled proliferation. Trastuzumab ("Herceptin") is a monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular domain of HER2, blocking signalling and marking the cell for immune-mediated destruction (ADCC).

### 6.3 TNM Staging (AJCC 8th Edition, 2017)

The TNM staging system classifies breast cancer based on:

**T — Primary Tumour:**

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| Tis | Carcinoma in situ (DCIS, Paget's without associated mass) |
| T1 | ≤ 2 cm (T1mi ≤ 0.1 cm, T1a > 0.1–0.5 cm, T1b > 0.5–1 cm, T1c > 1–2 cm) |
| T2 | > 2–5 cm |
| T3 | > 5 cm |
| T4 | Any size with direct extension to chest wall (T4a), skin oedema/ulceration/satellite nodules (T4b), both (T4c), ***inflammatory carcinoma (T4d)*** |

**N — Regional Lymph Nodes:**

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| N0 | No regional LN metastasis |
| N1 | Movable ipsilateral axillary LN (Level I–II) |
| N2 | Fixed/matted ipsilateral axillary LN (N2a) or ipsilateral internal mammary LN without axillary LN involvement (N2b) |
| N3 | Ipsilateral infraclavicular LN (N3a), ipsilateral internal mammary + axillary LN (N3b), ipsilateral supraclavicular LN (N3c) |

**M — Distant Metastasis:**

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| M0 | No distant metastasis |
| M1 | Distant metastasis present (including contralateral supraclavicular LN) |

**Stage Grouping:**

| Stage | TNM | 5-Year Survival (HK) |
|---|---|---|
| Stage I | T1 N0 M0 | ***97.5%*** [1] |
| Stage II | T0–1 N1, T2 N0–1, T3 N0 | ***87.8%*** [1] |
| Stage III | T0–2 N2, T3 N1–2, T4, any N3 | ***66.2%*** [1] |
| Stage IV | Any T, Any N, M1 | ***19.3%*** [1] |

> The AJCC 8th edition also introduced a **Prognostic Stage** that incorporates tumour grade, ER, PR, HER2 status, and genomic assays (e.g., Oncotype DX) — this can upstage or downstage patients relative to anatomic staging alone.

## 7. Clinical Features

### 7.1 Symptoms

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| ***Painless breast lump*** (most common presenting complaint) | Malignant proliferation forms a mass; breast cancers are typically painless because they grow insidiously without stretching the breast capsule rapidly (unlike infection/inflammation). Pain can occur with larger tumours or inflammatory type |
| ***Nipple discharge*** (especially ***unilateral, single-duct, bloody***) [2] | Tumour eroding into or arising from a duct → disrupts duct lining → bloody discharge. Serous/serosanguinous discharge may also occur. The high-risk features (***unilateral, single duct, bloody***) point towards an intraductal lesion (either papilloma or DCIS/invasive cancer) rather than bilateral physiological discharge |
| ***Nipple retraction/inversion*** (new onset) | Tumour invading and fibrosis of the ***subareolar lactiferous ducts*** → tethering and retraction of the nipple. Must distinguish from **longstanding congenital inversion** (benign) |
| ***Skin changes — peau d'orange*** | Tumour cells block ***dermal lymphatic channels*** → lymphatic oedema of the skin → skin pits at sweat gland/hair follicle openings (which are tethered by Cooper's ligaments), creating the "orange peel" appearance |
| ***Skin dimpling / tethering*** | Tumour invades or causes fibrotic reaction in ***Cooper's ligaments*** (suspensory ligaments that connect the breast parenchyma to the skin and chest wall) → shortening of these ligaments → dimpling of overlying skin, especially on raising arms |
| ***Skin ulceration*** | Advanced local disease — tumour erodes through skin (T4b) |
| ***Nipple eczema*** (Paget's disease) | Malignant cells (Paget cells) migrate from an underlying ductal carcinoma into the nipple epidermis → eczematous, crusting, erythematous change of the nipple-areolar complex [1] |
| ***Breast pain / mastalgia*** | Uncommon in breast cancer; when present, suggests ***inflammatory breast cancer*** (dermal lymphatic obstruction), rapid tumour growth, or nerve invasion. **Non-cyclical, unilateral, focal pain warrants investigation** [2] |
| ***Axillary lump*** | Lymphatic metastasis to axillary lymph nodes → may present as the primary complaint (sometimes the primary breast tumour is occult) |
| ***Constitutional symptoms*** | ***Weight loss, bone pain, shortness of breath*** [2] → suggest advanced/metastatic disease (bone metastasis, lung metastasis, liver metastasis) |

### 7.2 Signs

On **physical examination** (performed with patient at **45°**) [2]:

#### 7.2.1 Inspection

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| ***Asymmetry*** | Tumour mass distorting breast contour |
| ***Skin changes*** — erythema, oedema, peau d'orange, dimpling, ulceration, satellite skin nodules | As described above — lymphatic obstruction, Cooper's ligament invasion, direct skin invasion |
| ***Nipple changes — the "5 Ds"*** [2]: ***Deviation, Discolouration, Dermatitis (Paget's), Depression (retraction), Discharge*** | Tumour traction on ducts (deviation, depression), epidermis invasion (dermatitis/Paget's), duct erosion (discharge), local inflammation (discolouration) |
| ***Surgical scars*** | Previous breast or axillary surgery |

#### 7.2.2 Palpation of Breast

A malignant breast mass classically has the following characteristics [1][2]:

| Feature | Malignant (Breast Cancer) | Benign (e.g., Fibroadenoma) |
|---|---|---|
| **Consistency** | ***Hard*** (desmoplastic stromal reaction around tumour) | Rubbery/firm |
| **Border** | ***Irregular, ill-defined*** (infiltrative growth pattern) | Well-defined, smooth |
| **Surface** | ***Irregular*** | Smooth |
| **Tenderness** | ***Usually non-tender*** | Non-tender or mildly tender |
| **Mobility** | ***Fixed to skin or underlying muscle*** (late sign — tumour invades Cooper's ligaments/pectoralis fascia) | Highly mobile ("breast mouse") |
| **Site** | ***Most commonly upper outer quadrant (~60%)*** [4] | Any quadrant |

> **Testing fixation:**
> - **Skin fixation:** Pinch the skin over the mass — if the mass is fixed to skin, the skin will dimple/pucker
> - **Chest wall/muscle fixation:** Ask the patient to press hands on hips (contracts pectoralis major) — if the mass is fixed to the muscle, it becomes less mobile with contraction

#### 7.2.3 Palpation of Axilla

***The axillary lymph nodes are examined in five groups*** [2]:
1. **Anterior (pectoral)** — along the lateral border of pectoralis major
2. **Posterior (subscapular)** — along the lateral border of the scapula
3. **Medial (central)** — high up against the chest wall
4. **Lateral (humeral)** — along the medial aspect of the humerus
5. **Apical** — at the apex of the axilla

Comment on: ***number, site, size, consistency, tenderness, fixation*** [2].

Involved nodes feel **hard, non-tender, matted (fixed to each other), or fixed to adjacent structures**. Also examine the **supraclavicular fossa** and **infraclavicular region** for lymphadenopathy.

#### 7.2.4 Signs of Metastatic Disease

| Site | Signs to elicit |
|---|---|
| **Bone** | Bony tenderness (spine, pelvis, long bones), pathological fractures |
| **Liver** | Hepatomegaly, jaundice, ascites |
| **Lung/Pleura** | Decreased breath sounds (effusion), crackles |
| **Brain** | Focal neurological deficits, signs of raised ICP |

### 7.3 Multifocal vs. Multicentric Disease [2]

| Term | Definition | Implication for Surgery |
|---|---|---|
| ***Multifocal*** | ≥ 2 foci within a limited area (usually **same quadrant**) | ***Not a contraindication to breast-conserving therapy (BCT)*** |
| ***Multicentric*** | ≥ 2 foci in **different quadrants** | ***Contraindication to BCT*** → mastectomy required |

## 8. Screening

### 8.1 HK Cancer Expert Working Group (CEWG) Recommendations [3]

***For average-risk women:***
- ***Women aged 44–69*** with ***certain combinations of personalised risk factors*** (including ***first-degree relative with breast cancer, prior benign breast disease, nulliparity, late first live birth, early menarche, high BMI, and physical inactivity***):
  - ***Recommended to consider mammography screening every two years***
  - ***Should discuss with doctors about potential benefits and harms***

### 8.2 Practical HK Screening Approach [1][3][4]

| Age | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| ***All ages*** | ***Monthly breast self-examination*** |
| ***≥ 40 years*** (earlier if high risk e.g., FHx positive) | ***Annual mammogram + USG*** |
| Age 30 (ACS guidelines) | Yearly breast examination by doctor |
| Age 40 (ACS) | Mammogram every 2 years + yearly clinical exam |
| Age 50 (ACS) | Annual mammogram + yearly clinical exam |

<Callout title="Why USG in HK Screening?" type="idea">
***USG should be considered as part of screening apart from mammography*** because ***younger Asian women have denser breasts***, which reduces mammographic sensitivity (dense tissue appears white on mammogram, as does cancer — the "finding a snowball in a snowstorm" problem). USG can detect lesions within dense tissue that mammography misses [1][3].
</Callout>

### 8.3 Genetic Testing & Counselling [1]

***Criteria for referral for genetic counselling*** [1]:
- **Personal history:**
  - Breast cancer diagnosed at age ***≤ 50***
  - ***Triple-negative breast cancer***
  - ***Male breast cancer (BRCA2)***
- **Family history:**
  - ***≥ 2 relatives with breast cancer, one diagnosed at age ≤ 50***
  - ***≥ 3 relatives with breast cancer at any age***
  - ***Previous identified BRCA1/2 mutation in family***

***Principles of genetic testing*** [1]:
1. ***Always test the AFFECTED individual first***
2. ***Only if a mutation is identified***, then test unaffected family members
3. ***NEVER test an unaffected individual first*** — because a negative result from a family where no mutation has been identified is **uninformative** (other predisposition genes may exist that haven't been identified yet)

## 9. Prognostic Factors [1]

| Category | Factors Associated with Poor Prognosis |
|---|---|
| **Patient** | Extreme of age (very young or very old), smoking |
| **Tumour size** | Large (higher T stage) |
| **Nodal status** | More nodes involved = worse |
| **Metastasis** | Presence of distant metastasis |
| **Grade** | ***Poorly differentiated (Grade 3)*** |
| **Proliferation** | ***High Ki67*** (detected by immunohistochemistry) |
| **Histological subtype** | IDC, ILC, mixed ductal/lobular, metaplastic, micropapillary |
| **Receptor status** | ***Absence of ER/PR expression*** (cannot use endocrine therapy), ***HER2 overexpression*** (aggressive biology, though now targetable with trastuzumab) |

---

## 10. Important History-Taking Framework

When assessing a patient with a breast complaint, use this systematic framework [2][3]:

***Important questions in history-taking (must know!)*** [2]:

1. **Mass:** Onset & progression, any cyclical changes / mastalgia
2. **Nipple:** Discharge / retraction
3. **Skin:** Itchiness, erythema, dimpling / peau d'orange
4. **Constitutional symptoms:** Weight loss, bone pain, SOB
5. **Risk factors of malignancy:**
   - ***Family history:*** BRCA — any CA breast / ovary / prostate / pancreas [3]
   - ***Past medical history:*** Prior breast disease (e.g., DCIS), prior breast/chest RT [3]
   - ***Oestrogen exposure:*** Age of menarche, age of menopause, parity, breastfeeding, use of COC/HRT [3]
   - ***First/second degree relative (age of onset)*** [3]
   - ***Hormonal risk: menarche/menopause*** [3]
   - ***Gestational history*** [3]
   - ***Breastfeeding history*** [3]
   - ***Previous breast screening (if any)*** [3]

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Breast Cancer — Key Points:**

1. **Definition:** Malignant neoplasm of breast epithelium (TDLU). In-situ vs. invasive depends on basement membrane breach.

2. **Epidemiology (HK):** 1st most common cancer in females, 3rd overall; median age ~55 (younger than West); lifetime risk 1:16.

3. **Risk Factors — "Oestrogen Exposure" is the unifying theme:** Early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, no breastfeeding, late first pregnancy, COC/HRT, obesity (post-menopausal).

4. **Genetics:** BRCA1/2 (autosomal dominant tumour suppressor genes for DNA repair); Li-Fraumeni (TP53); Cowden (PTEN); CDH1 → lobular cancer.

5. **BRCA1:** ~65% breast cancer risk by 70, ~39% ovarian; associated with triple-negative subtype. **BRCA2:** ~45% breast cancer risk by 70, ~11% ovarian; associated with male breast cancer (~6%).

6. **Pathology:** IDC NOS (80%) > ILC (3–8%) > Special types. DCIS = precursor to IDC; LCIS = marker/precursor for bilateral invasive cancer.

7. **Molecular Subtypes:** Luminal A (best prognosis, endocrine therapy), Luminal B, HER2+ (anti-HER2 therapy), Triple-negative (worst prognosis, chemo/PARP/immunotherapy).

8. **Clinical Features:** Hard, irregular, fixed, non-tender mass in UOQ; nipple discharge (unilateral, bloody, single duct = high risk); peau d'orange (dermal lymphatic obstruction); skin dimpling (Cooper's ligament invasion); nipple retraction (duct fibrosis/invasion).

9. **Paget's Disease:** Eczematoid nipple change + underlying breast cancer (usually HER2+). IBC: T4d, peau d'orange ≥ 1/3 breast, < 6 months history, NOT true infection.

10. **Screening (HK):** Monthly self-exam all ages; mammogram + USG annually from age 40 (earlier if high risk); CEWG recommends biennial mammography for average-risk women aged 44–69 with risk factors.

11. **Genetic Testing:** Test affected individual first → only test unaffected relatives if mutation found.

      question: "A 62-year-old post-menopausal woman with BMI 35 presents with a breast lump. Explain why her obesity increases her breast cancer risk, and why this would NOT apply if she were pre-menopausal.",
      markscheme: "Post-menopausal: ovaries cease oestrogen production; primary source becomes peripheral adipose tissue via aromatase enzyme converting adrenal androgens to oestrone. More fat = more aromatase = more oestrogen = increased risk. Pre-menopausal: obesity causes anovulation, reducing cyclic oestrogen peaks; oestrogen synthesis is primarily ovarian, so adipose aromatase contributes less relatively."

      question: "Name the molecular subtypes of breast cancer according to St Gallen IHC classification, their receptor profiles, and the therapeutic implications of each.",
      markscheme: "Luminal A (HR+/HER2-/Ki67 low) - endocrine therapy alone; Luminal B HER2- (HR+/HER2-/Ki67 high) - endocrine +/- chemo; Luminal B HER2+ (HR+/HER2+) - chemo + anti-HER2 + endocrine; HER2+ non-luminal (HR-/HER2+) - chemo + anti-HER2; Triple-negative (HR-/HER2-) - chemo, PARP inhibitors if BRCA-mutant, immunotherapy if PD-L1+."

    {
      question: "Explain the pathophysiology of peau d'orange in breast cancer. What is the TNM classification for inflammatory breast cancer?",
      markscheme: "Tumour cells invade and obstruct dermal lymphatic channels, causing lymphatic oedema of overlying skin. Skin pits at sweat gland/hair follicle openings (tethered by Cooper's ligaments) while surrounding skin is oedematous, creating orange-peel appearance. Inflammatory breast cancer = T4d by definition."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the two-hit hypothesis in the context of BRCA mutations, and why should you NEVER perform genetic testing on an unaffected individual first?",
      markscheme: "Two-hit: First hit = inherited germline mutation (one defective allele in all cells); second hit = somatic mutation/loss of remaining normal allele. Both alleles must be inactivated for loss of DNA repair function and cancer development. Never test unaffected first because a negative result is uninformative - not all predisposition genes are identified; a negative test in a family without a known mutation does not exclude inherited risk."

    {
      question: "A patient has a unilateral eczematous lesion of the nipple. What is the most likely diagnosis, what underlying pathology is almost always present, and what is the typical HER2 status?",
      markscheme: "Paget disease of the nipple. Almost always (~80%) associated with an underlying breast carcinoma. Typically HER2-positive. Diagnosis by full-thickness wedge biopsy showing Paget cells (malignant intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells in nipple epidermis). Treatment includes excision of underlying cancer and nipple-areolar complex."
    },
    {
      question: "Compare DCIS and LCIS in terms of pathology, mammographic findings, cancer risk, and management approach.",
      markscheme: "DCIS: ductal predominant, unifocal, comedo type shows microcalcifications on mammography; precursor to IDC same breast (~1%/year); management = BCS + RT or mastectomy + SLNB, adjuvant tamoxifen/AI if ER+. LCIS: lobular predominant, loss of E-cadherin, multifocal/multicentric/bilateral, mammography usually NAD (incidental); precursor AND marker for bilateral invasive cancer (~1%/year); classical LCIS = observation, pleomorphic LCIS = surgical excision."
