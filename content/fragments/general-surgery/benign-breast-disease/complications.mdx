## Complications of Benign Breast Disease

Complications of benign breast disease arise from two sources: (1) **complications of the disease itself** — i.e., what happens if the condition progresses or is left untreated, and (2) **complications of the treatment** — i.e., the iatrogenic consequences of surgery, biopsy, radiotherapy, and medical therapy used to manage these conditions. Both are clinically important and commonly tested.

### A. Complications of the Disease Itself

#### 1. Progression to Malignancy — The Most Important "Complication"

The single most significant complication of certain benign breast diseases is **malignant transformation** or, more accurately, the **increased risk of subsequent breast cancer development**. This is not a direct transformation in most cases, but rather a marker of genomic instability in the breast epithelium that predisposes to cancer elsewhere in either breast [3][7].

| Benign Condition | Cancer Risk | Mechanism | Clinical Implication |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Non-proliferative lesions** (cysts, duct ectasia, simple fibroadenoma, fibrosis, apocrine metaplasia) | **No increased risk** (1×) [3][7] | Normal epithelium; no excess proliferative activity | Routine follow-up; no enhanced surveillance needed |
| **Proliferative WITHOUT atypia** (usual hyperplasia, sclerosing adenosis, intraductal papilloma, radial scars) | **1.5–2× risk** [3][7] | Excess proliferation increases the probability of acquiring mutations over time, but the cells themselves are still morphologically normal | Moderate vigilance; annual imaging |
| **Proliferative WITH atypia** (***ADH, ALH***) | ***4–5× risk*** [3][7] | Atypical cells have already acquired some of the architectural and cytological features of carcinoma in situ. They sit on a **biological continuum** towards DCIS/LCIS → invasive cancer. ADH in one breast increases risk in **both breasts**, indicating a systemic "field effect" of genomic instability. | ***Enhanced surveillance (yearly mammography + twice-yearly clinical exam) + chemoprevention (tamoxifen/AI)*** [3] |
| **Complex fibroadenoma** | Slightly increased | Contains proliferative changes (ductal hyperplasia, sclerosing adenosis, papillary apocrine changes) within the fibroadenoma [3] | Close follow-up |
| **Multiple intraductal papillomas** (diffuse papillomatosis) | Higher than solitary papilloma [3][5] | Multiple papillomas indicate more widespread proliferative ductal disease | Excision recommended |
| **Phyllodes tumour (malignant subtype)** | Direct malignant potential | Malignant phyllodes is already a sarcoma; the stroma has undergone malignant transformation with high mitotic rate, stromal overgrowth, and infiltrative margins [3] | Can **metastasise haematogenously to lungs** [3] |

> **Why does atypia matter so much?** ADH and ALH cells have begun to lose normal growth control — the nuclei are monomorphic and the architecture is abnormal. They have accumulated some (but not all) of the genetic hits needed for full malignant transformation. One more "hit" (e.g., loss of a tumour suppressor) can tip them over into DCIS or invasive cancer. This is the classic **multi-hit model of carcinogenesis**.

<Callout title="Exam High Yield">
The upgrade rate from ADH on core biopsy to DCIS or invasive carcinoma on excisional biopsy is approximately **15–30%** [7]. This is why excisional biopsy is **mandatory** when ADH/ALH is found on core biopsy — it's not just a risk factor, it may already be harbouring a cancer that was undersampled.
</Callout>

#### 2. Complications of Mastitis — Abscess and Fistula Formation

**Lactational mastitis → Breast abscess [3][4]:**
- ***Progresses to abscess formation in ~25% of patients*** [3]
- Why? Bacteria proliferating in stagnant milk → focal collection of pus walled off by inflammatory tissue. The abscess is often ***NOT fluctuant*** early on because it sits deep within the breast parenchyma surrounded by oedematous, indurated tissue [3].
- **Abscess complications:** If left untreated — pressure necrosis of overlying skin → spontaneous rupture → chronic draining sinus → cosmetic deformity and prolonged wound healing.

**Periductal mastitis → Subareolar abscess → Mammary duct fistula [3]:**
- This is a **recurrent cycle** in smokers:
  1. Smoking → toxic metabolite damage → squamous metaplasia of duct epithelium → duct obstruction
  2. Obstruction → secondary infection (mixed anaerobes + staph) → periductal inflammation
  3. Inflammation → subareolar abscess
  4. Abscess drains (spontaneously or by I&D) **but the underlying diseased duct is not excised**
  5. → Recurrence → ***periareolar fistula*** (communication between the diseased duct and periareolar skin) [3]
  6. → Chronic draining sinus → cosmetic deformity, chronic pain, social embarrassment

> **Why does the fistula keep recurring?** Because the root cause is the diseased duct with squamous metaplasia. Simply draining the abscess removes the pus but leaves the obstructed, metaplastic duct in place. The duct will obstruct again → re-infect → re-abscess → re-drain at the same site. Definitive cure requires **fistulectomy ± total duct excision + smoking cessation** [3].

#### 3. Duct Ectasia Complications [3][4]

- ***Periductal mastitis and breast abscess*** — blocked dilated ducts predispose to secondary infection [3]
- **Nipple retraction** — progressive periductal fibrosis shortens the duct, tethering and inverting the nipple [3]. This is usually irreversible once established.
- **Chronic nipple discharge** — persistent creamy, multicoloured discharge can be socially distressing

#### 4. Phyllodes Tumour — Local Recurrence and Distant Metastasis [3]

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Local recurrence** | Phyllodes tumours have pseudopodia-like extensions beyond the visible tumour margin. If excision margins are inadequate ( < 1 cm), these extensions seed local recurrence. | ***Majority of tumours with positive margins have an unacceptably high local recurrence rate*** [3]. Applies to ALL grades — even benign phyllodes recurs locally if margins are positive. |
| ***Distant metastasis (malignant phyllodes)*** | The stroma degenerates into ***sarcomatous tissue*** → haematogenous spread ***most commonly to the lungs*** [3] | Spread is via blood, NOT lymphatics → ***ALND is NOT indicated*** [3][5]. Lung metastasis presents as multiple pulmonary nodules on CXR/CT. |
| **Pressure effects of large tumour** | Large phyllodes tumour compresses and stretches overlying skin → ***shiny, attenuated skin → pressure necrosis*** [3] | Can distort the breast contour. |

#### 5. Breast Cyst Complications

- **Recurrence** — cysts can recur after aspiration, requiring repeat aspiration or surgical excision [4]
- **Intracystic pathology** — rarely, a cyst may harbour an **intracystic papilloma** or **intracystic carcinoma** (solid component within the cyst wall). This is why blood-stained aspirate or a residual mass after aspiration mandates core biopsy [4][6].

#### 6. IGM Complications [3]

- **Draining sinuses and chronic abscesses** — the granulomatous inflammation can necrotise centrally and form chronic sinus tracts
- **Cosmetic deformity** — large inflammatory masses can distort the breast
- **Rebound inflammation on steroid tapering** — ***discontinuation or tapering of corticosteroids is associated with rebound inflammation*** [3]
- **Slow wound healing if surgery is attempted** — ***surgical excision of IGM is often followed by slow wound healing*** [3], fistula formation, and poor cosmesis

### B. Complications of Treatment (Iatrogenic)

#### 1. Complications of Breast Biopsy (FNAC and Core Needle Biopsy)

| Complication | Mechanism | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Bruising / Haematoma** | Needle penetration of vessels within the breast tissue | Usually minor and self-limiting. Apply pressure post-procedure. |
| **Pain / Discomfort** | Needle trauma to tissue | Minimised by local anaesthesia (for core biopsy) |
| **Infection** | Introduction of skin flora via the needle tract | Rare; sterile technique minimises this |
| **Pneumothorax** | If the needle penetrates through the breast into the chest wall and pleura | Extremely rare; occurs with deep, thin-chested patients. Why? The breast sits directly over the chest wall; a needle advanced too far posteriorly can enter the pleural space. Avoided by using appropriate technique and imaging guidance. |
| **Sampling error** | Core biopsy may miss the most abnormal area of the lesion | The most clinically significant complication. This is why ADH on core biopsy mandates excisional biopsy — the core may have undersampled a DCIS or invasive cancer [7]. |
| **Seeding of tumour cells along the needle tract** | Theoretical concern with core biopsy of malignant lesions | Extremely rare in practice. Studies show this does not affect oncological outcomes. |

#### 2. Complications of Breast Surgery (Excision, Microdochectomy, Mastectomy)

These complications apply whether surgery is performed for benign or malignant disease.

##### General Surgical Complications [3][16]

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ***Wound infection*** [16] | Bacterial contamination of the surgical wound | Standard surgical complication; treated with antibiotics ± wound opening if abscess forms |
| ***Bleeding and haematoma*** [16] | Intraoperative or postoperative bleeding from transected vessels | May require surgical evacuation if large; risk factors include anticoagulant use |
| ***Anaesthetic complications*** [16] | Related to general or local anaesthesia | Rare; includes allergic reactions, respiratory complications |

##### Specific Breast Surgery Complications [16][17]

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ***Seroma*** [16][17] | Collection of **serous fluid** in the dead space created by tissue removal. Lymphatic channels are disrupted during surgery → lymph fluid accumulates. | ***Untreated seroma results in delayed wound healing, wound infection and dehiscence, flap necrosis, and poor cosmetic outcomes*** [16]. Managed with ***insertion of drains or percutaneous aspiration*** [16]. |
| ***Skin flap necrosis*** [16][17] | Insufficient blood supply to thin skin flaps, especially if undermined extensively or in patients with prior radiation | ***Full-thickness skin flap necrosis requires surgical debridement and may require skin grafting*** [16] |
| ***Post-mastectomy pain*** [16] | Damage to intercostal nerves and the intercostobrachial nerve during surgery → neuropathic pain | ***Burning, aching, and tight constriction of the axilla, upper arm, and chest wall*** [16]. Can be chronic and debilitating. |
| ***Phantom breast syndrome*** [16][17] | Altered proprioceptive and sensory cortical representation after breast removal → the brain continues to perceive the breast that is no longer there | ***Change in chest wall sensation; exact cause is unknown*** [16]. ***Might persist years after surgery*** [17]. Analogous to phantom limb pain. |
| ***Arm morbidity*** [16][17] | Damage to nerves/lymphatics during axillary surgery | ***Arm or shoulder pain, swelling, numbness, stiffness*** [16]. ***Frozen shoulder*** [17] — adhesive capsulitis from immobilisation and pain post-surgery |
| **Scarring, dimpling, and mammographic changes** | Excision of breast tissue disrupts the architecture → fibrosis | This is specifically why ***it is NOT necessary to excise all biopsy-proven fibroadenomas*** [3] — unnecessary surgery causes these artefacts that complicate future mammographic surveillance |
| **Damage to the ductal system** | Excision disrupts lactiferous ducts | Can impair future breastfeeding; relevant for microdochectomy and WLE in young women [3] |

#### 3. Complications of Axillary Surgery

Although axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is primarily performed for malignant disease, it is relevant to benign breast disease because: (a) SLNB may be performed with mastectomy for DCIS (to account for the possibility of occult invasive cancer found on final pathology) [7], and (b) students must know the complication profile to understand why ***ALND is NOT indicated for Phyllodes tumour*** [3].

The lecture slides detail these complications [18][19]:

> ***"Axillary dissection: Removal of level I & II lymph nodes. Pectoralis minor as the landmark. Preservation of (special caution to): Long thoracic nerve, Thoracodorsal nerve, Intercostobrachial nerves."*** [18]

> ***"Complications: Lymphedema (up to 10–20% risk), Nerve injuries, General surgical complications (skin infection, scar etc), Frozen shoulder"*** [18]

| Complication | Nerve/Structure Injured | Clinical Effect | Why This Happens |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| ***Seroma (lymphatics)*** [17] | Disruption of axillary lymphatic channels | Fluid collection in the axilla | Lymph fluid has no route to drain after channels are divided |
| ***Long thoracic nerve injury*** [18][19] | Innervates ***serratus anterior*** | ***Pain, weakness, limitation of shoulder elevation, scapular winging*** [19] | Serratus anterior holds the scapula against the chest wall. When denervated, the scapula "wings" off the chest wall, especially on pushing against a wall or forward flexion. |
| ***Thoracodorsal nerve injury*** [18][19] | Innervates ***latissimus dorsi*** | ***Unable to raise the trunk with the upper limb (e.g., climbing)*** [19]. Weak adduction and internal rotation of the shoulder. | Latissimus dorsi is the major adductor/extensor/internal rotator of the shoulder. Also critical for climbing and pulling. |
| ***Intercostobrachial nerve injury*** [18][19] | Sensory nerve — T2 lateral cutaneous branch | ***Sensory loss / paraesthesia of the axilla, medial arm, and lateral chest wall*** [17][19] | This nerve traverses the axilla directly and is almost always sacrificed during ALND. Patients should be warned preoperatively. |
| ***Medial pectoral nerve injury*** [17] | Innervates **pectoralis major** (partly) | Weakness of pectoralis major | Nerve runs close to axillary vessels and can be damaged during Level II dissection |
| ***Axillary vein injury*** [19] | Main venous drainage of the upper limb | Acute haemorrhage; chronic venous congestion | Vein lies at the apex of the axillary dissection field |
| ***Lymphoedema*** [18] | Disruption of lymphatic drainage from the upper limb | ***Up to 10–20% risk*** [18]. Progressive, non-pitting swelling of the ipsilateral arm. | Lymphatic fluid cannot drain through the axillary nodes → accumulates in the arm → chronic oedema → fibrosis → recurrent cellulitis. Managed with ***pneumatic compression devices*** [17]. |
| ***Upper limb lymphangiosarcoma (Stewart-Treves syndrome)*** [17] | Chronic lymphoedema → malignant transformation of lymphatic endothelium | Extremely rare but devastating. Purple/red nodules on the chronically lymphoedematous arm, usually 5–15 years post-surgery. | Chronic lymphostasis creates a locally immunocompromised microenvironment → allows malignant lymphatic endothelial cells to escape immune surveillance. |
| ***Frozen shoulder*** [18] | Post-operative immobilisation + pain → adhesive capsulitis | Stiffness and restricted range of motion of the shoulder | Prevented by early postoperative physiotherapy and mobilisation |

<Callout title="Mnemonic: Nerves at Risk in Axillary Dissection" type="idea">
**"SLIM"** — **S**erratus anterior (long thoracic nerve → winging), **L**atissimus dorsi (thoracodorsal nerve → weak climbing), **I**ntercostobrachial (sensory → numbness medial arm), **M**edial pectoral (pectoralis major → weak pec)
</Callout>

#### 4. Complications of Radiotherapy

Adjuvant radiotherapy is used for borderline/malignant phyllodes tumour and (in the context of breast cancer) after breast-conserving surgery. The lecture slide lists [20]:

> ***"Complications from radiation: Skin burn — preventable with radiogel, Infection, Lung fibrosis, Heart, Lymphoedema, Skin discoloration, Sternal necrosis"***

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ***Skin burn (radiation dermatitis)*** [20] | Direct radiation damage to rapidly dividing basal keratinocytes | Erythema → dry desquamation → moist desquamation (in severe cases). ***Preventable with radiogel*** [20]. |
| ***Skin discoloration*** [20] | Melanocyte stimulation and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation | Permanent darkening of the irradiated field |
| ***Breast skin fibrosis*** [16] | Chronic radiation damage → fibroblast activation → collagen deposition | Breast becomes firm, contracted, and cosmetically altered |
| ***Infection*** [20] | Damaged skin barrier + immunosuppressive effects of radiation | Cellulitis of the irradiated breast/chest wall |
| ***Lung fibrosis*** [16][20] | Radiation scatter to the underlying lung (especially left breast irradiation) → pneumonitis (acute) → fibrosis (chronic) | Presents as cough, dyspnoea; visible on CXR as apical fibrosis in the radiation field |
| ***Cardiotoxicity*** [16][20] | Left-sided breast irradiation → radiation scatter to the heart → pericarditis (acute), coronary artery disease, valvular disease (long-term) | More concerning for left breast irradiation. Modern techniques (deep inspiration breath hold, DIBH) minimise cardiac dose. |
| ***Lymphoedema*** [20] | Radiation fibrosis of axillary lymphatics (especially if combined with ALND) | Compounds the lymphoedema risk from axillary surgery |
| ***Arm oedema*** [16] | Same mechanism — fibrosis of lymphatic channels | |
| ***Rib fracture*** [16] | Radiation-induced osteoporosis of underlying ribs | Stress fractures in the radiation field; usually asymptomatic or presents as localised chest wall pain |
| ***Sternal necrosis*** [20] | Radiation damage to sternal periosteum and bone → avascular necrosis | Rare but serious; can cause chronic pain and infection |
| ***Secondary radiation-induced malignancy*** [16] | Radiation causes DNA damage that can initiate new cancers decades later | Risk of sarcoma (angiosarcoma) in the radiation field, contralateral breast cancer. Typically appears > 10 years after RT. Low absolute risk but important to acknowledge. |

#### 5. Complications of Breast Implants (Relevant to Reconstruction After Mastectomy)

While breast implants are primarily used in the context of breast cancer reconstruction, they are relevant here because mastectomy may be performed for benign disease (e.g., phyllodes tumour with inadequate margins, or prophylactic mastectomy in high-risk patients). The complications are [17]:

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ***Mechanical: Migration, malposition, exposure, rupture*** [17] | Physical failure of the implant | ***Majority of ruptures are often silent*** [17]. Present with ***changes in breast shape/volume, capsular contracture, palpable lumps (breast or axilla), and pain*** [17]. Diagnosed by MRI (best for silicone rupture). |
| ***Implant infections*** [17] | Bacterial contamination at time of insertion or haematogenous seeding | ***Managed by antibiotics ± explantation and irrigation of the pocket → closure over closed suction drainage*** [17] |
| ***Capsular contracture*** [17] | The body forms a fibrous capsule around the foreign body implant (normal foreign body response). When this capsule **contracts**, it compresses the implant. | ***Especially post-infection or radiation*** [17]. Presents as ***painful, fibrous capsule around implant → palpable distortion of breast*** [17]. Graded by Baker classification (I–IV). |
| ***Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL)*** [17] | Chronic inflammatory stimulation of the peri-implant capsule → T-cell lymphoma | ***ALK negative, CD30 positive*** [17]. Typically presents as late-onset seroma > 1 year after implant. ***Disease confined to the capsule: capsulectomy alone is curative*** [17]. ***Adjuvant therapies: chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or anti-CD30 (brentuximab vedotin)*** for advanced disease [17]. |

> **Why does BIA-ALCL occur?** The exact mechanism is debated, but chronic inflammation around the implant (especially textured implants) creates a microenvironment of persistent T-cell activation. Over years, this chronic stimulation can lead to clonal expansion of aberrant T cells → lymphoma. It is exceedingly rare (estimated 1 in 10,000–30,000 implants) but has led to the withdrawal of certain textured implant brands.

#### 6. Complications of Medical Therapy

| Drug | Complication | Mechanism |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Tamoxifen** (used for ADH/ALH chemoprevention) | Endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE), hot flushes, cataracts | Tamoxifen is a SERM — it blocks oestrogen at the breast (beneficial) but has **agonist** activity at the endometrium → endometrial hyperplasia → cancer risk. It also has pro-thrombotic effects via oestrogen agonism on hepatic clotting factor synthesis. |
| **Aromatase inhibitors** (anastrozole, exemestane) | Osteoporosis, arthralgia, fractures | AI suppresses oestrogen → removes the bone-protective effect of oestrogen → accelerated bone loss |
| **Corticosteroids** (used for IGM) | ***Rebound inflammation on tapering*** [3], Cushingoid features, hyperglycaemia, osteoporosis, immunosuppression, weight gain | Steroids suppress the immune system; when withdrawn, the previously suppressed granulomatous inflammation flares back |
| **Danazol** (rarely used for severe mastalgia) | Androgenic side effects: acne, hirsutism, weight gain, voice deepening | Danazol is a synthetic androgen; these are direct androgenic effects |

### Complication Summary Table by Condition

| Condition | Complications of Disease | Complications of Treatment |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Fibrocystic changes** | Rarely any; psychological distress from recurrent symptoms | Biopsy-related (if performed) |
| **Breast cysts** | Recurrence; rarely intracystic carcinoma | Aspiration: bruising, infection, pneumothorax (rare) |
| **Fibroadenoma** | Nil (simple); slight cancer risk (complex) | Excision: scarring, dimpling, ductal damage, mammographic changes |
| **Phyllodes** | ***Local recurrence (if margins inadequate); distant metastasis to lungs (malignant); pressure necrosis of overlying skin*** | WLE/mastectomy complications; RT complications (for borderline/malignant) |
| **Intraductal papilloma** | Persistent bloody discharge; slight cancer risk (multiple papillomas more so) | Microdochectomy: ductal damage, nipple numbness, inability to breastfeed from that duct |
| **Duct ectasia** | ***Periductal mastitis, abscess***; nipple retraction | Microdochectomy complications (as above) |
| **Lactational mastitis** | ***Abscess (25%); fistula; breast deformity*** | Antibiotics: GI upset, allergy; I&D: scarring |
| **Periductal mastitis** | ***Subareolar abscess; mammary duct fistula (chronic recurrence)*** | Fistulectomy: recurrence if duct not excised; total duct excision: loss of breastfeeding capability |
| **IGM** | Draining sinuses; cosmetic deformity; ***rebound on steroid tapering*** | ***Surgical excision → slow wound healing***; steroids → Cushingoid features |
| **ADH/ALH** | ***4–5× increased breast cancer risk (bilateral)*** | Excisional biopsy: scarring; tamoxifen: endometrial cancer, VTE; AI: osteoporosis |
| **Fat necrosis** | Calcification mimicking cancer on future imaging | Core biopsy complications (if performed) |
| **Mondor's disease** | Nil (self-limiting) | Nil (conservative Mx) |
| **Gynaecomastia** | Psychological distress; if malignant aetiology missed → delayed cancer diagnosis | Tamoxifen: as above; mastectomy: scarring, asymmetry |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**1. The most important complication of benign breast disease is progression to or association with malignancy.** Non-proliferative = no risk. Proliferative without atypia = 1.5–2×. Proliferative with atypia (ADH/ALH) = 4–5×. ADH on core biopsy has a 15–30% upgrade rate on excision.

**2. Mastitis → Abscess in 25%.** Abscess is often NOT fluctuant. Diagnosed by failure to respond to antibiotics + USG. Managed by aspiration (normal skin) or I&D (necrotic skin).

**3. Periductal mastitis → subareolar abscess → mammary duct fistula.** Chronic recurrence cycle in smokers. Cure requires fistulectomy ± total duct excision + smoking cessation.

**4. Phyllodes tumour:** Local recurrence if margins inadequate. Malignant type metastasises to lungs haematogenously (NOT lymphatically → ALND NOT indicated).

**5. Axillary dissection complications — know the nerves:** Long thoracic nerve (serratus anterior → winging scapula), thoracodorsal nerve (latissimus dorsi → weak climbing), intercostobrachial nerve (sensory → medial arm numbness), medial pectoral nerve (pectoralis major). Lymphoedema in 10–20%.

**6. Radiotherapy complications:** Skin burn, lung fibrosis, cardiotoxicity (left breast), lymphoedema, secondary malignancy (angiosarcoma), rib fracture, sternal necrosis.

**7. Breast implant complications:** Mechanical failure (often silent rupture), infection, capsular contracture (especially post-infection/radiation), BIA-ALCL (ALK−, CD30+; capsulectomy curative if confined).

**8. Tamoxifen complications:** Endometrial cancer, VTE, hot flushes. AI complications: osteoporosis, arthralgia.

**9. IGM: surgery NOT recommended → slow wound healing. Steroid tapering → rebound inflammation.**
