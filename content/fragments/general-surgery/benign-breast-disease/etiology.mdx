## Definition and Overview

Benign breast disease (BBD) is an umbrella term encompassing a wide spectrum of **non-malignant conditions** affecting the breast — from physiological aberrations of normal development and involution, to inflammatory conditions, to true benign neoplasms. The modern conceptual framework is captured by the ***"Aberrations of Normal Development and Involution" (ANDI)*** classification, which reframes most benign breast conditions not as "diseases" but as aberrations occurring during one of three life phases [1][2]:

1. **Development** (age 15–25) — e.g., fibroadenoma (aberration of lobular development)
2. **Cyclical changes** (age 25–55) — e.g., fibrocystic changes, mastalgia (aberration of cyclical hormonal response)
3. **Involution** (age > 35–55) — e.g., breast cysts, duct ectasia, sclerosing lesions (aberration of lobular involution)

The clinical importance of BBD lies in three domains:
- It is **extremely common** — the single most frequent reason for breast clinic referral
- Some subtypes **increase the risk of subsequent breast cancer** (and must be risk-stratified)
- It can **mimic breast cancer** clinically and radiologically, requiring rigorous triple assessment to exclude malignancy

<Callout title="Key Concept: ANDI Framework">
Most benign breast conditions are best understood as aberrations at a specific life stage rather than discrete diseases. This framework helps you predict which conditions occur at which age and why.

## Epidemiology

- Benign breast disease is **far more common** than breast cancer. Approximately **90% of women presenting with breast symptoms** have a benign condition [2][3].
- ***Fibrocystic changes*** are the **most frequent benign disorder** of the breast overall, affecting up to 50–60% of women clinically and up to 90% histologically during the reproductive years [3].
- ***Fibroadenoma*** is the **most common benign tumour** of the breast, peaking in women aged **15–35** [3][4].
- ***Phyllodes tumour*** accounts for **< 1% of all breast neoplasms** with a median age of diagnosis of **42–45 years** [3].
- Lactational mastitis is **most common in the first 3 months of breastfeeding**, particularly with the first child [2][3].
- In **Hong Kong**, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women (with incidence still rising), which means benign disease is even more prevalent and the need to correctly differentiate benign from malignant is paramount. The ***HK Cancer Expert Working Group (CEWG)*** recommends that women aged 44–69 with certain risk factor combinations consider mammographic screening every two years [5].

## Risk Factors for Breast Cancer in the Context of Benign Disease

Understanding risk factors is critical because certain benign breast diseases themselves are risk factors for subsequent malignancy. From the lecture slides, the following risk factors are highlighted [5][6]:

| Category | Risk Factor | Mechanism |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Demographics | Advanced age, female sex | Cumulative exposure to oestrogen and DNA damage |
| Endogenous oestrogen | ***Early menarche < 12***, ***late menopause > 55***, ***nulliparity***, ***late first pregnancy > 30***, no breastfeeding | Longer lifetime exposure to cyclical oestrogen peaks → promotes proliferation of hormone-receptor-positive epithelium |
| Exogenous oestrogen | COC pills, HRT | Additional oestrogen exposure |
| ***Benign breast disease*** | ***Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), proliferative fibrocystic changes, LCIS*** | Proliferative epithelial changes with/without atypia serve as precursors or markers of genomic instability |
| Genetics | BRCA1/2 mutation, Li-Fraumeni (TP53), Cowden (PTEN), Peutz-Jeghers | Defective tumour suppressor / DNA repair pathways |
| Lifestyle | ***Smoking, diet, obesity, lack of exercise*** | Obesity → peripheral aromatisation of androgens to oestrogens in adipose tissue (especially postmenopausal); smoking → direct carcinogens |
| Other | ***History of breast biopsy showing a premalignant condition*** | Documented histological abnormality |

<Callout title="Exam High Yield" type="idea">
The lecture slide explicitly lists: ***"History of breast biopsy showing a premalignant condition, atypical ductal hyperplasia, proliferative fibrocystic changes, LCIS"*** as risk factors for breast cancer [6]. You must know the relative risk conferred by each histological category (see classification below).
</Callout>

## Anatomy and Function of the Breast

A brief anatomical refresher is essential because every benign condition maps onto a specific anatomical structure.

### Gross Anatomy
- The breast overlies the pectoralis major muscle from the **2nd to 6th rib** vertically and from the **sternal edge to the mid-axillary line** horizontally.
- The **axillary tail of Spence** extends into the axilla — a common site for accessory breast tissue and palpable masses.
- The breast is divided into **four quadrants** (upper outer, upper inner, lower outer, lower inner) plus the central/subareolar region. The **upper outer quadrant** contains the most glandular tissue (~50%), which is why most pathology (benign and malignant) occurs here.

### Microanatomy — The Terminal Duct-Lobular Unit (TDLU)
The functional unit of the breast is the **TDLU**, consisting of:
- **Terminal duct** (the smallest duct segment)
- **Lobule** (a cluster of acini/ductules that produce milk)
- **Intralobular stroma** (hormonally responsive connective tissue surrounding lobules)
- **Extralobular stroma** (fibrous and adipose tissue)

> Why does this matter? Because **the vast majority of both benign and malignant breast pathology arises from the TDLU**. Cysts arise from distension of the TDLU. Fibroadenomas arise from the stroma and epithelium of the TDLU. Ductal carcinoma arises from the ductal epithelium of the TDLU.

### Duct System
- 15–20 **lactiferous ducts** converge on the nipple, each draining a lobe.
- Beneath the areola, ducts widen into **lactiferous sinuses** before opening at the nipple.
- **Intraductal papillomas** arise within these ducts (especially the large subareolar ducts for solitary papillomas).

### Lymphatic Drainage
- ~75% drains to **axillary lymph nodes** (Levels I, II, III relative to pectoralis minor).
- Remaining drains to **internal mammary nodes**, supraclavicular nodes, and contralateral breast.
- Benign reactive lymphadenopathy can occur with inflammatory breast conditions and even large phyllodes tumours.

### Hormonal Responsiveness
- Breast tissue expresses **oestrogen receptors (ER)** and **progesterone receptors (PR)**.
- During the menstrual cycle:
  - **Follicular phase** → oestrogen stimulates ductal proliferation
  - **Luteal phase** → progesterone stimulates lobular differentiation and fluid retention → explains cyclical breast pain and nodularity
  - **Menstruation** → hormone withdrawal → apoptosis and involution
- This cyclical proliferation-and-involution underpins fibrocystic changes and is why symptoms worsen premenstrually.

## Classification of Benign Breast Disease

### A. By Cancer Risk (Histological — American College of Pathologists Consensus) [3][4][7]

This is the most clinically important classification because it directly informs surveillance strategy.

| Risk Category | Relative Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer | Histological Examples |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **No increased risk** (non-proliferative) | **1× (baseline)** | ***Breast cyst (macro/micro)***, papillary apocrine changes (apocrine metaplasia), mild hyperplasia of usual type, non-sclerosing adenosis, ***duct ectasia***, ***fibroadenoma (simple)***, fibrosis, squamous metaplasia, mastitis/periductal mastitis |
| **Slightly increased risk** (proliferative WITHOUT atypia) | ***1.5–2×*** | ***Intraductal papilloma*** (with fibrovascular core), radial scars/complex sclerosing lesions, ductal hyperplasia of usual type (moderate or florid, solid or papillary), ***sclerosing adenosis*** |
| **Moderately increased risk** (proliferative WITH atypia) | ***4–5×*** | ***Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)***, ***atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH)*** |
| Insufficient data | — | Solitary papilloma of lactiferous sinus, radial scar lesion |

<Callout title="Must Know for Exams" type="error">
Students frequently confuse the risk categories. Remember:
- **Non-proliferative = NO increased risk** (cysts, duct ectasia, simple fibroadenoma)
- **Proliferative WITHOUT atypia = 1.5–2× risk** (papilloma, sclerosing adenosis, usual type hyperplasia)
- **Proliferative WITH atypia = 4–5× risk** (ADH, ALH) — these are the ones that mandate enhanced surveillance
The lecture slide specifically lists ***"atypical ductal hyperplasia, proliferative fibrocystic changes, LCIS"*** as risk factors for breast cancer [6].
</Callout>

### B. By ANDI Framework [2]

| Life Phase | Normal Process | Aberration (Benign Disease) | Disease (Extreme End) |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Development (15–25) | Lobular development, stromal development | Fibroadenoma, juvenile hypertrophy | Giant fibroadenoma |
| Cyclical changes (25–55) | Cyclical hormonal response | Cyclical mastalgia, cyclical nodularity, bloody nipple discharge | Incapacitating mastalgia |
| Involution ( > 35) | Lobular involution, duct involution, epithelial turnover | Macrocysts, sclerosing lesions, duct ectasia, mild epithelial hyperplasia | Periductal mastitis, epithelial hyperplasia with atypia |

### C. By Pathological Category

A practical clinical grouping:

1. **Fibrocystic breast changes** (the spectrum of non-proliferative → proliferative ± atypia)
2. **Benign neoplasms** (fibroadenoma, intraductal papilloma, phyllodes tumour, adenoma)
3. **Infective and inflammatory conditions** (lactational mastitis/abscess, periductal mastitis, duct ectasia, fat necrosis, Mondor's disease, idiopathic granulomatous mastitis)
4. **Proliferative stromal lesions** (diabetic mastopathy, pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia)
5. **Gynaecomastia** (benign breast disease of males)

---

## Etiology and Pathophysiology

### 1. Fibrocystic Breast Changes (FBC)

**Etiology:**
- ***Unknown, but believed to result from hormonal imbalance — oestrogen predominance over progesterone*** [3].
- During each menstrual cycle, oestrogen drives ductal epithelial proliferation and stromal oedema; progesterone modulates this. When the ratio is skewed (relative oestrogen excess), the proliferative stimulus is excessive and the cyclical involution is incomplete.
- Over many cycles, this results in a spectrum of histological changes: **stromal fibrosis, macro- and microcysts, apocrine metaplasia, epithelial hyperplasia, and adenosis**.

**Pathophysiology of specific components:**

| Component | Pathophysiology |
|:--|:--|
| **Fibrosis** | Chronic hormonal stimulation → stromal proliferation and collagen deposition |
| **Cysts** | Fluid accumulates in the TDLU because the efferent ductule becomes obstructed or involuted → dilation → macro/microcysts. The epithelium may undergo **apocrine metaplasia** (cells become tall, eosinophilic, resembling apocrine sweat gland cells — this is the breast's "default" metaplastic response to chronic irritation) |
| **Epithelial hyperplasia** | Excessive ductal/lobular epithelial proliferation in response to oestrogen stimulus. When the cells are architecturally and cytologically normal = "usual type hyperplasia." When they begin to show nuclear atypia and abnormal architecture = ADH or ALH |
| **Adenosis** | Increased number of acini per lobule. "Sclerosing adenosis" adds a fibrotic/sclerotic stroma that can distort architecture and mimic invasive carcinoma histologically |

### 2. Breast Cysts

- Arise from the TDLU due to **distension and obstruction of the efferent ductule** [3].
- As lobules involute (typically after age 35), the ductule may become blocked → fluid secreted by the epithelium accumulates → cyst formation.
- Cysts can enlarge rapidly (causing sudden-onset pain) or remain stable.
- Cyst fluid is typically straw-coloured or green-brown. **Blood-stained fluid is concerning and requires cytological analysis** to exclude intracystic carcinoma or papilloma.

### 3. Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia (ADH) and Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia (ALH)

**ADH:**
- Proliferation of **uniform epithelial cells with monomorphic round nuclei** filling **part but not all** of the involved duct [3].
- Architecturally and cytologically resembles low-grade DCIS, but **does not completely fill** the duct cross-section (if it did, it would be classified as DCIS).
- Confers **4–5× increased risk** of subsequent invasive carcinoma in **both** the ipsilateral and contralateral breast — indicating it is a **risk marker** for the whole breast, not just a local precursor.

**ALH:**
- **Monomorphic, evenly spaced, dyshesive cells** filling **part but not all** of the involved lobule [3].
- "Dyshesive" = cells lose intercellular adhesion (due to **loss of E-cadherin**, the same molecular hallmark as lobular carcinoma) — this is why ALH is considered on a spectrum with LCIS.

### 4. Fibroadenoma

- ***Most common benign tumour of the breast*** [3][4].
- A **fibroepithelial neoplasm** — contains both glandular (epithelial) and stromal (fibrous) components, both arising from the TDLU.
- ***Likely hormonal-dependent*** [3]:
  - Increases in size during pregnancy or with oestrogen-based OC pills
  - Persists during reproductive years
  - Regresses or decreases after menopause
- **Simple fibroadenoma** → **NO increased risk** of breast cancer [3].
- ***Complex fibroadenoma*** (contains proliferative changes like papillary apocrine changes, ductal hyperplasia, sclerosing adenosis) → **slightly higher risk** of subsequent cancer [3].
- ***Giant fibroadenoma*** (> 10 cm) should be excised because it ***cannot be distinguished from Phyllodes tumour*** on physical examination or imaging [3].
- ***Juvenile fibroadenoma*** (age 10–18) should be followed up carefully; excision is recommended if > 5 cm or persists to adulthood [3].

### 5. Phyllodes Tumour

- **Phyllodes** comes from Greek **"phyllon"** = leaf — describes the characteristic **leaf-like papillary projections** on histology [3].
- A **fibroepithelial tumour** that resembles fibroadenoma both clinically and on imaging, **but has a hypercellular stroma** with stromal overgrowth.
- Classified as **benign (60–75%), borderline (15–20%), or malignant (10–25%)** based on stromal cellularity, mitotic rate, stromal atypia, margins, and stromal overgrowth [3][4].
  - **Benign** → propensity to **recur locally** if excision margins are inadequate.
  - ***Malignant*** → can ***metastasize distantly, commonly to the lungs*** via haematogenous spread. The stroma degenerates into **sarcomatous** tissue lacking an epithelial component [3]. This is why **axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is NOT required** — spread is haematogenous, not lymphatic [4].
- **Associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome** (AD, TP53 germline mutation) [3].

### 6. Intraductal Papilloma

- A **benign tumour of the epithelium of the mammary ducts**, consisting of a fibrovascular core covered by epithelial and myoepithelial cells [3].
- **Solitary papilloma** typically arises in a **large subareolar duct** → classic presentation is **bloody nipple discharge** (because the fibrovascular core is friable and bleeds easily).
- **Multiple papillomas** (diffuse papillomatosis, defined as ≥ 5 papillomas in a localized segment) arise more peripherally and carry a **higher risk of associated carcinoma** [4].
- Associated with a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer (proliferative lesion without atypia = 1.5–2×) [3].

### 7. Duct Ectasia

- "Ectasia" from Greek **"ektasis"** = dilation.
- Characterised by **dilatation of subareolar ducts** with **periductal fibrosis and inflammation** [3].
- An **age-related involutionary phenomenon** — typically occurs in **older women** (perimenopausal/postmenopausal).
- The dilated ducts accumulate **inspissated secretions** → cheesy, creamy discharge.
- Periductal fibrosis can cause **nipple retraction** (by shortening/tethering the duct).
- Blockage of ducts predisposes to **periductal mastitis** or **breast abscess** [3].
- ***NOT associated with increased risk of breast cancer*** [3].
- ***Not associated with significant periareolar inflammation or infection*** (distinguishes it from periductal mastitis) [3].
- ***Smoking*** is a risk factor (toxic metabolites in tobacco damage the subareolar ducts and predispose to periductal inflammation) [2].

### 8. Lactational Mastitis and Puerperal Breast Abscess

- ***Most common in the first 3 months of breastfeeding*** [2][3].
- **Pathogenesis:** During breastfeeding, nipple trauma (cracks/fissures) allows skin commensals to enter → organisms grow in **stagnant milk** (breast milk naturally contains bacteria) → **ascending infection** → mastitis.
- ***Most common organism: Staphylococcus aureus*** [2].
- ***Progresses to abscess formation in ~25% of patients*** [3].
  - Abscess is often ***NOT fluctuant*** in the early/late stages (because it sits deep within the breast parenchyma surrounded by oedematous tissue) — this is a common exam pitfall.
  - Diagnosis of abscess is made by **failure to respond to antibiotics**, **USG evidence of abscess cavity**, or **aspiration of pus** [3].

### 9. Periductal Mastitis and Mammary Duct Fistula

- Occurs in **younger women** (unlike duct ectasia), strongly associated with ***smoking*** [3].
- **Pathogenesis:** Smoking → toxic metabolites damage the subareolar duct epithelium → **squamous metaplasia** of the duct lining → obstruction → duct dilation → secondary bacterial infection (often **mixed anaerobic organisms** including Bacteroides, or **S. aureus**) → periductal inflammation → may form **subareolar abscess**.
- If the abscess drains (spontaneously or surgically) but the underlying diseased duct is not excised → recurrence → formation of a **mammary duct fistula** (communication between the subareolar duct and the skin, usually at the areolar margin) [3].
- Recurrence is the rule unless the fistula is laid open and the diseased duct excised ± total duct excision.

### 10. Fat Necrosis

- **Ischaemic necrosis of fat lobules** [2].
- **Risk factors:** Trauma (seatbelt injury, sports injury), ***iatrogenic (especially after breast reconstruction, reduction mammoplasty, radiotherapy)*** [2].
- **Pathophysiology:** Damaged adipocytes release lipid → inflammatory response → foreign body giant cell reaction → fibrosis and calcification.
- ***Mimics carcinoma both clinically and radiologically*** — can present as a painless hard lump with skin dimpling, nipple retraction, and spiculated mass with calcification on mammogram [2]. **Core biopsy is required to differentiate from cancer.**

### 11. Mondor's Disease

- ***Superficial sclerosing thrombophlebitis*** of the breast and anterior chest wall [2].
- "Mondor" = named after Henri Mondor, French surgeon.
- **Pathophysiology:** Thrombosis of superficial veins (most commonly the ***thoraco-epigastric vein***, also lateral thoracic vein, superior epigastric vein) → inflammation → sclerosis → palpable subcutaneous cord.
- Often idiopathic; can follow trauma, surgery, or excessive physical activity.
- **Self-limiting** — resolves with conservative management (NSAIDs, warm compression) [2].

### 12. Idiopathic Granulomatous Mastitis (IGM)

- A **rare benign inflammatory breast disease of unknown etiology** that **mimics breast cancer** clinically and radiologically [3].
- Occurs in **young parous women** within a few years of pregnancy (but can occur in nulliparous women).
- **Association with *Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii*** infection [3].
- **Self-limiting** — resolves slowly with complete resolution in **9–12 months** [3].
- ***NO increased risk of subsequent breast cancer*** [3].
- **Diagnosis of exclusion** after excluding TB, sarcoidosis, histoplasmosis, GPA (Wegener's) [3].
- Histology: **granulomatous lesions centred on breast lobules** — non-caseating granulomas (unlike TB which is caseating).

### 13. Proliferative Stromal Lesions

**Diabetic (DM) Mastopathy:**
- Also known as **lymphocytic mastitis/lymphocytic mastopathy** [3].
- Occurs in **premenopausal women with Type 1 DM**.
- Unknown etiology — may represent an **autoimmune reaction** (associated with longstanding insulin-dependent diabetes, often with other autoimmune complications like retinopathy/nephropathy).
- Presents as a hard, irregular, painless mass that can mimic carcinoma.
- ***Does NOT increase risk of subsequent breast cancer*** [3].

**Pseudoangiomatous Stromal Hyperplasia (PASH):**
- A **benign stromal proliferation** that **simulates a vascular lesion** on histology (the slit-like spaces lined by myofibroblasts can look like blood vessels, hence "pseudoangiomatous") [3].
- Presents as a mass or thickening.
- ***Does NOT increase risk of subsequent breast cancer*** [3].

### 14. Gynaecomastia

- "Gynaecomastia" from Greek: **"gyne"** = woman, **"mastos"** = breast — literally "woman's breast."
- ***Benign enlargement of the male breast resulting from glandular proliferation*** [4].
- Distinguish from **pseudo-gynaecomastia (lipomastia)** = fat deposition without glandular proliferation (the "man boob" of obesity).

**Etiology — change in oestrogen:androgen activity ratio** [4]:

| Category | Mechanism | Examples |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Physiological | Normal transient hormonal surges | Newborn (maternal oestrogen), adolescence (transient oestrogen excess), elderly (declining testosterone) |
| ↑ Oestrogen | Increased oestrogen production or decreased clearance | Liver disease (↓ oestrogen metabolism), drugs (***spironolactone*** — inhibits androgen synthesis and action; cimetidine, digoxin, marijuana), oestrogen-secreting tumours |
| ↓ Androgen | Decreased androgen production or action | Hypogonadism (Klinefelter XXY), ***testicular tumour*** (via ↓ testosterone or ↑ hCG/oestrogen), androgen insensitivity syndrome (defect in AR) |

## Clinical Features — Symptoms and Signs

### A. Fibrocystic Breast Changes

**Symptoms:**

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--|:--|
| ***Cyclical breast pain (mastalgia)*** | Premenstrual oestrogen/progesterone surge → stromal oedema and ductal dilatation → stretching of Cooper's ligaments and nerve endings. Pain worsens in the luteal phase and improves after menstruation. |
| **Nodularity/lumpiness** | Stromal fibrosis and cystic dilatation create areas of irregular texture. Generally does **NOT form a discrete well-defined mass** — more of a "ropey" texture, especially in the upper outer quadrants [3]. |
| **Nipple discharge** | Fluid from cysts or hyperplastic ducts may drain via the ductal system. Typically bilateral, multiductal, serous or green — benign pattern. |

**Signs:**

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--|:--|
| Palpable nodularity (upper outer quadrant) | Fibrotic tissue and microcysts concentrated where glandular tissue is densest |
| Bilateral, diffuse, poorly-defined | Hormonal process affects both breasts globally |
| ***Increases in size before menses, returns to baseline after onset of menstrual flow*** | Hormonally-driven fluid retention and stromal oedema resolve when oestrogen/progesterone levels drop [3] |

### B. Breast Cysts

**Symptoms:**

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--|:--|
| Breast mass (sudden onset possible) | Rapid fluid accumulation in an obstructed TDLU → distension → palpable mass |
| ***Acute severe localized pain*** | Acute cyst enlargement stretches the cyst wall and surrounding tissue → sudden nociceptor activation [3] |

**Signs:**

| Sign | Description & Mechanism |
|:--|:--|
| ***Solitary mass*** | Usually single, but can be multiple |
| ***Discrete / ill-defined border*** | Cyst wall is thin; surrounding fibrosis may obscure margins |
| ***Smooth surface*** | Round/ovoid fluid-filled cavity |
| ***Firm consistency*** | Tense fluid under pressure |
| ***Painful or painless*** | Depends on rate of enlargement |
| ***Mobile*** | Not fixed to surrounding tissue (no desmoplastic reaction unlike cancer) |

### C. Fibroadenoma — ***"Breast Mouse"***

**Symptoms:**

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--|:--|
| Painless breast lump | Slow-growing benign tumour without inflammatory component → no pain. The encapsulated nature means no tethering to surrounding structures. |
| May be discovered incidentally | Often small and asymptomatic, found on self-examination or imaging |

**Signs (the classic "breast mouse"):**

| Sign | Description & Mechanism |
|:--|:--|
| ***Site:*** Can be anywhere (20% multiple, ipsilateral or bilateral) | Arises from TDLU which is present throughout the breast [3] |
| ***Shape:*** Spherical or ovoid, sometimes lobulated | Encapsulated growth pattern |
| ***Border:*** Well-defined | Clear capsule separating it from surrounding tissue |
| ***Surface:*** Smooth | Capsule creates a smooth interface |
| ***Consistency:*** Rubbery/firm | Mixed glandular and fibrous tissue → characteristic rubbery feel |
| ***Tenderness:*** Non-tender | No inflammation, no nerve invasion |
| ***Mobility:*** ***Most mobile of all breast lesions*** | Encapsulated, no desmoplasia, slips easily under examining fingers — hence "breast mouse" [3] |

> **Why is it called a "breast mouse"?** Because it is so mobile that it seems to dart away from your examining fingers, like a mouse escaping.

### D. Phyllodes Tumour

**Symptoms:**

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--|:--|
| Rapidly growing breast lump | Hypercellular stroma with high mitotic rate → faster growth than fibroadenoma. History of **rapid growth** should raise suspicion [3]. |
| Usually painless | Benign variants do not cause pain unless very large with pressure effects |

**Signs:**

| Sign | Description & Mechanism |
|:--|:--|
| ***Breast mass:*** Can be anywhere, any size | Similar origin to fibroadenoma (fibroepithelial) |
| ***Well-defined border, smooth or multinodular surface*** | Expansile growth pushes surrounding tissue |
| ***Firm, non-tender, mobile*** | Resembles a large fibroadenoma |
| ***Overlying skin changes:*** Shiny, stretched, attenuated skin | A large tumour stretches the skin over it → the skin thins and becomes shiny. ***Pressure necrosis of overlying skin*** can occur with very large tumours, distorting the breast contour [3]. |
| ***Axillary lymphadenopathy (20%)*** | ***Majority is reactive lymphadenopathy; metastatic lymph node involvement is RARE*** because spread is haematogenous, not lymphatic [3] |

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl" type="idea">
If a patient presents with what looks like a fibroadenoma but is **large (> 5 cm)** and has a history of **rapid growth**, think phyllodes tumour. The clinical and imaging appearance can be identical to fibroadenoma — only histology distinguishes them definitively.
</Callout>

### E. Intraductal Papilloma

**Symptoms:**

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--|:--|
| ***Bloody nipple discharge*** (characteristic) | The papilloma has a **friable fibrovascular core** that bleeds easily into the duct lumen → blood exits via the nipple [3] |
| Serous or serosanguinous discharge also possible | Less florid bleeding or serous fluid production by the epithelium |
| May have a small palpable subareolar mass | The papilloma distends the involved duct |

**Signs:**

| Sign | Mechanism |
|:--|:--|
| Unilateral, single-duct discharge | Solitary papilloma arises in a single large duct |
| ***Bloody discharge expressible from a single duct*** | Pressure on the subareolar region milks blood from the affected duct |
| Small, subareolar, soft mass (if palpable) | The dilated duct containing the papilloma |

### F. Duct Ectasia

**Symptoms:**

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--|:--|
| ***Creamy, cheesy nipple discharge*** — ***sticky, multi-coloured (green/blue/black/occasionally blood-stained)*** | Dilated ducts accumulate inspissated lipid-rich secretions. The colour comes from degradation products of lipids and cellular debris [3]. |
| ***Nipple inversion/retraction*** | Periductal fibrosis **shortens the duct**, pulling the nipple inward [3] |
| Palpable subareolar mass | Dilated duct filled with secretions ± periductal fibrosis |

**Signs:**

| Sign | Mechanism |
|:--|:--|
| ***Palpable subareolar mass/thickening*** | Fibrosed, dilated ducts |
| Nipple retraction (may be bilateral) | Fibrotic tethering |
| Multiductal, bilateral discharge possible | Multiple ducts can be affected |
| ***"Blue breast" — cyst with dark fluid under nipple*** | Inspissated dark fluid visible through thin subareolar skin [2] |

### G. Lactational Mastitis ± Puerperal Abscess

**Symptoms:**

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--|:--|
| ***Breast pain, tenderness, swelling, erythema*** | Acute bacterial infection → inflammatory response (vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, neutrophil infiltration) |
| Fever, malaise | Systemic inflammatory response to infection |
| ***Purulent/foul-smelling discharge*** | Pus draining via the nipple or through skin if abscess points |

**Signs:**

| Sign | Mechanism |
|:--|:--|
| ***Induration, warmth, erythema*** over affected segment | Inflammatory exudate in the parenchyma |
| ***Fluctuant mass (if abscess)*** | Collection of pus — though **often NOT fluctuant** early/deep in breast [3] |
| Fever | Systemic response |
| Axillary lymphadenopathy (reactive) | Regional lymph nodes responding to infection |

### H. Periductal Mastitis / Mammary Duct Fistula

**Symptoms:**

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--|:--|
| Periareolar pain and swelling | Inflammation centred on subareolar ducts |
| Purulent discharge (often from areolar margin) | Abscess draining at periareolar skin |
| Recurrent periareolar abscess | Underlying diseased duct not excised → chronic cycle of infection/drainage |

**Signs:**

| Sign | Mechanism |
|:--|:--|
| Periareolar mass/abscess | Subareolar duct obstruction → secondary infection → abscess |
| Fistula opening at areolar margin | Chronic tract between duct and skin surface |
| Nipple retraction (may be present) | Fibrosis from chronic inflammation |

### I. Fat Necrosis

**Symptoms & Signs — ***Mimics carcinoma clinically*** [2]:**

| Feature | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--|:--|
| ***Painless lump*** | Fibrosis and calcification around necrotic fat |
| ***Skin dimpling*** | Fibrotic reaction tethers skin to underlying tissue |
| ***Nipple retraction*** | Fibrosis may extend to retroareolar area |
| Ecchymosis/bruising (if post-trauma) | Direct tissue damage |
| Hard, irregular mass | Fibrosis and calcification |
| ***Mimics CA radiologically*** (spiculated mass, calcifications) | Fibrotic and calcified necrotic tissue casts suspicious shadows [2] |

### J. Mondor's Disease

**Symptoms & Signs:**

| Feature | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--|:--|
| ***Chest pain*** | Thrombosis and inflammation of the vein wall → perivenous pain |
| ***Palpable subcutaneous cord*** | The thrombosed, sclerosed vein becomes a palpable linear cord running along the breast/chest wall [2] |
| Skin dimpling along the cord | Retraction of overlying skin by the inflamed, contracted vein |

### K. Idiopathic Granulomatous Mastitis (IGM)

**Symptoms & Signs — ***Mimics breast cancer*** [3]:**

| Feature | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--|:--|
| Hard, irregular breast mass | Granulomatous inflammation distorts normal architecture |
| Skin thickening/erythema | Extensive inflammatory reaction |
| Draining sinuses/abscesses | Granulomas can necrotize centrally → secondary infection → sinus tracts |
| Axillary lymphadenopathy | Reactive |
| NO nipple discharge typically | Not a ductal process |

### L. Gynaecomastia

**Symptoms & Signs [4]:**

| Feature | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--|:--|
| ***Rubbery or firm mass extending concentrically from the nipple*** | Proliferating glandular tissue radiates from the subareolar ductal system |
| Bilateral (often) | Systemic hormonal imbalance affects both sides |
| Tender (if acute/recent onset) | Active proliferation and oedema |

## Common Breast Complaints — Clinical Approach

### Breast Lump — Age-Based Differential [2]

| Consistency | ***Young ( < 35)*** | ***Old ( > 35)*** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ***Soft*** | Fibrocystic changes | Fibrocystic changes |
| ***Firm*** | Fibroadenoma | ***Carcinoma*** |
| | Fat necrosis | Fat necrosis (bruising+) |
| | Lipoma | Lipoma |
| | Breast cyst (tense, fluctuant) | Phyllodes tumour (freely mobile) |

### Mastalgia [2]

- ***Cyclical:*** Fibrocystic changes (most common) — bilateral, diffuse, premenstrual
- ***Non-cyclical:*** Acute mastitis, fibroadenoma, inflammatory breast cancer
- **Management approach:**
  - ***Cyclical or bilateral diffuse pain:*** No imaging required, reassurance, conservative (NSAIDs)
  - ***Non-cyclical / unilateral / focal pain:*** USG/mammogram to investigate

### Nipple Discharge [2]

**Key history questions:**
- True nipple discharge? (vs. fluid from skin lesion)
- Unilateral or bilateral?
- Colour?
- Recent pregnancy/breastfeeding?

| Pattern | Colour | Cause |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ***Multiple/bilateral*** | ***Milky*** | Pregnancy, lactation |
| | ***Yellow/green*** | Hyperprolactinaemia (DA agonist drugs, pituitary tumour), infection (***mastitis***, abscess), degenerative (***ductal ectasia***) |
| ***Single duct*** | ***Bloody*** | Fibrocystic changes, ***intraductal papilloma***, CA breast/DCIS |

**Pathological nipple discharge** (concerning features): **unilateral, single-duct, bloody, spontaneous**

**Investigations:** Triple assessment ± nipple discharge cytology ± ductogram/ductoscopy [2].

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**1. Classification by cancer risk is the most testable concept:**
- Non-proliferative (cysts, duct ectasia, simple fibroadenoma) = **NO** increased risk
- Proliferative WITHOUT atypia (papilloma, sclerosing adenosis, usual hyperplasia) = **1.5–2×** risk
- Proliferative WITH atypia (ADH, ALH) = **4–5×** risk — mandate enhanced surveillance

**2. Fibroadenoma** = most common benign tumour; "breast mouse"; peak 15–35; rubbery, mobile, well-defined; simple = no cancer risk; complex/giant = needs excision.

**3. Phyllodes tumour** = "leaf-like"; resembles fibroadenoma but large & rapid growth; malignant variant metastasizes to lung (haematogenous, NOT lymphatic → ALND not needed); requires wide excision with ≥ 1 cm margin.

**4. Intraductal papilloma** = bloody nipple discharge from a single duct; treated by microdochectomy.

**5. Duct ectasia** = dilated subareolar ducts; creamy multicoloured discharge; nipple retraction; NO cancer risk; associated with older age.

**6. Lactational mastitis** = S. aureus; first 3 months of breastfeeding; abscess in 25%; continue breastfeeding + cloxacillin.

**7. Periductal mastitis** = younger women, SMOKERS; squamous metaplasia → fistula if duct not excised.

**8. Fat necrosis** = mimics cancer clinically AND radiologically; core biopsy to exclude malignancy.

**9. Mondor's disease** = superficial thrombophlebitis; palpable subcutaneous cord; self-limiting; NSAID + warm compress.

**10. IGM** = mimics cancer; granulomatous inflammation; self-limiting (9–12 months); diagnosis of exclusion; associated with Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii.

**11. ANDI framework:** Development (fibroadenoma) → Cyclical changes (FBC, mastalgia) → Involution (cysts, duct ectasia).

**12. Gynaecomastia** = altered oestrogen:androgen ratio; suspect malignancy if unilateral, hard, non-tender, with lymphadenopathy in an older man.

      question: "How does phyllodes tumour differ from fibroadenoma in terms of clinical behaviour, metastatic pattern, and required surgical management?",
      markscheme: "Phyllodes: rapid growth, older age (median 42-45), malignant variant metastasizes haematogenously to lungs (not lymphatic, so ALND not required). Requires wide local excision with at least 1 cm margin (vs simple excision for fibroadenoma). If adequate margin cannot be achieved, mastectomy is needed.",

      question: "A 45-year-old woman presents with spontaneous bloody discharge from a single duct. What is the most likely diagnosis and the definitive management?",
      markscheme: "Intraductal papilloma. Definitive management: microdochectomy (surgical excision of the affected lactiferous duct). Must also exclude carcinoma or DCIS via triple assessment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Describe the pathophysiology of periductal mastitis and explain why it is associated with smoking and fistula formation.",
      markscheme: "Smoking causes toxic metabolite damage to subareolar duct epithelium leading to squamous metaplasia, duct obstruction, secondary bacterial infection (mixed anaerobes, S. aureus), periductal inflammation, and subareolar abscess. If abscess drains without excision of the diseased duct, recurrence leads to mammary duct fistula (tract between duct and periareolar skin). Cure requires laying open the fistula and excising the duct.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the ANDI framework and how does it explain benign breast disease across different age groups?",
      markscheme: "ANDI = Aberrations of Normal Development and Involution. Development (15-25): lobular/stromal development aberration leads to fibroadenoma. Cyclical changes (25-55): cyclical hormonal response aberration leads to mastalgia, fibrocystic changes. Involution (greater than 35): lobular involution aberration leads to cysts, duct ectasia, sclerosing lesions. Most benign conditions are aberrations at a specific life stage, not discrete diseases.",
