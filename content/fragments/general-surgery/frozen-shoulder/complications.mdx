## Complications of Frozen Shoulder

Complications of frozen shoulder can be organized into two categories:
1. **Complications of the disease itself** — what happens if the condition runs its natural course or is inadequately treated
2. **Complications of treatment** — iatrogenic complications from conservative and operative interventions

Understanding both requires thinking from first principles about what is happening to the shoulder at each stage.

### A. Complications of the Disease Itself

#### A1. Residual Stiffness / Incomplete Resolution

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Incidence** | Up to **40% of patients** have some degree of permanent ROM restriction |
| **Why it happens** | The thawing phase involves collagen remodeling, but dense fibrosis (especially in the rotator interval and axillary recess) may not fully remodel. The capsule reaches a new equilibrium — more compliant than the frozen phase, but not as supple as normal. AGE-cross-linked collagen (in diabetics) is particularly resistant to enzymatic degradation and mechanical stretching. |
| **Who is at risk?** | Diabetics (AGEs → resistant collagen), patients who present late (established dense fibrosis), patients with poor physiotherapy compliance |
| **Clinical impact** | Mild restriction (10–15° loss of ER) may be functionally insignificant. Severe residual restriction impacts overhead activities, behind-back reaching, and occupational function. |
| **Implication** | ***May not completely resolve spontaneously*** [2] — the old teaching that frozen shoulder is "self-limiting within 2–3 years" is an oversimplification. A substantial proportion of patients are left with some permanent deficit. |

#### A2. Muscle Wasting and Weakness

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Structures affected** | Deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, biceps — essentially all muscles crossing the glenohumeral joint |
| **Why it happens** | The disease course spans 1–3 years. During this time, pain-induced guarding → immobility → disuse atrophy. Skeletal muscle begins to atrophy within **2 weeks** of immobilization, with measurable loss of cross-sectional area. Type II (fast-twitch) fibres atrophy first. |
| **Clinical impact** | Even after ROM is restored, the muscles around the shoulder are weak and deconditioned. This creates a vulnerability — the patient has a mobile but unstable shoulder, prone to re-injury or impingement. |
| **Management** | Active strengthening during the thawing phase and post-operatively is essential. Rotator cuff strengthening restores the dynamic stabilizing force couple; scapular stabilizer strengthening (serratus anterior, lower trapezius) restores normal scapulohumeral rhythm. |

#### A3. Chronic Pain

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Incidence** | ~15% of patients report ongoing pain beyond the expected disease duration |
| **Why it happens** | Prolonged nociceptive input during the freezing phase can lead to **central sensitization** — the dorsal horn neurons become hyperexcitable and amplify pain signals even after the peripheral inflammation has resolved. Additionally, capsular neuropathy (fibrosis entrapping small articular nerve branches) can produce ongoing neuropathic pain. |
| **Clinical impact** | Sleep disruption, depression, reduced quality of life, occupational disability |
| **Management** | Neuropathic pain agents (gabapentin, amitriptyline), pain psychology, continued PT |

#### A4. Contralateral Frozen Shoulder

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Incidence** | 6–17% develop frozen shoulder in the contralateral shoulder, often within 5 years |
| **Why it happens** | The systemic risk factors (DM, thyroid disease, fibroproliferative diathesis) affect both shoulders equally. Additionally, the patient may overuse the contralateral arm to compensate, and some evidence suggests an autoimmune component targeting bilateral capsular tissue. |
| **Clinical impact** | Bilateral restriction is far more disabling than unilateral. Activities of daily living (dressing, hygiene, eating) become severely limited. |
| **Management** | Vigilance — warn patients about the risk; early intervention if symptoms develop in the other shoulder |

#### A5. Disuse Osteopenia

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Why it happens** | Wolff's law — bone remodels in response to mechanical loading. Prolonged immobility removes the loading stimulus from the proximal humerus → osteoclastic resorption exceeds osteoblastic formation → localized osteopenia. |
| **Clinical impact** | Increased fracture risk — particularly relevant if the patient undergoes MUA (forceful manipulation of an osteoporotic humerus → fracture). XR may show osteopenia of the humeral head. |
| **Management** | Weight-bearing/loading exercises as soon as tolerated; calcium/vitamin D supplementation if systemically osteoporotic |

#### A6. Psychological Impact

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Why it happens** | Chronic pain (months), sleep deprivation (night pain), loss of function (can't work, dress, or care for oneself), and the slow, frustrating natural history produce significant psychological burden. |
| **Clinical impact** | Depression, anxiety, catastrophizing, kinesiophobia (fear of movement). These psychological factors independently predict worse outcomes and slower recovery. |
| **Management** | Acknowledge the psychological dimension; reassure about the natural history (it will get better); consider referral to psychology/psychiatry if significant; adequate analgesia to restore sleep |

### B. Complications of Treatment

#### B1. Complications of Intra-articular Steroid Injection

| Complication | Mechanism | Incidence / Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Post-injection flare** | Crystal-induced synovitis from steroid microcrystals precipitating in the joint | 2–5%; self-limiting (24–48 hours); treat with ice, NSAIDs |
| **Infection (septic arthritis)** | Introduction of skin flora during needle passage through the skin into the joint | Rare (~1:15,000–1:50,000 injections); prevented by strict aseptic technique |
| **Hyperglycaemia** | Systemic absorption of corticosteroid → hepatic gluconeogenesis ↑, peripheral insulin resistance ↑ | Significant in diabetics; blood glucose may spike for 24–72 hours; warn patients, advise more frequent glucose monitoring |
| **Tendon weakening** | Steroid inhibits collagen synthesis in nearby tendons → weakening → potential rupture | Avoid repeated injections ( > 3) and avoid injecting directly into tendons |
| **Skin depigmentation / subcutaneous atrophy** | Local corticosteroid effect on melanocytes and subcutaneous fat | Cosmetic; more visible in darker skin |
| **Cartilage damage (chondrotoxicity)** | Repeated intra-articular steroid exposure damages chondrocytes | Evidence for accelerated cartilage loss with frequent ( > 3–4/year) injections |

#### B2. Complications of Manipulation Under Anaesthesia (MUA)

***Complications of MUA*** [2]:

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Fracture (especially during ER)*** [2] | The contracted anterosuperior capsule (CHL/SGHL) acts as a fulcrum. If the capsule doesn't yield, the torque is transmitted to the osteoporotic proximal humerus (disuse osteopenia) → fracture at the surgical neck. ER is the movement that maximally stresses this capsule-bone interface. | **Most feared complication.** Risk is highest in osteoporotic patients and those with prolonged immobility. Can convert a stiff shoulder into a fracture requiring ORIF — a significantly worse outcome. |
| **Rotator cuff tear** | Forceful manipulation can avulse or tear an already degenerated rotator cuff tendon (especially supraspinatus) | Converts a stiff but structurally intact shoulder into one with both stiffness AND a torn motor. MRI pre-operatively helps identify at-risk cuffs. |
| **Labral tear (Bankart lesion)** | Forceful ROM, especially abduction + ER, can shear the glenoid labrum from the glenoid rim | May lead to recurrent instability |
| **Glenohumeral dislocation** | Over-aggressive manipulation → capsular rupture + loss of stabilizing restraints → dislocation | More likely with global capsular tearing |
| **Brachial plexus injury** | Traction neuropraxia from forceful arm positioning | Usually transient (neuropraxia); rarely permanent |
| **Haemarthrosis** | Capsular tearing → bleeding into the joint from capsular vessels | Can cause post-procedure swelling and pain; usually self-limiting |

#### B3. Complications of Arthroscopic Capsular Release

***Complications of arthroscopic capsular release*** [1][2]:

| Complication | Mechanism | Details from Lecture |
|---|---|---|
| ***Residual stiffness (early mobilisation)*** [2] | The release sites are open wounds. Standard wound healing lays down scar tissue. Without immediate and sustained mobilization, collagen cross-links in a contracted position → re-adhesion → recurrent stiffness. | **Most common complication** and the most preventable — ***intensive post-operative physiotherapy*** is the key. Begins day 0. |
| ***Axillary nerve injury*** [1][2] | The axillary nerve (C5, C6) runs along the inferior capsule, approximately 1–2.5 cm below the inferior glenoid rim. During inferior capsular release (part of 360° release), the electrocautery or instruments can directly injure the nerve. ***Axillary nerve injury incidence: 0.6%*** [1] *(J Pak Med Assoc, 2007)* | Results in deltoid weakness (can't abduct past 15°) and sensory loss over the "regimental badge" area (lateral deltoid). Usually neuropraxia (recovers in weeks–months); neurotmesis is rare but devastating. |
| ***Dislocation*** [1] | Over-release of the capsule removes the static stabilizers of the GH joint → the humeral head can sublux or dislocate. ***"AVOID release too much"*** [1] | *(Am J Orthop, 2007)* [1]. More likely with overzealous 360° release. The surgeon must balance restoring ROM with preserving stability. |
| ***Superficial wound infection*** [1] | Portal site (arthroscopy entry point) infection from skin flora | Usually managed with oral antibiotics and wound care; deep infection is rare but requires washout |
| **Haemarthrosis** | Cauterization of capsular vessels can be incomplete; capsular vessels bleed into the joint | Usually self-limiting; may require aspiration if tense |
| **Chondral damage** | Instruments (electrocautery, shaver) in a tight joint can inadvertently damage the articular cartilage of the humeral head or glenoid | Careful surgical technique and adequate joint distension minimize this risk |
| **Fluid extravasation** | Arthroscopic fluid (saline) extravasates into surrounding soft tissues through the capsular release sites | Can cause swelling, compartment-like effects; usually resolves spontaneously |

<Callout title="Beware of Surgical Complications" type="error">
The lecture explicitly warns: ***"Beware of surgical complications"*** [1]. The key message is that surgery is not risk-free, and given the evidence that ***"none of the above interventions were clinically superior"*** (MUA vs ACR vs early structured physiotherapy) [1] and ***"ACR with more adverse effects and MUA most cost-effective"*** [1], the decision to operate must weigh the marginal benefit against real risks. Conservative management remains first-line.
</Callout>

#### B4. Evidence: MUA vs Arthroscopic Release vs Physiotherapy

The lecture presents a landmark RCT [1]:

***"503 patients randomly assigned to 3 groups: MUA, arthroscopic capsular release (ACR), and early structured physiotherapy in ratio 2:2:1. MUA and ACR followed by post-op physio. Outcome was measured by Oxford Shoulder Score."*** [1]

***Conclusion: "None of the above interventions were clinically superior. ACR with more adverse effects and MUA most cost-effective."*** [1]

| Intervention | Efficacy | Adverse Effects | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MUA** | Equivalent | Moderate (fracture risk) | ***Most cost-effective*** |
| **ACR (Arthroscopic capsular release)** | Equivalent | ***More adverse effects*** | Higher (operating time, instruments) |
| **Early structured physiotherapy** | Equivalent | Minimal | Lowest |

**What does this mean clinically?** It reinforces that:
1. Physiotherapy is a valid standalone treatment even for refractory cases
2. If surgery is chosen, MUA may be preferred over ACR for cost-effectiveness with fewer complications
3. ACR should be reserved for cases where the pattern of tightness needs precise, controlled release (e.g., secondary pathology requiring concomitant treatment)

### C. Complications Unique to Secondary Frozen Shoulder

| Context | Specific Complications |
|---|---|
| **Post-mastectomy / axillary LN dissection** [3][4] | ***Shoulder dysfunction — restricted shoulder mobility*** [3]; lymphoedema of the ipsilateral arm (disrupted lymphatic drainage); nerve injuries: intercostobrachial nerve (medial arm numbness), thoracodorsal nerve (weakened adduction/IR), long thoracic nerve (winged scapula) [3]. These nerve injuries compound the frozen shoulder by further reducing active muscle function. |
| **Post-shoulder surgery** | Surgical inflammation → capsular fibrosis; hardware impingement; rotator cuff repair with prolonged immobilization → secondary stiffness |
| **Post-fracture (proximal humerus)** | Prolonged sling immobilization → capsular contracture; malunion with altered biomechanics → secondary impingement → stiffness |
| **Post-dislocation** [2] | Capsular damage from the dislocation itself + prolonged immobilization post-reduction → ***adhesive capsulitis*** (listed as a complication of shoulder dislocation) [2] |

| **ACR** | ***Axillary nerve injury (0.6%)*** | Inferior capsular release near nerve | Careful inferior release technique |
| **ACR** | ***Dislocation*** | Over-release → loss of static stabilizers | ***AVOID release too much*** |
| **ACR** | ***Superficial wound infection*** | Portal site contamination | Aseptic technique, prophylactic antibiotics |
