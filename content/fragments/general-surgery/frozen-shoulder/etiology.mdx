## 1. Definition

**Frozen shoulder** — also called **adhesive capsulitis** — literally tells you what happens:

- "Adhesive" = sticking together (Latin _adhaerēre_)
- "Capsulitis" = inflammation of the capsule (_capsula_ = small box/capsule, _-itis_ = inflammation)

> The glenohumeral joint capsule becomes inflamed, fibrosed, contracted, and adherent to the humeral head, resulting in a globally stiff shoulder.

**_Definition of frozen shoulder_** [1]:

- **_Loss of both active and passive ROM_**
- **_Symptom of true shoulder pain and night pain of insidious onset_**
- **_Painful restriction of active and passive movement, with passive movement limited to 100° elevation, external rotation < 30°, and internal rotation limited to L5 or less_** [1]

<Callout title="Key Defining Feature" type="error">
  The hallmark is restriction of BOTH active AND passive range of motion. If
  only active ROM is lost but passive is intact, think rotator cuff pathology
  (the motor is broken, not the joint). In frozen shoulder, the joint capsule
  itself is physically contracted — no matter who moves the arm (patient or
  examiner), it won't go further.
</Callout>

This distinguishes it from:

- **Rotator cuff tear**: loss of _active_ ROM only; _passive_ ROM intact (the capsule is fine, the tendon motor is broken)
- **Impingement**: painful arc in a specific range; passive ROM may be full at end-range

## 2. Epidemiology

**_Primary adhesive capsulitis_** [1]:

- **_3–5% of the general population_**
- **_Age 40–60_**
- **_More common in females_**
- **_More common in patients with diabetes: 10–20%_** _(Manske RC et al., 2008)_ [1]

**_Post-operative or post-traumatic shoulder stiffness_** [1]:

- **_11% incidence_** [1]

Additional epidemiological points:

- Bilateral involvement occurs in **up to 20–30%** of cases (often sequential, not simultaneous)
- Recurrence in the same shoulder is rare (< 5%), but the contralateral shoulder is frequently affected
- In diabetics, frozen shoulder tends to be **more severe, more bilateral, and more refractory** to treatment [2]
- The non-dominant arm is slightly more commonly affected
- In Hong Kong's ageing population with high diabetes prevalence (~10% of adults), frozen shoulder is an extremely common orthopaedic presentation

## 3. Anatomy and Function

### 3.1 The Glenohumeral Joint Capsule

The glenohumeral (GH) joint is the most mobile joint in the body — a ball-and-socket design that sacrifices stability for range. The glenoid fossa is shallow (covers only about one-third of the humeral head), so the **joint capsule and ligaments** are critical restraints.

The capsule is a fibrous envelope that attaches from the glenoid labrum to the anatomical neck of the humerus. It is normally loose and redundant (especially the inferior axillary recess fold), which allows the wide ROM.

### 3.2 Key Capsular and Ligamentous Structures

**_Patho-anatomy_** — the structures that contract in frozen shoulder [1]:

| Structure                                                  | Abbreviation       | What it limits                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **_Anterosuperior capsule (Rotator Interval, SGHL, CHL)_** | RI, SGHL, CHL      | **_Limits external rotation (ER) in the adducted shoulder_** |
| **_Anteroinferior capsule_**                               | IGHL anterior band | **_Limits ER in the abducted shoulder_**                     |
| **_Posterior capsule_**                                    | —                  | **_Limits internal rotation (IR)_**                          |
| **_Axillary recess (inferior capsule)_**                   | —                  | Limits abduction                                             |

Where:

- **RI** = Rotator Interval — the triangular gap between supraspinatus (superiorly) and subscapularis (inferiorly). Contains the CHL, SGHL, and the long head of biceps tendon. This is the **most commonly affected area** in frozen shoulder and is the target for intra-articular steroid injection.
- **SGHL** = Superior Glenohumeral Ligament
- **CHL** = Coracohumeral Ligament — runs from the coracoid process to the greater and lesser tuberosities, roofing over the rotator interval.
- **IGHL** = Inferior Glenohumeral Ligament — the most important static stabilizer of the GH joint.

**Why does frozen shoulder predominantly limit ER and IR?**
Because the anterosuperior capsule (RI/CHL/SGHL) contracts first and most severely → ER is the first and most limited movement. Posterior capsule contraction → limits IR. The inferior axillary recess also contracts → limits abduction. This pattern of **ER > IR > abduction/flexion** is the classic capsular pattern of the glenohumeral joint.

<Callout title="Capsular Pattern of the Shoulder">
The capsular pattern (described by Cyriax) for the glenohumeral joint is: **External Rotation > Abduction > Internal Rotation**. This means ER is the most restricted, followed by abduction, then IR. Any shoulder with this pattern of restriction should raise suspicion for a capsular process (i.e., frozen shoulder or GH arthritis).
</Callout>

### 3.3 Subacromial Space vs Glenohumeral Joint

Frozen shoulder is a **glenohumeral (intra-articular) capsular** problem — NOT a subacromial problem. The subacromial bursa sits _outside_ the joint capsule. This distinction matters for:

- Injection: steroid goes **intra-articular** (at the rotator interval), not subacromial
- Imaging: MRI shows **capsular thickening**, not bursitis
- Surgery: **capsular release** (intra-articular), not subacromial decompression

### 3.4 The Axillary Nerve

The axillary nerve (C5, C6) wraps around the surgical neck of the humerus and runs along the inferior capsule. It innervates the deltoid and teres minor, and supplies sensation to the regimental badge area. This nerve is at risk during:

- Manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA)
- Arthroscopic capsular release (especially inferior release)
- Any procedure involving the inferior capsule

## 4. Etiology

Frozen shoulder is classified as **primary (idiopathic)** or **secondary**.

### 4.1 Primary (Idiopathic) Frozen Shoulder

No identifiable precipitating cause. Associated conditions (risk factors) include:

| Risk Factor                            | Mechanism / Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

<Callout title="DM and Frozen Shoulder — Hong Kong Relevance" type="idea">
  Hong Kong has a diabetes prevalence of approximately 10% in the adult
  population. In any patient presenting with frozen shoulder, **always check
  HbA1c / fasting glucose** — it may be the first presentation of undiagnosed
  diabetes. Diabetic frozen shoulder is characteristically more severe, more
  bilateral, and more resistant to conservative treatment.

### 4.2 Secondary Frozen Shoulder

An identifiable intrinsic, extrinsic, or systemic cause leads to capsular contracture, usually through a period of immobility or inflammation [2]:

## 5. Pathophysiology

Understanding the pathophysiology explains every clinical feature:

### 5.1 The Fibrotic Cascade

1. **Inflammation (Freezing phase)**: The joint capsule — particularly the **rotator interval, CHL, and SGHL** — becomes inflamed. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) are released. Angiogenesis and synovial hypervascularity occur. This produces **pain** (especially at night, because inflammatory mediators peak nocturnally and the recumbent position may increase capsular pressure).

2. **Fibrosis and Contraction (Frozen phase)**: Fibroblasts differentiate into **myofibroblasts** (smooth-muscle-like contractile cells). Dense collagen (types I and III) is laid down. The capsule becomes thick, contracted, and adherent to the humeral head. The normally loose **axillary recess** (inferior fold) becomes obliterated. Pain subsides as inflammation resolves, but **stiffness** dominates.

3. **Remodeling (Thawing phase)**: Gradual collagen remodeling and capsular stretching occur. Myofibroblast apoptosis slowly allows the capsule to become more compliant. ROM gradually improves, though some patients may have permanent residual restriction.

### 5.2 MRI Correlates of Pathology

**_MRI findings_** [1]:

- **_CHL thickness > 4 mm_** _(normal ~2.7 mm; frozen shoulder ~4.1 mm)_ [1]
- **_Capsule thickness > 7 mm_** _(normal ~4.5 mm; frozen shoulder ~7.1 mm)_ [1]
- **_Smaller (obliterated) axillary recess_** [1]
- **_Other pathologies causing frozen shoulder_** — MRI also identifies secondary causes (rotator cuff tear, labral pathology, etc.) [1]

_(Mengiardi et al., Radiology, 2004)_ [1]

**Why is the CHL so important?** The CHL is the roof of the rotator interval and is the structure that most consistently thickens and contracts in frozen shoulder. It acts as a "check-rein" on external rotation. When it is thickened and fibrotic, ER is the most restricted movement — which is exactly what we see clinically.

### 5.3 Why Night Pain?

During the freezing phase, the capsule is actively inflamed. At night:

- Inflammatory cytokines follow a circadian pattern with nocturnal peaks
- Recumbent positioning may increase intra-articular pressure
- Loss of distraction forces (gravity) on the arm allows the inflamed capsule to compress
- Patients tend to lie on the affected side, directly compressing the joint

This combination produces the characteristic **night pain** that disrupts sleep — a hallmark of the freezing phase.

### 5.4 Why Diabetics Are Worse

In DM:

- **AGEs** (advanced glycation end-products) cross-link collagen → makes the capsule stiffer and more resistant to stretching
- Microangiopathy → impaired capsular blood supply → poor healing
- Altered immune response → prolonged/exaggerated inflammatory phase
- Result: **longer freezing phase, more severe stiffness, less response to conservative treatment, higher surgical intervention rates**

### 6.1 By Etiology

| Type                     | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary (Idiopathic)** | No identifiable precipitant; associated with DM, thyroid disease, etc.                       |
| **Secondary**            | Identifiable cause — intrinsic (shoulder pathology), extrinsic (trauma/surgery), or systemic |

### 6.2 By Phase (Temporal / Clinical Classification)

**_Three phases of adhesive capsulitis_** [1]:

| Phase          | Duration           | Predominant Feature                                                        | Pathology                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Freezing_** | **_2–9 months_**   | **_Onset of pain. As pain continues, ROM of affected shoulder decreases_** | Active synovial inflammation, hypervascular synovitis, early fibrosis |
| **_Frozen_**   | **_4–12 months_**  | **_Pain less, but stiffness_**                                             | Dense fibrosis and capsular contraction; inflammation subsiding       |
| **_Thawing_**  | **_12–24 months_** | **_Pain improving and ROM also improves_**                                 | Collagen remodeling, gradual capsular stretching                      |

**Total disease course**: Typically 1–3 years. Some textbooks quote "self-limiting in 2–3 years," but **up to 40% of patients have some residual restriction** that may not completely resolve spontaneously [2].

<Callout title="Phase Identification Matters for Management" type="error">
  The phase determines treatment: - **Freezing (pain-dominant)**: Analgesics,
  intra-articular steroid — the goal is to control inflammation and pain.
  Aggressive physiotherapy during this phase can WORSEN inflammation. -
  **Frozen/Thawing (stiffness-dominant)**: Physiotherapy (stretching,
  mobilization) — now the capsule is no longer acutely inflamed, so stretching
  is beneficial and tolerated. - Injecting steroid during the frozen/thawing
  phase has minimal benefit because there is little active inflammation left —
  it's all fibrosis.

| **Difficulty with overhead activities (reaching shelves)**                              | Loss of flexion and abduction due to inferior and anteroinferior capsular contraction                                                                                                             |

| **Difficulty with external rotation tasks (e.g., combing hair, reaching for seatbelt)** | Loss of external rotation due to anterosuperior capsular (RI/CHL/SGHL) contraction — typically the earliest and most severely restricted movement                                                 |
| **Gradual improvement over months**                                                     | Natural history: thawing phase with collagen remodeling                                                                                                                                           |

**Symptom evolution over time** — this is **characteristic** and helps differentiate frozen shoulder from other diagnoses [2]:

1. **Pain → Pain + Stiffness → Stiffness → Resolution** (or near-resolution)

### 7.2 Signs

| Sign                                                                                       | Pathophysiological Basis                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_↓ ROM in BOTH active AND passive movement_** [1][2]                                     | The capsule is physically contracted — it doesn't matter who moves the arm. This is THE defining sign.                                                                                                                                            |
| **_ER and IR most restricted_** [2]                                                        | Anterosuperior capsule (RI/CHL/SGHL) contracts → limits ER; posterior capsule contracts → limits IR. ER is typically the earliest and most severely affected.                                                                                     |
| **Flexion/abduction also restricted**                                                      | Inferior capsule (axillary recess) obliterated → limits abduction; overall capsular volume reduced → limits flexion                                                                                                                               |
| **_Passive movement limited to ≤ 100° elevation, ER < 30°, IR limited to L5 or less_** [1] | Specific thresholds used in the diagnostic definition                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Joint tenderness** [2]                                                                   | Capsular inflammation (especially during freezing phase); tenderness is often anterior (rotator interval region)                                                                                                                                  |
| **Muscle wasting (e.g., deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus)** [2]                       | Disuse atrophy — the patient guards the shoulder due to pain → muscle deconditioning. Duration of disease is typically months, which is enough for visible wasting.                                                                               |
| **Compensatory scapulothoracic motion**                                                    | The patient compensates for lost GH movement by shrugging/rotating the scapula. On examination, the scapula moves early during arm elevation (normally, the first 30° of abduction is purely GH). This is sometimes called **"scapular hiking."** |
| **No impingement signs (Neer, Hawkins negative)**                                          | These tests assess subacromial pathology, not capsular pathology. In pure frozen shoulder, they should be negative (though secondary frozen shoulder from SAIS may have positive impingement signs).                                              |
| **Normal strength (when tested within available ROM)**                                     | The rotator cuff muscles are intact; the problem is the capsule. However, testing may be limited by pain and restricted ROM.                                                                                                                      |

### 7.3 Important Clinical Pearl — Differentiating from Other Shoulder Pathology

| Feature       | Frozen Shoulder                        | Rotator Cuff Tear             | SAIS / Impingement                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Active ROM    | ↓↓↓                                    | ↓                             | ↓ (painful arc)                              |
| Passive ROM   | ↓↓↓ (= active)                         | **Intact**                    | Usually intact (may be painful at end-range) |
| Pattern       | Global (ER > ABD > IR)                 | Specific (depends on tendon)  | Painful arc 60–120°                          |
| Night pain    | Yes (freezing phase)                   | Yes (if large tear)           | Less common                                  |
| Special tests | Negative impingement                   | Drop arm sign, weakness       | Neer, Hawkins positive                       |
| Course        | Phases (pain → stiffness → resolution) | Progressive without treatment | Activity-related                             |

## 8. Investigations

Frozen shoulder is fundamentally a **clinical diagnosis**. Investigations serve to:

1. Confirm the diagnosis (MRI)
2. Exclude secondary causes (XR, MRI, blood tests)
3. Screen for associated conditions (HbA1c, TFTs)

| Investigation                               | Purpose / Findings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HbA1c / Fasting glucose** [2]             | Screen for diabetes — the strongest associated condition. May reveal undiagnosed DM.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **TFTs (Thyroid function tests)**           | Screen for thyroid disease (both hypo- and hyperthyroidism associated)                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **XR shoulder (AP + axillary lateral)** [2] | Usually **normal** in frozen shoulder. Purpose is to **exclude** other pathology: GH arthritis, calcific tendonitis, fracture, AC joint pathology, proximal migration of humeral head (rotator cuff arthropathy). May show osteopenia from disuse. |
| **_MRI shoulder_** [1][2]                   | **_CHL > 4 mm, capsule thickness > 7 mm, smaller axillary recess_** [1]. Also **rules out** secondary causes: rotator cuff tear, labral pathology, SAIS. Gold standard for evaluating capsular pathology.                                          |
| **Ultrasound shoulder**                     | Can show CHL thickening, reduced vascularity in chronic phase. Less sensitive than MRI. Dynamic assessment possible.                                                                                                                               |
| **Arthrography (historical)**               | Reduced joint capacity (< 10 mL vs normal ~15–20 mL). Rarely used purely diagnostically anymore, but distension arthrography is used therapeutically (hydrodilatation).                                                                            |

<Callout title="Must-Do Investigation">
  In any patient with frozen shoulder, **always check HbA1c**. Frozen shoulder
  may be the first presentation of diabetes. In Hong Kong, with a high
  prevalence of type 2 DM, this is a crucial screening opportunity. Missing this
  is an exam (and clinical) mistake.

## 9. Summary Table — Frozen Shoulder at a Glance

| Aspect       | Key Points                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Definition   | Loss of active + passive ROM; painful restriction with ER < 30°, elevation ≤ 100°, IR ≤ L5 |
| Epidemiology | 3–5% general population; age 40–60; F > M; DM 10–20%                                       |
| Strongest RF | Diabetes mellitus (AGEs cross-link capsular collagen)                                      |
| Pathology    | Capsular inflammation → fibrosis → contraction (especially RI/CHL/SGHL)                    |
| Phases       | Freezing (2–9 mo) → Frozen (4–12 mo) → Thawing (12–24 mo)                                  |
| Key sign     | Both active AND passive ROM restricted (capsular pattern: ER > ABD > IR)                   |
| MRI          | CHL > 4 mm, capsule > 7 mm, obliterated axillary recess                                    |
| Always check | HbA1c                                                                                      |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Frozen shoulder = adhesive capsulitis = loss of BOTH active AND passive ROM** — this is the single most important distinguishing feature (vs rotator cuff pathology where only active ROM is lost).

2. **Strongest risk factor is diabetes mellitus (10–20%).** Always check HbA1c. AGEs cross-link collagen → stiff, fibrotic capsule.

3. **Patho-anatomy**: Anterosuperior capsule (RI, SGHL, CHL) contracts → limits ER (earliest and most restricted). Posterior capsule → limits IR. Axillary recess obliterated → limits abduction.

4. **Three phases**: Freezing (pain, 2–9 mo) → Frozen (stiffness, 4–12 mo) → Thawing (improvement, 12–24 mo). **Phase determines treatment**: steroids for pain phase; PT for stiffness phase.

5. **MRI criteria**: CHL > 4 mm, capsule > 7 mm, smaller axillary recess.

6. **Diagnostic definition thresholds**: Elevation ≤ 100°, ER < 30°, IR limited to L5 or less.

7. **Secondary frozen shoulder**: Look for underlying cause (rotator cuff tear, post-surgery, post-trauma, axillary LN dissection).

8. **Night pain** is characteristic (inflammatory mediators peak nocturnally + recumbent positioning increases capsular pressure).

9. Up to **40% of patients** may have residual restriction — not always fully self-limiting.

10. In Hong Kong, high diabetes prevalence makes frozen shoulder a very common orthopaedic presentation.
