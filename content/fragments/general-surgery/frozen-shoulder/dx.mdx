## Diagnostic Criteria for Frozen Shoulder

### Why Frozen Shoulder is Primarily a Clinical Diagnosis

There is no single blood test, imaging finding, or pathological criterion that "confirms" frozen shoulder the way, say, the Jones criteria confirm rheumatic fever. Frozen shoulder is diagnosed **clinically** — by recognizing a characteristic pattern of symptoms, signs, and temporal evolution, then **excluding** other pathologies that mimic it. Investigations serve to support the diagnosis, exclude mimics, and identify underlying causes (especially DM).

Think of it this way: the capsule is contracted — you can *feel* this on examination (restricted passive ROM). No investigation tells you this better than your hands.

---

### Diagnostic Criteria

The diagnosis rests on satisfying ALL of the following:

***Definition of frozen shoulder*** [1]:
1. ***Loss of both active and passive ROM***
2. ***Symptom of true shoulder pain and night pain of insidious onset***
3. ***Painful restriction of active and passive movement, with passive movement limited to 100° elevation, external rotation < 30°, and internal rotation limited to L5 or less*** [1]

These thresholds are critical — let's understand why each matters:

| Criterion | Threshold | Why This Specific Value? |
|---|---|---|
| **Elevation (flexion/abduction)** | ***≤ 100°*** | Normal elevation is ~170–180°. The inferior capsule (axillary recess) and anteroinferior capsule contract → physically blocks elevation beyond ~100°. Losing nearly half of elevation indicates significant capsular contracture. |
| **External rotation** | ***< 30°*** | Normal ER is ~60–90°. The ***anterosuperior capsule (RI, SGHL, CHL)*** contracts earliest and most severely → ER is the first and most restricted movement. < 30° represents > 50% loss. [1] |
| **Internal rotation** | ***Limited to L5 or less*** | Normal IR allows the hand to reach T5–T7 (mid-thoracic spine). ***Posterior capsule*** contracts → limits IR. L5 means the patient can barely reach the low back — severe restriction. [1] |

<Callout title="Exam Tip — Know the Thresholds">
The specific numbers (elevation ≤ 100°, ER < 30°, IR ≤ L5) are directly from the lecture slides and are commonly tested. They also appear in the Robinson et al. (JBJS 2012) diagnostic algorithm used in the lecture. If a clinical vignette gives you ROM values, compare them against these thresholds.
</Callout>

### Additional Diagnostic Requirements

Beyond the ROM thresholds, you must confirm:

- **Insidious onset** — not acute (excludes fracture, acute rotator cuff tear, septic arthritis)
- **Night pain** — characteristic of the freezing phase (inflamed capsule)
- **Exclusion of other pathology** — normal XR (excludes OA, calcific tendonitis, fracture); negative impingement signs (excludes SAIS); no systemic signs (excludes infection)

### Physical Examination Findings — Localizing the Capsular Contracture

***Physical findings depend on which structures are involved*** [1]:

| Structure Involved | Movement Restricted | How to Test |
|---|---|---|
| ***Rotator interval*** | ***Limited ER in adducted arm*** | Arm at side (adducted), elbow at 90° → passively externally rotate. Compare with contralateral side. |
| ***Anteroinferior capsule*** | ***Limited ER in abducted arm*** | Arm abducted to 90° → passively externally rotate. If restricted here but not in adduction, the anteroinferior capsule (IGHL anterior band) is primarily involved. |
| ***Posterior capsule*** | ***Limited adduction and IR*** | Test passive IR (hand behind back) and cross-body adduction. |
| ***Extra-articular structures*** | ***Global stiffness*** | All movements restricted equally — suggests involvement beyond just the capsule (e.g., subacromial adhesions, deltoid fibrosis). |

**Why does this matter?** It matters for **surgical planning** — if only the anterior capsule is tight, you only need to release the anterior capsule/rotator interval. If everything is tight, you need a ***360° release*** [1]. More on this in the management section.

***Special tests to rule out other pathologies*** [1] — this is a crucial part of the diagnostic process:

| Test | Purpose | If Positive, Consider Instead |
|---|---|---|
| Neer's impingement sign | Subacromial impingement | SAIS — secondary frozen shoulder may co-exist |
| Hawkins sign | Subacromial impingement | SAIS |
| Drop arm test | Full-thickness rotator cuff tear | Rotator cuff tear (passive ROM should be intact) |
| Speed's test / Yergason test | Biceps tendinopathy | Biceps pathology |
| Cross-body adduction (Scarf test) | AC joint pathology | AC joint arthritis |
| Spurling's test | Cervical radiculopathy | Cervical spine pathology |
| Apprehension / relocation test | GH instability | Instability → secondary stiffness |

<Callout title="Important Clinical Principle" type="error">
A positive special test does NOT exclude frozen shoulder — it may indicate the **cause** of a secondary frozen shoulder. For example, a patient with SAIS (positive Neer/Hawkins) who guards their shoulder for months may develop secondary adhesive capsulitis. The frozen shoulder is then a complication of the impingement. You must treat BOTH the underlying cause AND the capsular contracture.
</Callout>

### Lecture Slide Clinical Vignette — Worked Example

The lecture slides present a case [1]:

***"Complained of right shoulder stiffness at 4 months, although physiotherapy all along"*** [1]

***ROM findings*** [1]:
- ***Limited in both active and passive direction***
- ***Forward flexion: 90°***
- ***Abduction: 90°***
- ***External rotation: 10°***
- ***Internal rotation: L3***

Let's apply the diagnostic criteria:
- Elevation (FF 90°, ABD 90°) → **≤ 100°** ✓
- ER 10° → **< 30°** ✓
- IR L3 → **≤ L5** ✓ (L3 is actually slightly better than L5 in terms of reaching higher, but note L3 is still well below normal T5–T7)
- Both active and passive restricted ✓
- Occurred post-operatively despite physiotherapy → ***Secondary adhesive capsulitis*** [1]

**Diagnosis: Secondary adhesive capsulitis** ✓

## Diagnostic Algorithm

The following algorithm is adapted from the ***Robinson CM et al., JBJS 2012*** algorithm presented in the lecture slides [1], combined with the updated 2025 stepwise approach [1].

### Updated 2025 Stepwise Approach (Lecture Slide)

The lecture slides also present a simplified updated pathway [1]:

    C -- "Yes" --> D["Continue physiotherapy"]

    G --> H["***Intensive physiotherapy***"]
```

<Callout title="Key Algorithm Points from Lecture Slides">

1. ***Physiotherapy is first-line for all types*** — trial for ***3 months*** (updated 2025) or ***6–12 weeks*** (Robinson 2012) [1]

2. ***If no response → step up to arthroscopic release + MUA*** [1]

3. ***Intraoperative injection: 40 mg triamcinolone and 2% lignocaine*** — triamcinolone (a potent long-acting corticosteroid) reduces post-operative inflammation; lignocaine provides immediate post-operative analgesia to facilitate early mobilization [1]

4. ***Intensive post-operative physiotherapy*** is essential — if the patient doesn't move early, the capsule will scar down again [1]

5. ***For secondary frozen shoulder: simultaneously treat the underlying cause*** (e.g., rotator cuff repair, treat DM) [1]

6. ***Surgical decision depends on pattern of tightness***: anterior capsule tight only → rotator interval/anterior release; A/P capsule tight → ***360° release*** [1]

</Callout>

## Investigation Modalities

Investigations in frozen shoulder serve three purposes:
1. **Confirm the diagnosis** (support clinical findings)
2. **Exclude mimics** (OA, rotator cuff tear, calcific tendonitis, fracture, infection, tumour)
3. **Screen for associated conditions** (DM, thyroid disease)

### Blood Investigations

| Investigation | Purpose | Key Findings / Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **HbA1c / Fasting glucose** [2] | Screen for DM — the strongest associated condition | HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or FG ≥ 7.0 mmol/L = diabetes. HbA1c 5.7–6.4% = prediabetes. Finding DM changes management (diabetic frozen shoulder is more refractory, may need earlier surgical intervention). |
| **Thyroid function tests (TFTs)** | Screen for thyroid disease | TSH ↑ with low fT4 = hypothyroidism; TSH ↓ with high fT3/fT4 = hyperthyroidism. Both associated with frozen shoulder (altered connective tissue metabolism). |
| **FBC, CRP, ESR** | Exclude infection / inflammatory arthritis | Should be normal in frozen shoulder. If elevated → consider septic arthritis, inflammatory arthropathy (RA, crystal arthropathy). |
| **Urate, RF, Anti-CCP** | If inflammatory arthritis suspected | Gout, RA as secondary causes of shoulder stiffness |
| **Fasting lipid profile** | Screen for hyperlipidaemia | Associated risk factor; also part of cardiovascular risk assessment in a patient likely to have DM |

<Callout title="Always Check HbA1c" type="error">
This cannot be overstated. In Hong Kong, with ~10% diabetes prevalence in adults, frozen shoulder may be the **presenting complaint** of undiagnosed type 2 DM. Missing this is both a clinical and exam mistake. The management algorithm from the lecture specifically separates ***diabetic frozen shoulder*** as a distinct category [1] — you cannot categorize the patient correctly without knowing their glycaemic status.
</Callout>

### Imaging Investigations

#### 1. Plain Radiograph (XR Shoulder)

**Views**: AP (in internal and external rotation) + axillary lateral (or Y-view)

**Purpose**: ***Rule out AC pathology*** [2] and other bony/articular causes of stiffness

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| **Normal** | Supports diagnosis of frozen shoulder (expected finding) |
| Joint space narrowing + osteophytes + subchondral sclerosis | GH osteoarthritis — NOT frozen shoulder |
| Calcification in supraspinatus tendon | Calcific tendonitis — may co-exist or be a cause of secondary stiffness |
| ↓ Acromiohumeral distance ( < 7 mm) | Proximal migration of humeral head → rotator cuff arthropathy (massive cuff tear) |
| Fracture | Post-traumatic stiffness, not primary frozen shoulder |
| Osteolysis of distal clavicle | AC joint pathology |
| Osteopenia of humeral head | Disuse osteopenia — supports prolonged immobility (seen in chronic frozen shoulder) |
| Bony lesion (lytic/sclerotic) | Tumour, metastasis — red flag |

**Why do we get XR if it's usually normal?** Because the consequences of missing OA, fracture, tumour, or calcific tendonitis are significant. XR is cheap, quick, and widely available. It is a **screening/exclusion** tool, not a confirmation tool.

#### 2. MRI Shoulder

**The key confirmatory imaging modality** — also the gold standard for evaluating capsular pathology and excluding secondary causes.

***MRI Findings in frozen shoulder*** [1]:

| Finding | Threshold | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| ***CHL thickness*** | ***> 4 mm*** *(normal ~2.7 mm; frozen shoulder ~4.1 mm)* | The CHL is the "check-rein" on ER. Thickening here is the most consistent MRI sign. It correlates with severity of ER restriction. |
| ***Capsule thickness*** | ***> 7 mm*** *(normal ~4.5 mm; frozen shoulder ~7.1 mm)* | Diffuse capsular thickening — reflects the fibrotic process throughout the joint capsule |
| ***Smaller axillary recess*** | Reduced volume / obliterated | The axillary recess is the inferior redundant fold of capsule that normally allows abduction. When it's obliterated by fibrosis, abduction is physically blocked. |
| Capsular enhancement (gadolinium) | Increased enhancement in freezing phase | Active inflammation with hypervascularity — corresponds to the freezing (pain) phase. Less enhancement in the frozen/thawing phases. |
| Rotator interval thickening/fibrosis | Obliteration of the fat triangle in the RI | The RI fat normally appears as a bright triangle on T1-weighted images. In frozen shoulder, this is replaced by thickened, fibrotic tissue. |
| ***Other pathologies causing frozen shoulder*** [1] | Rotator cuff tear, labral tear, SAIS, etc. | MRI simultaneously evaluates for secondary causes — this is why it's the preferred advanced imaging modality |

*(Mengiardi et al., Radiology, 2004)* [1]

**Why is MRI not always necessary?**
- If the clinical picture is classic (typical history, capsular pattern of restriction, risk factors present, normal XR), MRI may not change management
- MRI is most useful when:
  - The diagnosis is uncertain
  - Secondary frozen shoulder is suspected (need to identify the underlying cause)
  - Pre-operative planning (before arthroscopic release — need to know what else is going on in the joint)
  - Medicolegal context (post-traumatic/post-surgical cases)

#### 3. Ultrasound (USG Shoulder)

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| CHL thickening ( > 4 mm) | Supports diagnosis — but less sensitive/specific than MRI |
| Increased vascularity on Doppler | Active inflammation (freezing phase) |
| Normal rotator cuff tendons | Helps exclude rotator cuff tear as a cause |
| Dynamic assessment | Can assess real-time movement restriction; detects impingement dynamically |

**Advantages**: No radiation, cheaper than MRI, widely available, allows dynamic assessment.
**Disadvantages**: Operator-dependent, cannot assess deep structures (labrum, posterior capsule) as well as MRI, limited soft tissue contrast.

#### 4. Arthrography (Historical / Therapeutic)

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| Reduced joint capacity ( < 10 mL vs normal 15–20 mL) | Contracted capsule — classic finding. Historically used for diagnosis. |
| Obliterated axillary recess | Inferior capsule contracted |
| Irregular capsular filling | Adhesions |

**Now primarily therapeutic** — distension arthrography (hydrodilatation) involves injecting a volume of saline + steroid + local anaesthetic under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance to physically distend and rupture the contracted capsule. It is used in the Robinson algorithm as a treatment step for cases not responding to physiotherapy [1].

#### 5. Arthroscopy (Diagnostic + Therapeutic)

Not used purely for diagnosis, but intraoperative findings confirm:
- Thickened, inflamed synovium (especially at rotator interval)
- Contracted capsule with reduced joint volume
- Adhesions in the axillary recess
- Rule out or treat concomitant pathology (labral tear, loose bodies, rotator cuff tear)

### Investigation Summary Table

| Investigation | When to Order | Key Finding in Frozen Shoulder | Primary Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HbA1c** | **Always** | May reveal undiagnosed DM | Screen for DM |
| **TFTs** | Always | May reveal thyroid disease | Screen for thyroid |
| **FBC, CRP, ESR** | If infection/inflammation suspected | Normal in frozen shoulder | Exclude septic arthritis / inflammatory arthritis |
| **XR shoulder** [2] | **Always (first-line imaging)** | Usually **normal** | Exclude OA, fracture, calcification, tumour |
| ***MRI shoulder*** [1][2] | If diagnosis uncertain, secondary cause suspected, or pre-operative | ***CHL > 4 mm, capsule > 7 mm, smaller axillary recess*** | Confirm capsular pathology, identify secondary causes |
| **USG shoulder** | Alternative to MRI; if rotator cuff tear suspected | CHL thickening, normal cuff | Dynamic assessment, exclude cuff tear |
| **Arthrography** | Therapeutic (hydrodilatation) | Reduced joint capacity < 10 mL | Therapeutic distension |

<Callout title="Investigation Approach — First Principles">
Think of it in order:
1. **Blood tests first** — HbA1c (always), TFTs, inflammatory markers if needed
2. **XR shoulder** — quick, cheap, excludes bony pathology (the "screening" step)
3. **MRI shoulder** — if diagnosis uncertain, secondary cause suspected, or pre-operative planning (the "definitive" step)

The diagnosis is CLINICAL. Investigations support, exclude, and screen — they don't make the diagnosis.

### Distinguishing Primary vs Secondary Frozen Shoulder — Investigation Approach

| | Primary (Idiopathic) | Secondary |
|---|---|---|
| **History** | No precipitant; risk factors (DM, thyroid, female, 40–60) | Identifiable precipitant (trauma, surgery, rotator cuff disease) |
| **XR** | Normal | May show calcification, cuff arthropathy, post-surgical changes |
| **MRI** | Capsular thickening only | Capsular thickening + underlying pathology (cuff tear, labral tear, etc.) |
| **Blood tests** | HbA1c may be elevated (undiagnosed DM) | Depends on cause |
| **Management implication** | Treat the frozen shoulder | ***Simultaneous treatment of underlying cause*** [1] |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Diagnosis of Frozen Shoulder">

1. **Frozen shoulder is a clinical diagnosis** based on: insidious onset of shoulder pain + night pain + restriction of BOTH active AND passive ROM with elevation ≤ 100°, ER < 30°, IR ≤ L5.

2. **Physical findings depend on which capsular structures are involved**: RI → limited ER in adduction; anteroinferior → limited ER in abduction; posterior → limited IR and adduction; extra-articular → global stiffness.

3. **Special tests are used to EXCLUDE other pathologies** (Neer/Hawkins for impingement, Drop arm for cuff tear, Speed/Yergason for biceps, Scarf test for ACJ, Spurling for cervical radiculopathy).

4. **Always order**: HbA1c (screen DM), XR shoulder (exclude bony pathology). Order MRI if diagnosis uncertain or secondary cause suspected.

5. **MRI criteria**: CHL > 4 mm, capsule > 7 mm, smaller axillary recess (Mengiardi et al., 2004).

6. **Diagnostic algorithm (Robinson 2012 / Updated 2025)**: Physiotherapy trial (3 months) → if no response → classify (diabetic / primary / secondary) → distension arthrography or step up → if no response → operative (MUA / arthroscopic release based on pattern of tightness: anterior only vs 360°).

7. **For secondary frozen shoulder**: must identify AND simultaneously treat the underlying cause.

8. **XR is usually normal** in frozen shoulder — that's the expected finding. Its role is exclusion, not confirmation.
