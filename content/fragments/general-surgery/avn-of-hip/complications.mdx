## Complications of AVN of the Hip

Complications of AVN fall into two broad categories: **(A) complications of the disease itself** (untreated or progressing AVN) and **(B) complications of treatment** (surgical interventions). Let's work through both systematically, always explaining *why* each complication occurs from first principles.

---

### A. Complications of the Disease Process

These are the consequences of AVN progressing through its natural history — from silent necrosis to femoral head collapse and secondary joint destruction.

#### 1. Subchondral Fracture and Femoral Head Collapse

This is the **cardinal complication** and the defining event that separates "salvageable" from "non-salvageable" disease.

- **Why it happens**: During the repair phase, osteoclasts resorb dead trabeculae in the subchondral zone faster than osteoblasts can replace them. This creates a zone of **structural weakness** just beneath the articular surface. Continued weight-bearing transmits compressive forces through this weak zone, and the subchondral plate fractures — visible as the ***crescent sign (subchondral collapse of the necrotic segment)*** [1].
- **Consequence**: Once the subchondral plate gives way, the overlying articular cartilage (which was initially normal because it gets nutrition from synovial fluid, not from bone) collapses inward. The femoral head loses its spherical contour. This is **irreversible** — no joint-preserving treatment can restore the round shape.
- **Clinical significance**: Marks the transition from Ficat II to Ficat III. Management shifts from core decompression/bone graft to THR consideration.

#### 2. Secondary Osteoarthritis

***Late Complications — Secondary OA: Pain due to joint incongruency and chondral damage*** [1]

- **Why it happens**: Once the femoral head collapses and loses its spherical shape, the articulation with the acetabulum becomes **incongruent**. An incongruent joint distributes load unevenly — focal areas of high contact pressure develop, accelerating cartilage wear on both the femoral and acetabular surfaces. This is classical **secondary OA** (same LOSS features on X-ray: loss of joint space, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cysts).
- **Clinical features**: Progressive pain worsened by activity, crepitus, reduced range of motion, eventually end-stage fixed flexion deformity with Trendelenburg gait [2].
- **This is Ficat Stage IV** — the endpoint of untreated AVN. ***Treatment: THR*** [1].

<Callout title="Key Concept">
AVN and secondary OA are on a continuum. AVN is the "upstream" pathology; secondary OA is the "downstream" consequence. Preventing femoral head collapse (early detection + joint-preserving treatment) is the key to preventing secondary OA.
</Callout>

#### 3. Stiffness and Contracture

***Late Complications — Stiffness due to ankylosis and soft tissue contracture (flexion and adduction contracture)*** [1]

- **Why it happens**: Chronic pain causes the patient to hold the hip in the position of maximal comfort — slight **flexion and adduction** (which relaxes the hip capsule and reduces intracapsular pressure). Over time, the capsule, ligaments, and periarticular muscles adapt to this position by **fibrosing and shortening** — a process called adaptive contracture.
- **Flexion contracture**: The iliofemoral ligament (the strongest ligament in the body) and the anterior capsule shorten. The hip cannot fully extend. Detected by **Thomas' test** (flex the contralateral hip to flatten the lumbar lordosis; the affected hip rises off the bed).
- **Adduction contracture**: The adductor muscles and medial capsule shorten. The hip cannot abduct. This creates **apparent leg length discrepancy** (the affected limb appears shorter because the pelvis tilts to compensate for the fixed adduction).
- **Ankylosis**: In severe long-standing cases, fibrous or even bony ankylosis may develop (particularly in post-infectious settings), rendering the joint completely immobile.

#### 4. Deformity

***Late Complications — Deformity: angulation, coxa vara, shortening*** [1]

- **Angulation**: Collapse of the femoral head causes the articular surface to tilt, altering the normal alignment between the femoral neck and shaft.
- **Coxa vara**: The neck-shaft angle decreases (normal ~125°; coxa vara < 120°). This occurs because the weight-bearing dome of the femoral head collapses preferentially (it is the most ischaemically vulnerable zone), effectively shortening the superolateral aspect of the head relative to the inferomedial aspect. Coxa vara reduces the abductor lever arm → **worsens Trendelenburg gait**.
- **Shortening**: Femoral head collapse means the effective length of the affected limb is reduced — true leg length discrepancy (measured from ASIS to medial malleolus). In severe cases, several centimetres of shortening can occur, requiring a shoe raise or contributing to the indication for THR.

#### 5. Instability and Dislocation

***Late Complications — Instability, dislocation*** [1]

- **Why it happens**: The normal hip is a **ball-and-socket** joint — the spherical femoral head sits congruently in the deep acetabulum. When the femoral head collapses and becomes non-spherical, it no longer conforms to the acetabular socket. The "ball" doesn't fit the "socket" anymore → **reduced inherent stability**. Soft tissue contractures may also alter the balance of forces around the joint.
- **Clinical significance**: While frank dislocation of the native hip due to AVN alone is uncommon (unlike traumatic dislocation), **subluxation** and a sense of instability during certain movements can occur, particularly if there is also capsular laxity from underlying connective tissue disease (e.g., SLE).

#### 6. Leg Length Discrepancy

***Late Complications — Leg length discrepancy*** [1]

- **Why it happens**: Two mechanisms:
  1. **True shortening**: Femoral head collapse physically reduces the distance from the acetabulum to the femoral shaft → the affected leg is truly shorter
  2. **Apparent shortening**: Fixed adduction contracture tilts the pelvis down on the affected side, making the leg *appear* shorter even though the bony length may be equal
- **Clinical consequence**: Gait asymmetry, compensatory lumbar scoliosis, low back pain, difficulty with footwear, functional impairment

#### 7. Contralateral Hip Involvement

- **Why it happens**: In non-traumatic AVN, the **systemic risk factors** (steroids, alcohol, SLE, sickle cell) affect both femoral heads equally. The contralateral hip may be at a slightly different stage of disease progression.
- **Incidence**: 40–80% in atraumatic AVN
- **Clinical significance**: This is why ***MRI of contralateral hip*** [1] is essential at diagnosis — catching early contralateral disease allows timely intervention before collapse.

#### 8. Pathological Fracture

- In advanced AVN with extensive necrosis and weakened bone stock, a pathological fracture through the femoral neck can occur with minimal or no trauma
- Distinguished from a primary femoral neck fracture by the pre-existing AVN changes on imaging

### B. Complications of Treatment

#### 1. Complications of Core Decompression

| Complication | Mechanism | Incidence |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Subtrochanteric fracture** | The drill tract weakens the lateral femoral cortex. If the hole is too large or the patient bears weight too early, the cortex can fracture through the drill site. | ~1–2% |
| **Haematoma / bleeding** | Drilling through vascular bone → intramedullary bleeding | Mild, self-limiting |
| **Infection** | Any surgical procedure carries infection risk; the drill tract provides a portal of entry | Rare (< 1%) |
| **Progression despite treatment** | Core decompression fails to halt disease — the necrotic lesion was too large, or the repair response was insufficient. The femoral head still collapses. | 20–50% (especially Ficat II, large lesions) |
| **Heterotopic ossification** | Abnormal bone formation in surrounding soft tissues triggered by surgical trauma | Uncommon |

#### 2. Complications of Bone Graft (Including FVFG)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **Donor site morbidity** (for autograft/FVFG) | Iliac crest harvest: pain, haematoma, nerve injury (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve → meralgia paraesthetica). Fibula harvest: ankle instability (if too much fibula is taken), peroneal nerve injury, wound complications |
| **Graft non-incorporation / resorption** | The graft may fail to integrate with host bone — particularly in large necrotic zones with poor vascularity |
| **Microsurgical failure** (FVFG) | Thrombosis of the vascular pedicle → the graft loses its blood supply and dies → procedure fails. Risk factors: smoking, thrombophilia, technical error |
| **Persistent AVN progression** | Even with a successful graft, the disease may continue to progress if the necrotic zone is extensive or systemic risk factors persist |

#### 3. Complications of Total Hip Replacement

This is the most high-yield section for exams. THR complications can be classified by timing:

***Post-operative complications*** [3]:

##### Immediate (Intra-operative / First 24 Hours)

- ***Bleeding*** [3] — The hip is a deep, well-vascularised area. Blood loss during THR averages 300–500 mL. Excessive bleeding may require transfusion.
- ***Infection*** [3] — Intra-operative contamination. The prosthesis provides a foreign body surface for bacterial biofilm formation. **This is one of the most devastating complications** because infection of a prosthetic joint is extremely difficult to eradicate (see below).
- ***Leg length discrepancies*** [3] — If the prosthetic components are not positioned at the correct level, one leg may end up longer or shorter than the other. This must be ***counselled to patients beforehand*** [5] as even with careful planning, small discrepancies (~5–10 mm) are common.
- ***Neurovascular injury*** [3] — Depends on surgical approach:
  - **Posterior approach**: ***Sciatic nerve injury*** [2] — the sciatic nerve runs behind the hip joint and is vulnerable to stretching, compression, or direct injury during posterior capsulotomy. Clinical features: foot drop (common peroneal division more vulnerable), numbness in sciatic distribution.
  - **Anterolateral approach**: ***Superior gluteal nerve injury*** [2] — this nerve runs between gluteus medius and minimus. Damage causes **abductor weakness** → persistent Trendelenburg gait.
- ***Bone fracture*** [5] — Intra-operative periprosthetic fracture, especially during uncemented stem insertion (press-fitting requires controlled force; osteoporotic bone can crack).

##### Early (Days to Weeks)

- ***DVT / PE (thromboembolism)*** [2][5] — The triad of **Virchow** is fully activated during THR: (1) stasis (immobility post-operatively), (2) endothelial damage (surgical trauma), (3) hypercoagulability (surgical stress response). DVT can propagate proximally → PE, which is potentially fatal.
  - **Prevention**: Chemical (LMWH, rivaroxaban, aspirin) + mechanical (TED stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression, early mobilisation)
  - **Why hip surgery specifically?** The femoral vein lies in close proximity to the surgical field, and intra-operative manipulation of the limb can compress or damage the deep veins.

- ***Infection (early)*** [5] — ***Difficult to detect and treat*** [5]. Presents with wound erythema, discharge, fever, elevated CRP/WBC. Organisms: *Staphylococcus aureus* (most common acute), *Staphylococcus epidermidis* (early biofilm former). Treatment: debridement, IV antibiotics, potentially exchange of polyethylene liner while retaining well-fixed components (DAIR — Debridement, Antibiotics, Implant Retention).

##### Late (Months to Years)

- ***Joint dislocation*** [2][3] — The prosthetic head can dislocate from the acetabular cup. More common with the **posterior approach** (because the posterior capsule and short external rotators are divided). Prevented by ***avoiding squatting, crossing legs, flexing hip > 90°; abduction pillow; high-low chair*** [3].
  - **Why these precautions?** The posterior approach disrupts the posterior restraints. Hip flexion > 90° + adduction + internal rotation is the "dislocation position" — exactly the motion of squatting, bending to tie shoelaces, or crossing legs. The abduction pillow prevents inadvertent adduction during sleep.

- ***Prosthesis infection (periprosthetic joint infection — PJI)*** [2][3] — **The dreaded late complication**. Bacteria form a **biofilm** on the prosthetic surface — a polysaccharide matrix that protects bacteria from both the immune system and antibiotics. Once biofilm is established, antibiotics alone cannot eradicate the infection.
  - **Sources**: Haematogenous seeding (from dental procedures, UTI, skin infections, pneumonia), direct inoculation at surgery, contiguous spread
  - **Management**: Usually requires **two-stage revision** — removal of all prosthetic components + insertion of an antibiotic-loaded cement spacer + 6 weeks IV antibiotics → re-implantation of new prosthesis once infection is cleared. This is a prolonged, debilitating process.

- **Aseptic loosening** — The most common cause of long-term THR failure. Particulate wear debris (polyethylene, metal, or ceramic particles) is phagocytosed by macrophages, which release **inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6)** and **RANKL**, activating osteoclasts → periprosthetic osteolysis → loosening of the implant from the bone. Presents as progressive pain, often with X-ray evidence of radiolucent lines around the components.

- **Periprosthetic fracture** — Fracture of the femur around or adjacent to the prosthetic stem, typically after a fall. More common with uncemented stems (stress risers at the stem tip) and in osteoporotic bone.

- ***Leg length discrepancy*** [5] — Even after careful intra-operative measurement, some patients notice a difference. May require shoe raises. Must be ***counselled beforehand*** [5].

<Callout title="Why Is Prosthetic Infection So Feared?" type="error">
Bacteria on prosthetic surfaces form **biofilms** — structured communities encased in an extracellular polysaccharide matrix. Within the biofilm, bacteria exist in a **sessile, metabolically quiescent state**, making them 100–1000x more resistant to antibiotics compared to free-floating (planktonic) bacteria. The biofilm also shields bacteria from neutrophils and macrophages. This is why IV antibiotics alone cannot cure PJI — you must physically remove the prosthesis (and its biofilm) to eradicate the infection.
</Callout>

#### 4. Complications of Bisphosphonate Therapy

***Bisphosphonates (but associated with ONJ)*** [6]

- **Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)**: Bisphosphonates suppress osteoclast activity throughout the skeleton, including the jaw. The jaw has high bone turnover (constant remodelling from dental loading). Excessive osteoclast suppression impairs the jaw's ability to repair microdamage from dental procedures → exposed, necrotic bone in the mandible/maxilla. Risk factors: IV bisphosphonates (higher risk than oral), dental extraction, poor oral hygiene. Prevention: dental clearance before starting bisphosphonates.
- **Atypical femoral fracture**: Prolonged bisphosphonate use (> 5 years) can cause over-suppression of bone remodelling → accumulation of microdamage → **stress fracture of the subtrochanteric/femoral shaft** (characteristically **transverse** with lateral cortical beaking). Ironically, a drug used to treat AVN can cause a different type of femoral fracture. ***Bisphosphonate-related fractures: classically transverse fracture of proximal femur*** [7].
- **GI side effects (oral bisphosphonates)**: Oesophagitis, oesophageal ulceration (the tablet is acidic and can damage oesophageal mucosa). Prevention: take with a full glass of water, remain upright for 30 minutes.

### C. Complications in Specific Contexts

#### Post-Traumatic AVN (After Femoral Neck Fracture or Hip Dislocation)

- ***Hip dislocation complications: AVN (fracture-dislocation highest risk)*** [4]
- ***Displaced intracapsular #NOF (Garden III/IV): high risk of AVN (> 95%) — disruption of blood supply from MCFA*** [8]
- In young patients who undergo internal fixation to salvage the femoral head, post-traumatic AVN may develop **months to years later** — these patients need long-term follow-up with serial X-rays ± MRI
- Non-union is another complication that co-occurs with AVN (both are consequences of disrupted blood supply to the femoral head)

#### Perthes Disease Complications (Paediatric AVN)

- **Femoral head deformity**: If the femoral head is not contained during the fragmentation/reossification phase, it remodels into a non-spherical (coxa magna, coxa plana) shape → **secondary OA in adulthood**
- **Limb length discrepancy**: Damage to the proximal femoral physis impairs growth → true shortening
- **Loss of ROM**: Particularly abduction and internal rotation, persisting into adulthood
- **Secondary OA**: The long-term consequence in patients with residual femoral head deformity — may require THR decades later

#### DDH Treatment-Related AVN

***Complications of Pavlik harness: AVN — impingement of MCFA; avoid extreme abduction (> 60°)*** [9]

- **Why?** The Pavlik harness holds the hip in abduction and flexion. If abduction exceeds ~60°, the femoral head is forced laterally against the labrum, compressing the MCFA where it runs along the posterosuperior femoral neck. This iatrogenic vascular compromise can cause AVN of the femoral head in an infant — a devastating complication in a developing hip.
- Similarly, ***closed reduction with hip spica cast — avoid extreme abduction (> 60°): risk of AVN*** [9].

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **The major complication of AVN itself is femoral head collapse → secondary OA.** This is the natural endpoint of untreated disease and the reason we try to detect AVN early (pre-collapse = salvageable).

2. **Late complications of AVN** (from the lecture): **Secondary OA** (joint incongruency), **stiffness** (flexion and adduction contracture), **deformity** (angulation, coxa vara, shortening), **instability/dislocation**, and **leg length discrepancy**.

3. **THR complications**: Immediate — bleeding, fracture, neurovascular injury, infection. Early — DVT/PE, wound infection. Late — dislocation, prosthesis infection (biofilm!), aseptic loosening, periprosthetic fracture, leg length discrepancy.

4. **Prosthetic joint infection** is the most feared complication — biofilm on prosthetic surfaces renders bacteria 100–1000x more antibiotic-resistant. Usually requires two-stage revision.

5. **Bisphosphonate complications**: ONJ (suppress jaw bone remodelling) and atypical femoral fractures (transverse subtrochanteric fractures from over-suppressed remodelling).

6. **40–80% of atraumatic AVN is bilateral** — always screen the contralateral hip.

7. **In paediatric DDH treatment**: Avoid extreme abduction > 60° — compresses MCFA → iatrogenic AVN.
