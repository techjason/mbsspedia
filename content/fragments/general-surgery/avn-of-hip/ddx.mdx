## Differential Diagnosis of AVN of the Hip

When a patient walks into clinic with **hip pain**, you need a systematic framework. The learning outcome from the lecture is clear: ***Formulate differential diagnosis for patients with hip pain*** [1]. AVN is just one cause of hip pain — and conversely, a patient you *think* has AVN may actually have something else entirely. Let's work through this logically.

### Approach to the Differential Diagnosis

The key principle is to think **anatomically** — where is the pain coming from? — and then **by pathological process** (degenerative, inflammatory, infective, traumatic, neoplastic, referred).

Remember two golden rules:
1. ***Pain can be referred to the knee from other sites, most notably the ipsilateral hip. Every patient with knee pain should have a careful examination of the hip*** [5] — and vice versa.
2. Hip pain that is actually **referred from the lumbar spine** (L2-4 dermatomes overlap with the hip region) is extremely common and must always be considered.

### Detailed Differential Diagnoses

#### A. Intra-articular Causes (Groin / Deep Hip Pain)

##### 1. Osteoarthritis of the Hip

This is the **most common cause of chronic hip pain** in the elderly and the condition AVN most closely mimics (and eventually becomes).

- ***Secondary OA hip is more common in Chinese population*** [2] — ***primary/idiopathic OA is uncommon in Chinese population*** [1]
- ***Secondary causes include: trauma, infection, inflammatory joint diseases (e.g. RA), crystal deposition diseases (e.g. gout), neuropathic (e.g. Charcot joint), metabolic/endocrine*** [1]
- **How to distinguish from AVN**: OA is typically in patients > 60 years with gradual onset. X-ray shows the classic **LOSS** features (***Loss of joint space, Osteophytes, Subchondral sclerosis, Subchondral cysts***) [4]. AVN in early stages shows sclerosis and crescent sign *without* osteophytes or joint space narrowing — the femoral head shape changes *before* the joint space narrows. In late-stage AVN (Ficat IV), however, it looks identical to secondary OA.
- ***Clinical features***: Hip pain radiating to knee, aggravated by weight-bearing and improved with rest, morning stiffness, externally rotated limb, antalgic gait, end-stage fixed flexion deformity with Trendelenburg gait [2]
- ***DDx of OA hip itself includes: fractures, sciatica, trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius tendinopathy*** [2]

<Callout title="Key Distinguishing Point">
**AVN vs Primary OA**: AVN typically affects **younger patients (20–50y)** with identifiable risk factors (steroids, alcohol, SLE, trauma). Primary OA affects **older patients (> 60y)**. On X-ray, AVN shows femoral head changes (sclerosis, crescent sign, collapse) with *initially preserved joint space*, while OA shows joint space narrowing as the earliest feature. MRI with the **double line sign** is pathognomonic for AVN.
</Callout>

##### 2. Fracture Neck of Femur (#NOF)

- A critical diagnosis not to miss, especially in the elderly after a fall
- **Why it mimics AVN**: Both cause groin pain worsened by internal rotation. However, #NOF is **acute onset** after trauma (or insidious in stress/insufficiency fractures), while AVN is insidious
- ***Clinical features***: Pain in groin/thigh or referred to knee, exacerbated by **internal rotation** (most sensitive) and axial loading; ***shortened, abducted and externally rotated leg*** [3]
- ***X-ray***: ***Disrupted Shenton's line***, fracture line visible [3]
- **The link**: Displaced intracapsular #NOF (***Garden III/IV***) carries a ***> 95% risk of AVN*** due to disruption of the MCFA [3] — so #NOF is both a differential diagnosis AND a cause of AVN
- ***Intracapsular fractures carry high AVN risk; extracapsular fractures carry low AVN risk*** [3]

##### 3. Septic Arthritis of the Hip

An **orthopaedic emergency** — if you miss this, the joint is destroyed.

- **Why it mimics AVN**: Both cause hip pain with reduced ROM. However, septic arthritis is **acute** with systemic features (fever, malaise)
- ***Investigations***: ***WBC, CRP, ESR, image-guided hip aspiration (cell count, Gram smear, bacterial/fungal/AFB cultures, ± crystals), blood cultures, imaging*** [1]
- ***Imaging***: ***X-rays may show soft-tissue swelling or hip joint capsular distension (with widening of the joint space or even subluxation); radiographic changes in the proximal femoral metaphysis suggest osteomyelitis. MRI may be the most useful test to distinguish proximal femoral osteomyelitis from septic arthritis of the hip. Radioisotope scan*** [1]
- ***Treatment***: ***Antibiotics AFTER joint fluid/synovium are obtained for culture unless haemodynamic instability. Early initiation of antibiotics before obtaining specimens has risk of negative culture → affects antibiotic regime. Surgical drainage — anterior approach in young to preserve blood supply; posterior approach when hip destruction not salvageable and replacement needed. Surgical drainage with antibiotic cement spacer*** [1]
- **The link**: Septic arthritis can itself cause AVN (elevated intra-articular pressure compresses retinacular vessels; bacterial toxins damage endothelium → thrombosis)

| Feature | AVN | Septic Arthritis |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Onset | Insidious | Acute (hours to days) |
| Fever | Absent | Present (often high-grade) |
| CRP/ESR/WBC | Normal (unless underlying cause) | Markedly elevated |
| Joint aspirate | Non-inflammatory | Purulent (WCC > 50,000, > 75% PMN) |
| X-ray | Sclerosis, crescent sign | Soft tissue swelling, joint space widening |

##### 4. Inflammatory Arthritis (RA, SLE, Ankylosing Spondylitis)

- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Rarely presents as isolated hip involvement, but can cause hip synovitis. Morning stiffness > 60 minutes, polyarticular, symmetrical. X-ray shows periarticular osteopenia and erosions (not sclerosis/crescent sign).
- **Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)**: Young men with inflammatory back pain, sacroiliac joint involvement. Hip involvement occurs in ~30%. X-ray may show SI joint fusion. Distinguished from AVN by the systemic inflammatory features, HLA-B27 positivity, and distinct radiological pattern.
- **SLE**: Important because SLE patients get AVN from both the disease itself (vasculitis, antiphospholipid antibodies) AND steroid treatment. A lupus patient with hip pain may have lupus arthritis OR AVN — MRI is essential to differentiate.
- ***Crystal deposition diseases (e.g. gout)*** [1]: Can cause acute monoarthritis of the hip. Distinguished by joint aspiration showing crystals (negatively birefringent monosodium urate for gout, positively birefringent calcium pyrophosphate for pseudogout).

##### 5. Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI)

- **Definition**: Abnormal morphology of the femoral head-neck junction (cam type) or acetabulum (pincer type) causes abnormal contact during hip motion → labral damage → cartilage wear → secondary OA
- **Why it mimics AVN**: Both affect young adults with groin pain and limited internal rotation. However, FAI pain is characteristically **activity-related** (especially with flexion and internal rotation activities like squatting) and **C-sign** positive (patient cups their hand over the anterolateral hip)
- **Distinguished by**: MRI/MR arthrography showing labral tears and bony morphology; no marrow signal changes typical of AVN

##### 6. Labral Tear of the Hip

- Often coexists with FAI
- Mechanical symptoms: clicking, catching, locking
- Pain with specific provocative tests (FADIR — Flexion, ADduction, Internal Rotation)
- MR arthrography is the gold standard

##### 7. Transient Osteoporosis of the Hip (Bone Marrow Oedema Syndrome)

- **Self-limiting** condition causing hip pain, typically in middle-aged men or women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy
- **Why it's critical**: On MRI, it shows **diffuse bone marrow oedema** of the femoral head — this can look very similar to early AVN (Ficat I). However, transient osteoporosis has **no double line sign** and **resolves spontaneously** within 6–12 months
- X-ray may show diffuse osteopenia of the femoral head
- Some consider it a precursor or early form of AVN — the distinction matters because management differs dramatically

<Callout title="Exam Trap" type="error">
**Transient osteoporosis vs Early AVN on MRI**: Both show bone marrow oedema. The key differentiator is the **double line sign on T2W MRI** — present in AVN, absent in transient osteoporosis. Transient osteoporosis also shows **diffuse** oedema throughout the femoral head (not focal), and resolves on serial imaging.
</Callout>

##### 8. Hip Dislocation

- ***Posterior dislocation (90%)***: ***dashboard injury (flexed hip & knee against dashboard in RTA); shortened limb that is adducted, internally rotated and flexed; associated injuries include fracture (femoral head, NOF), sciatic nerve injury; complications include AVN (fracture-dislocation highest risk)*** [6]
- Acute presentation — should not be confused with chronic AVN, but posterior dislocation is a *cause* of subsequent AVN (10–25% risk) [1]

#### B. Paediatric Differentials (Age-Specific)

If the patient is a child or adolescent, the differential changes entirely:

##### 9. Perthes Disease (Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease)

- ***Idiopathic AVN of proximal femoral epiphysis in children*** [7]
- ***Boys aged 5–10 years*** [7]
- ***Hip pain, loss of internal rotation and abduction*** [7]
- ***X-ray: medial joint space widening, crescent sign*** [7]
- Essentially the paediatric equivalent of adult AVN, but idiopathic

##### 10. Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE)

- ***Obese boys aged 10–15 years*** [7]
- ***Hip pain that may radiate to knee, antalgic gait, loss of internal rotation, abduction, flexion*** [7]
- ***Complications: slipping at contralateral hip, AVN*** [7]
- Distinguished from AVN by age group, body habitus, and characteristic X-ray (posterior slip of epiphysis relative to metaphysis on frog-leg lateral view)

##### 11. Transient Synovitis (Irritable Hip)

- Most common cause of hip pain in children aged 3–10 years
- Self-limiting viral-associated synovitis
- Must be distinguished from **septic arthritis** (the critical differential) using Kocher criteria (fever, non-weight-bearing, ESR > 40, WCC > 12,000)

#### C. Extra-articular / Periarticular Causes

##### 12. Trochanteric Bursitis / Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome

- ***Listed as DDx of OA hip*** [2]
- Inflammation of the bursa overlying the greater trochanter
- **Lateral hip pain** (not groin pain — this is the key distinguishing feature from AVN)
- Tender over the greater trochanter on palpation
- Pain reproduced by resisted hip abduction or lying on the affected side

##### 13. Gluteus Medius Tendinopathy / Tear

- ***Listed as DDx of OA hip*** [2]
- "Rotator cuff of the hip" — degenerative tendinopathy of the gluteus medius insertion at the greater trochanter
- Lateral hip pain, Trendelenburg sign positive if complete tear
- Distinguished from AVN by location of pain (lateral vs groin) and MRI findings

##### 14. Iliotibial Band Syndrome

- Lateral hip/thigh pain, especially in runners
- Snapping sensation over the greater trochanter
- Distinguished by clinical history and examination

##### 15. Piriformis Syndrome

- Deep buttock pain with possible sciatic nerve irritation (the sciatic nerve runs deep to or through the piriformis muscle)
- Pain on internal rotation and sitting
- Distinguished from AVN by the posterior/buttock location and neural symptoms

#### D. Referred Pain

##### 16. Lumbar Spine Pathology (Sciatica / Radiculopathy)

- ***Sciatica: radiculopathy (nerve root compression) at L5–S1 from a herniated (prolapsed) disc; pain, numbness, tingling in the distribution of sciatic nerve; sharp or burning pain that radiates down the posterior or lateral aspect of leg usually to foot or ankle*** [8]
- L2-4 radiculopathy can refer pain to the groin and anterior thigh, mimicking hip pathology
- Distinguished by: dermatomal distribution of pain/numbness, positive straight leg raise, lumbar spine tenderness, neurological signs (weakness, reflex changes)
- ***Differential diagnosis of back pain includes: spondylosis, prolapsed disc, spinal stenosis, cauda equina syndrome, muscle strain, fractures, infection (TB spine), tumour, inflammation (AS), extra-spinal causes*** [9]

##### 17. Knee Pathology Referring to Hip

- Less common direction of referral, but possible via shared femoral/obturator nerve innervation

##### 18. Visceral / Non-Musculoskeletal Causes

- **Inguinal hernia**: Groin pain worsened by Valsalva; palpable lump
- **Nephrolithiasis/pyelonephritis**: Flank → groin radiation, haematuria, fever
- **Gynaecological**: Ovarian cyst, endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy in women
- **Vascular**: Femoral artery aneurysm, iliac artery occlusion (claudication)

#### E. Neoplastic Causes

##### 19. Bone Tumours

- **Primary**: Osteosarcoma (adolescents/young adults — metaphysis of long bones), Ewing's sarcoma, chondrosarcoma
- **Secondary (metastatic)**: Lung, breast, prostate, renal, thyroid — common in elderly; lytic or blastic lesions on X-ray; night pain, weight loss, pathological fracture
- Distinguished from AVN by: constitutional symptoms, destructive/permeative pattern on imaging, soft tissue mass on MRI, raised tumour markers

##### 20. Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)

- ***Abnormal development of hip resulting in dysplasia (shallow acetabulum), subluxation, or dislocation*** [10]
- In adults, untreated DDH → secondary OA (from abnormal loading due to inadequate acetabular coverage)
- ***Management includes periacetabular osteotomy (symptomatic dysplasia in young adult with concentrically reduced hip and congruent joint space, before OA changes) or total hip replacement (secondary OA changes, hip subluxation)*** [1]
- Distinguished from AVN by: history (childhood hip problems, clicking hip), X-ray showing acetabular dysplasia rather than femoral head necrosis

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Systematic approach**: Think intra-articular (degenerative, inflammatory, infective, vascular/AVN, traumatic) vs extra-articular (periarticular soft tissue) vs referred (spine, knee, visceral).

2. **AVN vs OA hip**: AVN is younger (20–50y) with risk factors; early X-ray shows sclerosis/crescent sign with preserved joint space. OA is older (> 60y) with joint space narrowing as earliest feature.

3. **Never miss septic arthritis**: Acute onset, fever, raised inflammatory markers, purulent aspirate. It's an emergency.

4. **Transient osteoporosis vs early AVN**: Both show MRI marrow oedema, but AVN has the double line sign and transient osteoporosis resolves spontaneously.

5. **Always examine the hip in knee pain** and vice versa — shared innervation via femoral and obturator nerves.

6. **Paediatric differentials are age-specific**: Perthes (5–10y), SCFE (10–15y), transient synovitis (3–10y), septic arthritis (any age — emergency).

7. **OA hip in Chinese patients is usually secondary** (trauma, AVN, infection, inflammatory, DDH) — primary OA is uncommon in Chinese populations.
