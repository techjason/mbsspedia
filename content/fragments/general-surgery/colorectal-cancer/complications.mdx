## Complications of Colorectal Cancer

Complications of CRC can be organised into three broad categories:

1. **Complications of the disease itself** (i.e., what the tumour does if left untreated or at presentation)
2. **Complications of surgical treatment** (immediate, early, and late post-operative)
3. **Complications of non-surgical treatment** (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy)

Understanding the *mechanism* behind each complication is far more important than rote memorisation — if you know why it happens, you can predict it, recognise it, and manage it.

---

### 1. Complications of the Disease Itself

These are the complications of CRC that may be the presenting feature (emergency presentations) or develop during the disease course.

#### 1A. Large Bowel Obstruction

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | An annular constricting tumour (typically left-sided) progressively narrows the lumen until formed stool cannot pass → complete mechanical obstruction. Left-sided tumours obstruct more readily because the lumen is narrower and stool is solid. Right-sided tumours rarely obstruct because the caecal lumen is wide and stool is liquid [1] |
| **Frequency** | CRC is the **commonest cause of large bowel obstruction (LBO) in adults** [5]. ~10–30% of CRC patients present with obstruction |
| **Clinical features** | Absolute constipation (no stool or flatus), progressive abdominal distension, colicky abdominal pain, late vomiting (may be faeculent — "faeculent" because bacteria ferment the stagnant small bowel content, producing a faecal smell) |
| **Closed-loop obstruction** | If the **ileocaecal valve is competent** (in ~1/3 of the population), the obstruction becomes a **closed loop** — the colon is obstructed distally by tumour and proximally by the competent valve. Pressure builds within the closed loop, and the caecum is at greatest risk of perforation (Law of Laplace: wall tension = pressure × radius; the caecum has the greatest radius) [13] |
| **Management** | ***Emergency surgery*** [10]: Right-sided → right hemicolectomy + primary anastomosis ± decompression. Left-sided → ***Hartmann's operation*** (resection + end colostomy) [10][12], or segmental resection with on-table lavage [5], or subtotal colectomy [5]. ***Endoluminal stenting*** as bridge to elective surgery for left-sided tumours [5][10] |

<Callout title="Closed-Loop Obstruction" type="error">
This is a surgical emergency. If a patient has LBO from a sigmoid tumour and a competent ileocaecal valve, the trapped gas in the closed loop progressively distends the caecum. When caecal diameter exceeds **12 cm on AXR**, the risk of perforation becomes critical (caecal perforation is life-threatening with high mortality). You must intervene before this happens — either with emergent stenting or emergency surgery.
</Callout>

#### 1B. Perforation

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Two patterns: (1) **Tumour perforation** — the cancer erodes through the full thickness of the bowel wall → faecal peritonitis or localised abscess. (2) **Proximal perforation** (diastatic perforation) — closed-loop obstruction → caecal distension → ischaemic necrosis of the caecal wall → perforation at the caecum, remote from the tumour itself. In both cases, faecal content spills into the peritoneal cavity |
| **Clinical features** | Sudden severe abdominal pain, peritonism (guarding, rigidity, rebound tenderness), absent bowel sounds, septic shock (fever, tachycardia, hypotension). Free air under diaphragm on erect CXR or AXR |
| **Significance** | Perforation upstages the tumour to at least **T4a** (penetration of visceral peritoneum) → worse prognosis. Also causes faecal peritonitis with high mortality (up to 20–40%) |
| **Management** | Emergency laparotomy: Hartmann's procedure (left-sided) or right hemicolectomy (right-sided) with peritoneal lavage. Primary anastomosis is generally **NOT** performed in diffuse peritonitis [1] |

#### 1C. Haemorrhage

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Tumour surface is friable, necrotic, or ulcerated → erosion into blood vessels in the bowel wall. Usually venous, causing chronic occult blood loss rather than massive haemorrhage. Rarely, erosion into a larger vessel → acute massive lower GI bleeding |
| **Chronic bleeding** | Manifests as iron deficiency anaemia (especially right-sided CRC — blood mixes with liquid stool and is invisible). IDA is the **most common complication** of right-sided CRC, though it is often a presenting feature rather than a late complication |
| **Acute bleeding** | Acute massive PR bleeding (haematochezia) is uncommon but can be life-threatening |
| **Management** | Chronic: iron replacement + definitive surgery. Acute: resuscitation → colonoscopy (if haemodynamically stable) → angiographic embolisation or emergency surgery if uncontrolled [1] |

#### 1D. Fistula Formation (Disease-Related)

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Tumour invades through the bowel wall into an adjacent organ, creating an abnormal communication. This is a manifestation of **T4b** disease |
| **Types** | **Colovesical fistula** (colon → bladder): most common fistula from sigmoid CRC; patient presents with ***pneumaturia*** (bubbles in urine — pathognomonic), ***fecaluria*** (faeces in urine), and recurrent UTIs. **Colovaginal fistula**: passage of faeces/flatus per vagina. **Coloenteric fistula**: communication with small bowel |
| **Management** | Surgery: en bloc resection of tumour + involved organ segment (e.g., partial cystectomy for colovesical fistula). Often requires temporary faecal diversion |

#### 1E. Metastatic Disease

| Site | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Liver*** | ***Commonest site of distant metastasis*** — portal venous drainage [1]. ***Hard nodular hepatomegaly, RUQ tenderness, obstructive jaundice (if mets to porta hepatis LN)*** [10] | ***Hepatomegaly with or without symptoms from primary; RUQ pain; general features of malignancy: anorexia, weight loss, cachexia*** [7] |
| ***Lung*** | Haematogenous spread. ***Distal rectal tumours → IVC → lungs*** (bypass liver) [1] | Cough, dyspnoea, haemoptysis; cannonball lesions on CXR/CT |
| ***Peritoneum*** | Transperitoneal/transcoelomic spread; serosal breach seeds peritoneal cavity | ***Ascites suggest peritoneal seeding from GI or gynaecological primary*** [7]; abdominal distension; Krukenberg tumour (ovarian metastases) |
| Brain | Late haematogenous; rare | Headache, focal neurological deficits, seizures |
| Bone | Late haematogenous; rare | Bone pain, pathological fractures, hypercalcaemia |

***Management of colorectal liver metastases*** [7][10]:
- ***Hepatic resection can prolong survival in patients with resectable liver metastasis (solitary or ≤ 4 metastases all located within one lobe); 5-year survival 25%*** (historical); more recent data 40–50% [7][10]
- ***One-third recurrence in the liver remnant*** [7]
- ***Colorectal metastasis: systemic or transarterial regional chemotherapy may be indicated in patients with unresectable colorectal liver secondaries (response rate 20–30%)*** [7]
- ***Perioperative chemotherapy: FOLFOX*** [10]

#### 1F. Peritoneal Carcinomatosis

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Mechanism | Serosal penetration (T4a) or tumour cell spillage at surgery seeds the peritoneum; peritoneal deposits cause ascites by blocking peritoneal lymphatic drainage and by secreting fluid |
| Prognosis | Very poor; M1c staging |
| Management | Selected cases: cytoreductive surgery (CRS) + hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Palliative: drainage of ascites, systemic chemotherapy |

---

### 2. Complications of Surgical Treatment

Organised as: **Immediate (intra-operative) → Early (< 30 days) → Late (> 30 days)**, with complications common to both colon and rectal surgery, followed by those specific to rectal surgery.

#### 2A. Immediate / Intra-Operative Complications

***Massive bleeding requiring conversion to laparotomy (< 10%)*** [10]

***Injury to neighbouring structures*** [1][10]:

| Structure Injured | Context / Mechanism | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| ***Left ureter and gonadal vessels*** | At risk during ligation of IMA, sigmoid mobilisation, or pelvic dissection [10]. The left ureter crosses the pelvic brim beneath the sigmoid mesocolon and is easily mistaken for a vessel | Ureteric transection → urine leak, urinoma; if unrecognised → hydronephrosis, renal damage |
| ***Iliac artery*** | Lateral pelvic dissection [10] | Haemorrhage |
| ***GB, D2 (duodenum)*** | During ***right hemicolectomy*** — the hepatic flexure is intimately related to the duodenum and gallbladder [10] | Bile leak, duodenal perforation |
| ***Seminal vesicles*** | During ***LAR*** — anterior dissection in males [10] | Sexual dysfunction |
| ***Spleen*** | During ***splenic flexure mobilisation in TME*** — traction on the splenocolic ligament can tear the splenic capsule [10] | Haemorrhage; may require splenectomy |
| ***Autonomic nerve injury*** | ***Especially in rectal surgery*** [10] | See below |

##### Autonomic Nerve Injury (Rectal Surgery) — In Detail

This is a critically important complication unique to rectal surgery, and understanding the anatomy explains everything:

***Autonomic nerve injury (especially in rectal surgery): sympathetic vs. parasympathetic*** [10]:

| Nerve System | Anatomy | Function | Injury Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Sympathetic*** | Hypogastric nerves (presacral plexus) — run along the promontory and anterior to the sacrum, then lateral to the mesorectum | Maintain bladder neck tone (continence); control ejaculation | ***Incontinence (bladder neck incompetence), impaired ejaculation (retrograde ejaculation or anejaculation)*** [10] |
| ***Parasympathetic*** | Pelvic splanchnic nerves (nervi erigentes, S2–S4) — run anterolaterally from the pelvic sidewall to the pelvic plexus | Detrusor contraction (bladder emptying); penile erection | ***Urinary retention (detrusor underactivity), erectile dysfunction*** [10] |

***High tie vs. low tie of IMA*** [10]:
- ***High tie*** (at IMA origin): risk of damaging the ***hypogastric nerve*** which crosses near the IMA origin
- ***Low tie*** (distal to left colic artery): ***avoids damage to the hypogastric nerve → lower risk of autonomic dysfunction*** [10]

> **Why is nerve preservation so important?** Because these are young/middle-aged patients who may live for decades after curative surgery. Permanent urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or ejaculatory failure are devastating quality-of-life consequences. TME along the "holy plane" is specifically designed to preserve these nerves while achieving adequate oncological margins.

#### 2B. Early Complications (< 30 days)

##### Surgical Site Infection (SSI)

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Mechanism | Contamination of the surgical wound by colonic bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, E. coli, Enterococcus) during surgery. The colon is the most heavily colonised segment of the GI tract (~10¹¹ organisms/g stool) |
| Prevention | ***IV antibiotic prophylaxis (significantly decreases wound infections)*** [1]; mechanical bowel preparation; skin preparation; meticulous surgical technique |
| Presentation | Wound erythema, warmth, discharge (purulent), fever, elevated WCC — typically post-operative day 3–7 |
| Management | Open wound, drain pus (incision and drainage), wound packing, antibiotics if cellulitis |

##### Postoperative Ileus

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Mechanism | Temporary paralysis of bowel motility following abdominal surgery. Caused by: handling of bowel (inflammatory mediators), anaesthetic agents, opioid analgesics, electrolyte disturbance (especially hypokalaemia). Normal expected duration: stomach 24h, small bowel 24–48h, colon 3–5 days |
| Presentation | Abdominal distension, absent flatus/stool, nausea/vomiting, absent or hypoactive bowel sounds |
| Management | Conservative: NGT if severe, IV fluids, correct electrolytes, minimise opioids, early mobilisation, chewing gum (stimulates vagal activity → promotes peristalsis). Prolonged ileus (> 5–7 days) should raise suspicion of mechanical obstruction, intra-abdominal abscess, or anastomotic leak |

##### ***Anastomotic Leak*** — The Most Feared Early Complication

> ***Anastomotic leak is the single most feared complication of colorectal surgery.*** It carries a mortality rate of 10–20% and is the major cause of morbidity after CRC surgery [1][10].

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Mechanism | Failure of the surgical join (anastomosis) to heal → breakdown of the suture line → spillage of intestinal content (faecal or enteric) into the peritoneal cavity or pelvis. Caused by: ischaemia of the bowel ends (poor blood supply), tension on the anastomosis, distal obstruction, infection, malnutrition, corticosteroids, smoking, previous radiotherapy |
| ***Timing*** | ***Becomes apparent 5–7 days postoperatively*** [1] — this is the critical window because it takes this long for the immature anastomosis to break down before fibrinous healing creates a seal |
| ***Classification*** | ***Intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal leakage*** [1] |
| ***Clinical signs*** | ***Pain, fever, tachycardia, feculent or purulent drainage*** [1]. Unexplained tachycardia on post-op day 5–7 is anastomotic leak until proven otherwise. Peritonism, sepsis, raised WCC and CRP |
| ***Radiological signs*** | ***Fluid or gas-containing collections*** on CT [1]; extraluminal contrast leak on water-soluble contrast enema |
| ***Management*** | ***Fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, bowel rest, image-guided percutaneous drainage of abscess, temporary faecal diversion, or drainage or resection of the anastomosis*** [1] |
| ***Risk factors for leak*** | Left-sided anastomosis > right-sided; low rectal anastomosis (LAR) has the highest leak rate; male sex (narrow pelvis); previous radiotherapy; malnutrition; steroids; emergency surgery; no diverting stoma |

> Why are left-sided and low rectal anastomoses more prone to leak? Three reasons: (1) The blood supply to the left colon and rectum is less robust (single marginal artery, IMA territory); (2) The pelvis is narrow and deep, making it technically harder to create a tension-free, well-vascularised anastomosis; (3) Stool is formed and under higher pressure in the left colon/rectum compared to the liquid content on the right side.

> ***A defunctioning loop ileostomy does NOT decrease the rate of anastomotic leakage, but decreases the complication rate and risk of reoperation in cases of anastomotic leakage*** [1] — because when a leak occurs with a stoma in place, the faecal stream is diverted and the leak can heal without contaminating the peritoneum.

##### Anastomotic Bleeding (Early)

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Mechanism | Bleeding from the suture line of the anastomosis |
| Management | ***Blood transfusion and correction of underlying coagulopathy*** [1]. Rarely requires re-operation; most cases are self-limiting |

#### 2C. Late Complications (> 30 days)

##### Anastomotic Stricture

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Mechanism | Excessive fibrosis/scarring at the anastomotic site during healing → narrowing of the lumen. More common after ischaemic leaks (inflammation → fibrosis), low rectal anastomosis, radiotherapy |
| Presentation | Progressive difficulty with bowel movements, obstructive symptoms, thin stools |
| Management | ***Majority of patients do not require intervention*** [1]. Those requiring treatment: ***finger dilatation for low anastomosis; endoscopic balloon dilatation for high anastomosis*** [1][10] |

##### ***Fistula***

***Enterocutaneous (colocutaneous), rectovaginal (colovaginal), and rectourinary fistula can occur following colorectal surgery*** [1]:

| Type | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Enterocutaneous fistula*** | Leak from anastomosis tracks to skin surface through the wound | ***Conservative management since most will close spontaneously without operative intervention*** [1][10] — manage with wound care, nutritional support (NPO / low-residue diet), and control of sepsis |
| ***Rectovaginal or rectourinary fistula*** | Anastomotic leak or local tissue ischaemia tracks into vagina or urinary tract; more common after low rectal surgery (proximity to vagina/bladder) | ***Should be managed initially with proximal faecal diversion*** [1][10] (defunctioning stoma to allow the fistula to heal). Definitive repair later if it does not close |

##### ***Perineal Hernia (after APR)***

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Mechanism | After abdominoperineal resection, the pelvic floor is deficient where the rectum and anus were removed. Small bowel or omentum herniate through this defect into the perineal wound |
| Presentation | Perineal bulge, discomfort sitting, skin breakdown |
| Management | Mesh repair if symptomatic |

##### ***LAR Syndrome (Low Anterior Resection Syndrome)***

This is one of the most important quality-of-life complications to understand:

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| ***Definition / Signs and Symptoms*** | ***Change in bowel movement (ranging from constipation to faecal urgency, faecal incontinence) that persists ≥ 1 month after surgery*** [10] |
| ***Pathophysiology*** | ***Colonic dysmotility*** (denervation from pelvic dissection → loss of coordinated peristalsis), ***neorectal reservoir dysfunction*** (the new "neo-rectum" formed by the colon lacks the compliance and capacitance of the native rectum → reduced reservoir function → urgency and frequency), ***anal sphincter dysfunction*** (direct damage or nerve injury during surgery) [10] |
| ***Incidence*** | 60–90% of patients after LAR experience some degree of LAR syndrome; ~50% have significant symptoms |
| ***Prevention*** | ***Post-operative pelvic floor muscle exercise***, ***anterograde colonic irrigation via stoma / enema***, ***faecal diversion*** (temporary ileostomy gives the pelvis time to heal) [10] |
| ***Management*** | ***Antidiarrhoeal agents*** (loperamide), ***transanal irrigation*** (retrograde washout), ***pelvic floor rehabilitation***, ***sacral nerve stimulation*** (a pacemaker for the pelvic nerves — modulates residual nerve function) [10] |

> **Why does LAR syndrome occur?** Think of it this way — the rectum is a sophisticated reservoir with compliant walls, a rich nerve supply, and coordinated sphincter function. When you remove the rectum and replace it with a straight tube of colon (or a J-pouch), you lose: (1) the reservoir capacity (less volume before urgency), (2) the normal recto-anal inhibitory reflex (the ability to distinguish gas from stool), and (3) some of the nerve supply from surgical dissection. The result is a constellation of urgency, frequency, clustering (multiple bowel movements over a short period), and incontinence.

#### 2D. Stoma Complications

Stomas (colostomy or ileostomy) are frequently created in CRC surgery — either as temporary defunctioning stomas (loop ileostomy protecting a low anastomosis) or permanent end colostomies (APR). Stoma complications are common and high yield for exams [1]:

##### Early Stoma Complications (< 30 days)

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Stomal bleeding** | Mucocutaneous suture line bleeding; trauma during appliance change | Usually self-limiting; direct pressure; rarely requires suture |
| **Stomal necrosis** | Ischaemia of the stoma — inadequate blood supply to the bowel segment brought through the abdominal wall (tension on mesentery, thrombosis of marginal vessels) | Inspect with torch — if necrosis extends below fascial level → emergency revision (risk of peritonitis from necrotic bowel); if superficial → observe |
| **Stomal retraction** | Stoma sinks below skin level — due to tension on mesentery, obesity, or poor surgical technique | Convex appliance to maintain seal; surgical revision if severe |
| **Mucocutaneous separation** | Breakdown of the junction between stoma mucosa and skin — due to infection, ischaemia, or tension | Wound care; usually heals by secondary intention |
| ***Skin irritation and dermatitis*** | ***Most common in end and loop ileostomy due to high-output and high alkaline enzymatic effluent*** [1]. Ileostomy output contains activated pancreatic enzymes (trypsin, lipase) that digest the peristomal skin | Proper appliance fitting; skin barrier products (stomahesive); reducing output (loperamide, fibre supplementation) |

##### Late Stoma Complications (> 30 days)

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Parastomal hernia*** | Most common late stoma complication. Weakness of the abdominal wall around the stoma tract → herniation of bowel/omentum through the defect. More common in colostomies (larger aperture) than ileostomies | Abdominal support belt; surgical repair with mesh if symptomatic or at risk of incarceration |
| ***Stomal prolapse*** | Full-thickness intussusception of the bowel through the stoma opening. More common in loop colostomies (the distal limb prolapses because it is not fixed) | Conservative: larger stoma bag, gentle reduction. Surgical revision if symptomatic or impending gangrene |
| ***Stomal stenosis*** | Fibrosis and scarring at the fascial or skin level narrows the stoma opening → difficulty in passing stool, obstruction | Finger dilatation; surgical revision if severe |

---

### 3. Complications of Chemotherapy

| Drug | Key Complications | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***5-FU / Capecitabine*** | ***Mucositis, diarrhoea, myelosuppression (neutropenia)*** [1]; ***hand-foot syndrome (especially capecitabine)*** [1] — painful erythema and peeling of palms and soles | 5-FU inhibits rapidly dividing cells (GI mucosa, bone marrow); capecitabine is activated in skin by thymidine phosphorylase (overexpressed in tumour AND skin) |
| ***Oxaliplatin*** | ***Peripheral sensory neuropathy*** (dose-limiting — cumulative; cold-triggered acute dysaesthesia) | Platinum-DNA adducts also damage dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons; voltage-gated sodium channel dysfunction causes cold sensitivity |
| ***Irinotecan*** | ***Delayed diarrhoea*** (cholinergic mechanism); acute cholinergic syndrome (salivation, lacrimation, diarrhoea during infusion) | Active metabolite SN-38 causes direct colonic mucosal injury; cholinergic effect from acetylcholinesterase inhibition |
| All agents | ***Febrile neutropenia, nausea/vomiting, alopecia*** [1] | Myelosuppression; emetic trigger zone stimulation; damage to hair follicle cells |

##### DPD Deficiency — A Life-Threatening Complication

Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the rate-limiting enzyme for 5-FU catabolism. ~3–8% of the population carry partial DPD deficiency. Complete deficiency is rare but lethal. Patients with DPD deficiency accumulate toxic 5-FU levels → severe mucositis, diarrhoea, myelosuppression, and death. Pre-treatment DPD testing (DPYD genotyping) is now recommended before starting fluoropyrimidine therapy.

---

### 4. Complications of Radiotherapy (Rectal Cancer)

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Acute** (during or within 6 weeks) | Radiation proctitis (diarrhoea, tenesmus, PR bleeding), radiation cystitis (dysuria, haematuria), skin erythema, fatigue | Direct damage to rapidly dividing mucosal cells in the radiation field; inflammation |
| **Chronic / Late** (months to years) | Radiation fibrosis → stricture, fistula; chronic radiation proctitis (telangiectasia, bleeding); small bowel injury (if in radiation field — adhesions, stricture, fistula); ovarian failure (if pelvis irradiated); secondary malignancy (very late, rare) | Progressive obliterative endarteritis → ischaemia → fibrosis and tissue atrophy |
| | ***Impaired wound healing; increased postoperative complications; pelvic fibrosis*** [1] | Fibrosis reduces tissue vascularity; this is a key disadvantage of neoadjuvant chemoRT |

---

### 5. Complications of Targeted Therapy

| Agent | Complications | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bevacizumab (anti-VEGF)*** | ***Haemorrhage, impaired wound healing, arterial thromboembolic disease*** [1]; hypertension; proteinuria; GI perforation (especially in context of intact primary tumour) | VEGF is essential for vascular integrity, wound healing, and angiogenesis. Blocking VEGF → fragile vessels (bleeding), impaired neovascularisation (poor wound healing), loss of endothelial NO production (hypertension), glomerular endotheliosis (proteinuria) |
| ***Cetuximab / Panitumumab (anti-EGFR)*** | ***Acneiform rash, diarrhoea, electrolyte disturbance (hypomagnesaemia)*** [1] | EGFR is expressed in skin (especially hair follicles — hence acneiform rash in hair-bearing areas); EGFR in colonic mucosa (diarrhoea); EGFR in renal tubules regulates magnesium reabsorption (hypomagnesaemia) |
| ***Pembrolizumab / Nivolumab (anti-PD-1)*** | Immune-related adverse events (irAEs): colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, thyroiditis, hypophysitis, skin rash, adrenal insufficiency | Checkpoint inhibitors "release the brakes" on the immune system — this also unleashes autoimmunity against normal tissues. Any organ can be affected (the "itis" complications) |

---

### 6. Complications of Endoscopic Procedures (Diagnostic Colonoscopy / Polypectomy)

While not strictly complications of CRC treatment, these are relevant because colonoscopy is the gold standard diagnostic tool and polypectomy is often performed at the same session:

| Complication | Mechanism | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| ***Perforation*** | Mechanical (scope tip) or thermal (polypectomy cautery) | ***Chance of perforation ≤ 0.1%*** [11]. Presents with sudden pain, peritonism, free air on imaging. Management: small contained perforations may be managed with endoscopic clipping and IV antibiotics; larger perforations require emergency surgery |
| ***Post-polypectomy bleeding*** | Sloughing of eschar covering a vessel at the polypectomy site; ***typically 5–7 days after the procedure*** [1]. Can also extend the zone of thermal necrosis to involve deeper blood vessels | Most self-limiting; endoscopic haemostasis (clipping, adrenaline injection); rarely requires surgery |
| ***Post-polypectomy syndrome*** | ***Electrocoagulation injury to bowel wall creating a transmural burn and focal peritonitis without frank perforation*** [1] | ***Presents with fever, focal abdominal tenderness and leucocytosis 1–5 days following polypectomy*** [1]. Management is conservative (IV antibiotics, bowel rest) — surgery is NOT needed because there is no actual perforation. The key is distinguishing this from true perforation (no free air on imaging) |
| Sedation-related | Over-sedation, respiratory depression, aspiration | Rare with modern monitoring; managed with reversal agents (flumazenil for benzodiazepines, naloxone for opioids) |

<Callout title="Post-Polypectomy Syndrome vs. Perforation" type="error">
Students frequently confuse these two. **Post-polypectomy syndrome** = transmural burn WITHOUT perforation → focal peritonitis, fever, leucocytosis, but **NO free air** on imaging → treat conservatively (antibiotics, bowel rest). **True perforation** = free air on imaging, generalised peritonism → usually requires surgical repair. The distinction is critical because one is managed medically and the other surgically. CT scan is the key differentiator — look for free intraperitoneal air.

### 7. Long-Term Complications and Recurrence

#### Recurrence

- ***~40% of CRC patients develop recurrence*** [10]
- Most recurrences (80%) occur within the first **3 years**; hence the intensive early follow-up schedule [10]
- Types of recurrence:
  - **Local recurrence**: tumour regrowth at the primary resection site or anastomosis. More common in rectal cancer (especially without TME or with positive CRM)
  - **Distant recurrence**: metastases to liver, lung, peritoneum
  - ***Metachronous tumour***: ***a new primary cancer diagnosed ≥ 6 months after the original CRC*** [10] — this is not the same tumour coming back; it is a completely new cancer arising in the remaining colon (field effect / genetic predisposition)
- Detection: rising CEA, surveillance colonoscopy, CT TAP, PET-CT

***Follow-up protocol*** (recap) [10]:
- First 2 years: Q3m → 3rd year: Q6m → 4th–5th year: yearly → > 5 years: remission
- CEA, sigmoidoscopy, LFT at each visit; CT TAP/PET-CT annually; colonoscopy per schedule

#### Second Primary Cancers

- Lynch syndrome patients are at particularly high risk of metachronous CRC and extra-colonic cancers (endometrial, ovarian, urothelial, small bowel) — hence the extended surveillance protocols
- History of CRC is itself a risk factor for developing a second CRC — the remaining colon has the same genetic and environmental exposure

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Disease Complications:**
- **LBO** (commonest cause = CRC); closed-loop obstruction if competent ileocaecal valve → caecal perforation risk.
- **Perforation**: tumour perforation (T4a) or diastatic (caecal). High mortality. Emergency Hartmann's or right hemicolectomy.
- **Haemorrhage**: usually chronic (IDA); rarely acute massive.
- **Fistula**: colovesical (pneumaturia, fecaluria, recurrent UTI), colovaginal (faeces per vagina) — indicates T4b.
- **Metastasis**: liver (most common, portal drainage), lung (distal rectal via IVC), peritoneum (ascites).

**Surgical Complications:**
- **Immediate**: bleeding, injury to left ureter/gonadal vessels, spleen, GB/D2, autonomic nerves (sympathetic → incontinence/ejaculatory failure; parasympathetic → urinary retention/erectile dysfunction).
- **Early**: SSI, ileus, **anastomotic leak** (most feared; day 5–7; pain/fever/tachycardia; manage with resuscitation/antibiotics/drainage/diversion).
- **Late**: stricture (balloon dilatation), fistula (ECF conservative; rectovaginal/urinary → diversion), parastomal hernia, stomal prolapse/stenosis, perineal hernia (APR), **LAR syndrome** (urgency/incontinence; manage with antidiarrhoeals, pelvic floor rehab, transanal irrigation, sacral nerve stimulation).

**Chemo Complications**: 5-FU (mucositis, myelosuppression); capecitabine (hand-foot syndrome); oxaliplatin (neuropathy); irinotecan (delayed diarrhoea). DPD deficiency → lethal 5-FU toxicity.

**Targeted Therapy Complications**: Bevacizumab (bleeding, poor wound healing, thrombosis); cetuximab (acneiform rash, hypomagnesaemia); pembrolizumab (immune-related AEs).

**Colonoscopy Complications**: perforation (≤ 0.1%); post-polypectomy bleeding (day 5–7); post-polypectomy syndrome (transmural burn, no free air — conservative Mx).

**Recurrence**: 40% develop recurrence; 80% within 3 years. Follow-up: Q3m × 2 years, then Q6m, then yearly.

      question: "Explain why sympathetic nerve injury during rectal surgery causes ejaculatory failure, while parasympathetic injury causes erectile dysfunction.",
      markscheme: "Sympathetic fibres (hypogastric nerves) control ejaculation (seminal emission and bladder neck closure). Damage causes retrograde ejaculation or anejaculation. Parasympathetic fibres (pelvic splanchnic nerves S2-S4) mediate penile erection via vasodilation of cavernous arteries. Damage causes erectile dysfunction. Also: sympathetic injury causes bladder neck incompetence (incontinence); parasympathetic injury causes detrusor underactivity (urinary retention)."
