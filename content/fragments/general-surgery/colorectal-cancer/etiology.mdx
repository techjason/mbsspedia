# Colorectal Cancer (CRC) — Definition, Epidemiology, Risk Factors, Anatomy, Etiology, Pathophysiology, Classification, and Clinical Features

---

## 1. Definition

Colorectal cancer (CRC) refers to malignant neoplasms arising from the epithelial lining (mucosa) of the large intestine, encompassing the colon (caecum, ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid colon) and the rectum. The vast majority (> 95%) are **adenocarcinomas** — that is, cancers of glandular epithelial origin. The name tells you the story: "adeno-" = gland, "carcinoma" = epithelial malignancy.

Key conceptual points:
- CRC typically arises through a well-defined **adenoma → carcinoma sequence** over approximately 10–15 years, providing a window for screening and early intervention [1][2].
- A minority arise via the **serrated neoplasia pathway** or from flat/depressed lesions.
- ***Malignant polyps*** are defined as polyps in which neoplastic cells have **penetrated the muscularis mucosae into the submucosa** — this is the threshold because below the muscularis mucosae there are lymphatics, giving the tumour metastatic potential [3].

---

## 2. Epidemiology

### 2.1 Global Perspective

- CRC is the **3rd most common cancer worldwide** and the **2nd leading cause of cancer-related death** globally (after lung cancer) [2].
- Incidence is highest in developed/westernised countries (Australia/NZ, Europe, North America, East Asia including Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea).
- There is a rising trend in younger adults (age < 50) — so-called "early-onset CRC" — now accounting for approximately 10% of new cases globally and prompting many guidelines to lower screening start age to 45 [4].

### 2.2 Hong Kong Epidemiology

> ***CRC is the commonest cancer in Hong Kong*** [1][2].

- ***Accounts for 16.5% of all new cancer cases*** (2013 data; by 2022 Hong Kong Cancer Registry data it remains the most common cancer by incidence) [1].
- ***> 90% of CRC occurs in patients aged ≥ 50*** [1].
- ***M:F ratio ≈ 1.3:1*** [1].
- ***2nd leading cause of cancer death in both males and females*** in Hong Kong (after lung cancer) [1].
- Crude incidence rate: approximately 70–75 per 100,000 population.
- The Hong Kong government launched a **Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme** in 2016 for persons aged 50–75, using a two-tier approach (FIT → colonoscopy) [2].

### 2.3 Site Distribution

| Site | Approximate % |
|---|---|
| Rectum | ***30%*** |
| Sigmoid colon | ***20%*** |
| Descending colon | ***15%*** |
| Transverse colon | ***10%*** |
| Ascending colon (including caecum) | ***25%*** |

- ***Majority of CRC are left-sided*** [1].
- However, there is a recognized **rightward shift** in incidence with increasing age and in certain populations.
- Right-sided cancers tend to present later (more occult bleeding, less obstruction) because the bowel lumen is wider and stool is liquid.

<Callout title="Why Does Site Matter?">
Left-sided CRC (descending, sigmoid, rectum): presents earlier with obstructive symptoms, change in bowel habit, bright red PR bleeding — because the lumen is narrower and stool is formed.

Right-sided CRC (caecum, ascending, transverse): presents insidiously with iron deficiency anaemia and occult blood loss — because the lumen is wide, stool is liquid, and tumours are often polypoid/fungating rather than annular.

## 3. Risk Factors

Think of these in a systematic framework: **Demographics → Past Medical History → Family History → Social/Lifestyle → Protective Factors**.

### 3.1 Non-Modifiable Risk Factors

| Factor | Mechanism / Detail |
|---|---|
| ***Age > 50*** | ***Dominant risk factor*** — cumulative somatic mutations with time; incidence rises steeply after 50 [1][3] |
| Male sex | ~30% higher incidence; possibly related to androgens, different lifestyle patterns, and lower uptake of screening |
| ***Racial background*** | ***Ashkenazi Jews*** have higher incidence (linked to APC I1307K variant); African Americans have higher incidence and worse outcomes [1] |

### 3.2 Past Medical History

| Factor | Explanation |
|---|---|
| ***Previous CRC*** | Metachronous CRC risk; field cancerisation effect |
| ***Colonic adenomatous polyps*** | Adenoma-carcinoma sequence — higher risk if villous, > 1 cm, high-grade dysplasia [1][3] |
| ***Hereditary CRC syndromes*** | FAP, Lynch syndrome (HNPCC), MYH-associated polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers, juvenile polyposis, Cowden's syndrome [1][3][4] |
| ***Inflammatory bowel disease*** | ***UC > CD*** for CRC risk. Risk proportional to duration (> 8–10 years), extent (pancolitis > left-sided), severity of inflammation, and presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Dysplasia-carcinoma sequence rather than adenoma-carcinoma sequence [1][3] |
| ***Obesity / Central obesity*** | Insulin resistance → hyperinsulinaemia → elevated IGF-1 → promotes colonocyte proliferation; adipokine-mediated chronic inflammation [1][3] |
| ***Diabetes mellitus (DM)*** | Hyperinsulinaemia and IGF-1 promote mucosal proliferation. ~30% increased risk [1] |
| ***Acromegaly*** | ***IGF-1 acts as growth factor for colonic mucosal cells*** — increased colonocyte turnover [3] |
| Prior abdominal/pelvic radiation | Radiation-induced mucosal injury and chronic inflammation |
| Cholecystectomy (debated) | Theoretical: increased bile acid exposure to right colon, though evidence is weak |

### 3.3 Family History

- ***Family history of CRC present in ~10–15% of patients*** → confers approximately ***4× increased risk*** [1].
- ***~25% of CRC patients have a family history; ~10% have a familial syndrome*** (FAP, Lynch) [3].
- Family history of colonic adenomatous polyps also increases risk [1].
- First-degree relative with CRC diagnosed < 50 years → particularly high risk.

### 3.4 Social / Lifestyle (Modifiable)

| Factor | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Smoking*** | Carcinogens (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrosamines) → somatic mutations; smoking-related CRC often shows BRAF mutation and MSI [1] |
| ***Alcoholism*** | Acetaldehyde (ethanol metabolite) is a direct carcinogen; folate depletion impairs DNA repair [1] |
| ***Lack of physical exercise*** | Reduced gut motility → prolonged mucosal contact with carcinogens; insulin resistance pathway [1] |
| ***Dietary factors*** | ***Red and processed meat*** (heterocyclic amines, N-nitroso compounds from high-temperature cooking); ***lack of dietary fibre*** (less stool bulk → longer transit time → prolonged carcinogen exposure); ***high temperature cooking*** (generates carcinogenic compounds) [1] |
| High-fat Western diet | Increased bile acid secretion → secondary bile acids (deoxycholic acid) are co-carcinogens |

### 3.5 Protective Factors

| Factor | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Physical activity ≥ 150 min/week*** | Reduces insulin levels, decreases transit time, anti-inflammatory effect [1] |
| ***Dietary fibre*** (whole grains, beans, fruits, vegetables) | Increases stool bulk, dilutes carcinogens, reduces transit time, butyrate production by fermentation is anti-neoplastic [1] |
| ***Aspirin / NSAIDs*** | ***COX-2 inhibition → reduces prostaglandin E2 → decreases cell proliferation and angiogenesis, promotes apoptosis***. Evidence strongest for aspirin ≥ 75 mg daily for ≥ 5 years [1][3] |
| Avoid alcohol and smoking | Removes direct carcinogenic exposure [1] |
| Calcium and Vitamin D | Calcium binds bile acids and free fatty acids; Vitamin D has anti-proliferative effects |
| HRT (post-menopausal women) | Modest protective effect, possibly hormonal modulation of bile acid metabolism |

<Callout title="High Yield" type="idea">
The classic exam question: "What are the protective factors against CRC?" → Remember: **Exercise, Fibre, Aspirin/NSAIDs, Calcium/Vitamin D, avoid red meat/alcohol/smoking**.

## 4. Anatomy and Function of the Colon and Rectum

Understanding the anatomy is essential because it determines:
- Clinical presentation (right vs. left vs. rectal)
- Surgical approach (which operation for which site)
- Lymphatic and venous drainage (determines metastatic patterns)
- Relationship to surrounding structures (determines local invasion patterns)

### 4.1 Gross Anatomy

The large bowel extends from the ileocaecal valve to the anus (~1.5 m).

| Segment | Length | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Caecum** | ~6 cm | Blind pouch below ileocaecal valve; intraperitoneal; appendix arises from posteromedial wall |
| **Ascending colon** | ~15 cm | Retroperitoneal (fixed); right paracolic gutter |
| **Hepatic flexure** | — | Close to right kidney, duodenum, gallbladder |
| **Transverse colon** | ~45 cm | Intraperitoneal, suspended by transverse mesocolon; attached to greater omentum |
| **Splenic flexure** | — | Highest and most fixed point of colon; close to spleen, tail of pancreas, left kidney |
| **Descending colon** | ~25 cm | Retroperitoneal (fixed) |
| **Sigmoid colon** | ~40 cm | Intraperitoneal, on a mesentery (sigmoid mesocolon); highly mobile |
| **Rectum** | ~12–15 cm | Begins at S3; upper 1/3 covered by peritoneum anteriorly and laterally; middle 1/3 anteriorly only; lower 1/3 completely extraperitoneal |

### 4.2 Rectal Anatomy (Crucial for Rectal Cancer Staging and Surgery)

***The rectum is divided into three parts based on distance from the anal verge:*** [1]

| Division | Distance from Anal Verge |
|---|---|
| ***Upper rectum*** | ***12–15 cm*** |
| ***Mid rectum*** | ***7–12 cm*** |
| ***Lower rectum*** | ***0–7 cm (some define as < 5 cm)*** |

- The **mesorectum** is the fatty envelope surrounding the rectum containing lymph nodes, blood vessels, and nerves, enclosed by the **mesorectal fascia** (fascia propria of the rectum). This is the target of ***total mesorectal excision (TME)*** — the gold standard surgical technique for rectal cancer.
- **Circumferential resection margin (CRM)**: the closest distance between the tumour and the mesorectal fascia. A positive CRM (≤ 1 mm) strongly predicts local recurrence.
- The **dentate (pectinate) line** at approximately 2 cm from the anal verge marks the transition from columnar to squamous epithelium and is the boundary between the internal and external sphincters' territories.

### 4.3 Blood Supply

| Segment | Arterial Supply | Venous Drainage |
|---|---|---|
| Caecum → Splenic flexure | Superior mesenteric artery (SMA): ileocolic, right colic, middle colic | Superior mesenteric vein → Portal vein |
| Splenic flexure → Upper rectum | Inferior mesenteric artery (IMA): left colic, sigmoid arteries, superior rectal | Inferior mesenteric vein → Splenic vein → Portal vein |
| Mid & Lower rectum | Middle rectal arteries (from internal iliac) and inferior rectal arteries (from internal pudendal) | Middle and inferior rectal veins → Internal iliac vein → **IVC (systemic)** |

<Callout title="Why Does Venous Drainage Matter for Metastasis?">
***Liver is usually the first site of metastasis*** since the venous drainage of the intestinal tract is via the **portal venous system** [1].

***Lung can be the first site of metastasis for tumours in the distal rectum*** because the **inferior rectal veins drain into the IVC rather than the portal venous system**, bypassing the liver [1].

This is a classic exam question — you must understand that the watershed between portal and systemic venous drainage at the mid-rectum explains why distal rectal cancers can metastasise to lungs first.
</Callout>

### 4.4 Lymphatic Drainage

- Follows the arterial supply: **epicolic → paracolic → intermediate (along named vessels) → principal (at origin of SMA/IMA)**.
- ***Regional lymph node involvement is the most common form of spread and usually precedes distant metastasis*** [1].
- Minimum of **12 lymph nodes** should be harvested for adequate staging (AJCC recommendation).

### 4.5 Nerve Supply

- **Sympathetic**: via superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses → relevant for erection (sympathetic = ejaculation) and bladder function.
- **Parasympathetic**: pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2–S4) → relevant for erection and bladder emptying.
- Damage during rectal surgery (especially low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection) can cause urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory failure.

### 4.6 Function Relevant to CRC

- **Right colon**: primarily absorbs water and electrolytes; stool is liquid. This is why right-sided cancers cause **iron deficiency anaemia** (chronic occult blood loss mixed into liquid stool) rather than overt obstruction.
- **Left colon**: stores and propels formed stool. Narrower lumen + formed stool = higher risk of **obstructive symptoms** and **altered bowel habit** with left-sided cancers.
- **Rectum**: reservoir function and controlled evacuation. Rectal cancer disrupts the **call to stool**, causing **tenesmus** (a feeling of incomplete evacuation due to tumour mass mimicking stool) and **mucoid/bloody stool**.

## 5. Etiology and Pathophysiology

### 5.1 The Adenoma-Carcinoma Sequence (Vogelstein Model)

> ***MOST colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps by accumulation of mutations in what has come to be known as the adenoma-carcinoma sequence*** [1].

This is the **chromosomal instability (CIN) pathway** and accounts for ***60–70% of sporadic CRC*** [1] (some sources say up to 85% [3]).

#### Step-by-Step Molecular Progression

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Normal Epithelium"] -->|"APC loss (5q)"| B["Early Adenoma (small polyp)"]
    B -->|"K-RAS activation (12p)"| C["Intermediate Adenoma"]
    C -->|"DCC/SMAD4 loss (18q)"| D["Late Adenoma (large, villous, dysplastic)"]
    D -->|"TP53 loss (17p)"| E["Carcinoma"]
    E -->|"Additional mutations"| F["Metastasis"]
```

**Key Genes:**

1. ***APC gene*** (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli, chromosome 5q21) — a tumour suppressor gene
   - APC protein is a "gatekeeper" — it degrades β-catenin in the Wnt signalling pathway. When APC is lost, β-catenin accumulates → enters the nucleus → activates transcription of proliferative genes (c-MYC, cyclin D1).
   - ***Mutations in both alleles are necessary to initiate polyp formation*** (Knudson's two-hit hypothesis) [1].
   - ***Majority of mutations are premature stop codons → truncated APC protein*** [1].
   - ***APC inactivation alone does not result in carcinoma*** but ***sets the stage for accumulation of genetic damage that results in malignancy*** [1].

2. ***K-RAS gene*** (Kirsten Rat Sarcoma, chromosome 12p) — an oncogene
   - ***K-RAS is a signalling molecule in the EGFR pathway which leads to uncontrolled cell division*** [1].
   - RAS is a GTPase. Gain-of-function mutations lock RAS in the "ON" (GTP-bound) state → constitutive activation of RAF-MEK-ERK proliferative cascade.
   - Important clinically: ***KRAS mutant tumours do NOT respond to anti-EGFR therapy*** (cetuximab, panitumumab) — the mutation is downstream of EGFR, so blocking the receptor is futile.
   - ***Other EGFR signalling molecules such as BRAF have also been implicated in CRC pathogenesis and progression*** [1].

3. **DCC / SMAD4** (chromosome 18q) — tumour suppressor
   - DCC = "Deleted in Colorectal Cancer." SMAD4 is a mediator of TGF-β signalling (anti-proliferative pathway). Loss removes the brake on cell growth.

4. ***TP53 gene*** (chromosome 17p) — tumour suppressor ("guardian of the genome")
   - ***Initiates apoptosis in cells with irreparable genetic damage*** [1].
   - Loss of p53 is the final "gate" — allows severely damaged cells to survive and accumulate further mutations, tipping the adenoma into frank carcinoma.

5. ***MYH gene*** — ***base excision repair gene*** [1]
   - Biallelic germline mutations cause MYH-associated polyposis (MAP) — autosomal recessive, phenotypically similar to attenuated FAP.

#### About Polyps

- ***Colorectal polyps are either adenomatous or hyperplastic*** [1].
- ***Adenomatous polyps account for 2/3 of colorectal polyps*** [1].
- Subtypes by histology and malignant potential:
  - ***Tubular adenomas: malignancy risk up to 5%*** [1] — **most common** type [3]
  - ***Tubulovillous adenomas: malignancy risk up to 22%*** [1]
  - ***Villous adenomas: malignancy risk up to 40%*** [1] — ***villous adenomas secrete K-rich mucus*** which can cause **secretory diarrhoea and hypokalaemia** [3]
- ***Hyperplastic polyps account for 1/3 of colorectal polyps*** and are ***NOT pre-malignant except for rare syndrome known as hyperplastic polyposis*** [1].
- ***Advanced adenoma*** is defined as any one of: ***high-grade dysplasia, size > 1 cm, villous histology*** [3].
- ***Progression from adenoma to carcinoma takes at least 10 years on average*** [1] — this is why screening every 10 years (colonoscopy) is the standard interval.
- ***Some colonic carcinoma arises from non-polypoid adenomas that are flat or depressed*** [1].

**Morphology of polyps:** ***sessile (flat)*** / ***pedunculated (with a stalk)*** [3]

**Paris Classification of Early GI Cancer** [3]:
- 0-I (polypoid): 0-Ip (pedunculated) vs. 0-Is (sessile)
- 0-II (non-polypoid): 0-IIa (flat elevated), 0-IIb (completely flat), 0-IIc (superficially depressed)
- 0-III (excavated)

***Endoscopic features suggesting malignancy: friability, induration, ulceration, firm consistency*** [3].

<Callout title="High Yield" type="error">
A common student mistake: confusing hyperplastic polyps with adenomatous polyps. **Hyperplastic polyps are NOT pre-malignant** (except in rare hyperplastic polyposis / serrated polyposis syndrome). Only **adenomatous polyps** and **sessile serrated polyps** carry meaningful malignant potential. The exam loves testing this distinction.
</Callout>

### 5.2 Microsatellite Instability (MSI) Pathway

> ***Many of the remaining CRC are thought to arise from mutations in the MSI pathway*** — accounting for ***~15% of sporadic CRC*** [1][3].

**What are microsatellites?**
- Short tandem repeats of DNA (e.g., CACACACA...) scattered throughout the genome. These are prone to replication errors (slippage during DNA polymerase activity).
- Normally, the **DNA mismatch repair (MMR)** system (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) corrects these errors.
- When MMR is defective → errors accumulate in microsatellite regions → **microsatellite instability (MSI)** → frameshift mutations in genes with microsatellite sequences in their coding regions (e.g., TGFβRII, BAX, IGFIIR) → loss of growth control and apoptosis resistance.

**In sporadic CRC:**
- MSI is most often caused by **epigenetic silencing of MLH1** via promoter hypermethylation (not a germline mutation).
- Associated with **CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)** and often co-occurs with **BRAF V600E mutation**.
- Tend to be right-sided, mucinous, poorly differentiated, with prominent tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).
- **Paradoxically better prognosis** stage-for-stage than microsatellite stable (MSS) cancers.
- **Poor response to 5-FU** but ***excellent response to immune checkpoint inhibitors*** (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) because high mutational burden → more neoantigens → more immunogenic.

**In hereditary CRC (Lynch syndrome):**
- Germline mutation in one of the MMR genes → inherited one defective allele → second hit (somatic) knocks out the remaining allele → MSI.
- Key genes: ***MLH1 (90%), MSH2, MSH6 (10%)*** [1].

### 5.3 Serrated Neoplasia Pathway

A "third pathway" increasingly recognized:
- Sessile serrated lesions (SSLs) / traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs) → carcinoma.
- BRAF mutation → CIMP → MLH1 methylation → MSI-high cancers.
- Right-sided predominance; flat morphology makes them easy to miss at colonoscopy (the "interval cancer" problem).

### 5.4 Inflammation-Dysplasia-Carcinoma Sequence (IBD-related)

- In ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis, chronic mucosal inflammation → **dysplasia → carcinoma** (bypasses the classic polyp stage).
- Key drivers: chronic inflammation → oxidative stress → NF-κB activation → p53 mutation early (unlike sporadic CRC where p53 loss is late).
- Risk factors: duration > 8–10 years, pancolitis, PSC co-existence, family history of CRC.

## 6. Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Syndromes

> ***Account for ~10% of CRC*** (remaining 90% are sporadic) [4].

### 6.1 Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Gene | **APC** gene (chromosome 5q21) |
| Inheritance | **Autosomal dominant (AD)** with near-complete penetrance |
| Polyps | ***Hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps*** throughout the colon, beginning in adolescence |
| CRC risk | ***~100% if untreated*** by age 40–50 |
| Mean age CRC | ~39 years |
| Extra-colonic | Duodenal/periampullary adenomas (most common extra-colonic malignancy in FAP); desmoid tumours; osteomas; congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE); epidermoid cysts; thyroid cancer; hepatoblastoma (children) |
| ***Gardner syndrome*** | ***FAP + osteomas + desmoid tumours + epidermoid cysts*** [4] |
| ***Turcot syndrome*** | ***FAP + CNS tumours (medulloblastoma, glioblastoma)*** [4] |
| Attenuated FAP | < 100 polyps, later onset, right-sided predominance |
| Treatment | ***Prophylactic surgery:*** (1) Total proctocolectomy + ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) — gold standard; (2) Total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) — requires lifelong rectal surveillance [1] |
| Surveillance | Annual colonoscopy from age 10–12; OGD from age 25–30 |

### 6.2 Lynch Syndrome (HNPCC)

> ***MOST common inherited colorectal cancer syndrome*** [1].

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Gene | ***MMR genes: MLH1 (most common), MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM*** [1] |
| Inheritance | ***Autosomal dominant (AD)*** |
| Proportion of CRC | ***~3% of all CRC*** (and 2% of endometrial cancer) [1] |
| Lifetime CRC risk | ***~70–80%*** [1] |
| ***Mean age at CRC*** | ***40–45 years, some in their 20s*** [1] |
| Colonic features | ***Predominantly right-sided; arise from adenomas that tend to be larger, flatter, and more likely to have high-grade dysplasia or villous histology; adenoma-carcinoma sequence progresses much more rapidly*** [1] |
| Extra-colonic cancers | ***GI: gastric, pancreas, biliary, small intestine; Gyn: endometrial (most common extra-colonic cancer), ovarian; Uro: renal pelvis, ureter; CNS: glioma; Others: sebaceous gland tumours*** [1] |
| ***Muir-Torre syndrome*** | ***Visceral neoplasms (colorectal, endometrium, ovary) + cutaneous neoplasms (keratoacanthoma, sebaceous tumours)*** [4] |

***Diagnostic Criteria — Amsterdam Criteria (3-2-1 rule):*** [1]
- ***3*** or more relatives with Lynch syndrome-associated cancer
- ***2*** or more successive generations affected
- ***1*** or more cancer diagnosed before age 50
- FAP should be excluded
- Tumours should be verified by pathological examination

***Revised Bethesda Criteria*** (select patients for MSI analysis): [1]
- CRC diagnosed < 50 years
- CRC + ≥ 1 first-degree relative with HNPCC-related tumour, one diagnosed < 50
- CRC + ≥ 2 first-/second-degree relatives with HNPCC-related tumour regardless of age
- Synchronous/metachronous CRC or other HNPCC-related tumours regardless of age
- CRC with MSI-H-like histology (TILs, Crohn's-like reaction, mucinous, signet ring, medullary) diagnosed < 60

***Surveillance:*** [1]
- ***Colonoscopy: starting age 20–25, every 1 year (annual)***
- ***OGD with biopsy of gastric antrum: starting age 30–35, every 1–2 years***
- ***USG kidney and bladder: starting age 30–35, every 1–2 years***
- ***Pelvic examination, endometrial biopsy, transabdominal/transvaginal USG, CA-125: starting age 30–35, every 1–2 years***

***Treatment:*** [1]
- ***Total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA)*** — because of high risk of metachronous CRC, segmental resection is inadequate
- ***Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAHBSO)*** — for risk-reducing gynaecological surgery

### 6.3 Other Hereditary Syndromes

| Syndrome | Gene (Inheritance) | Key Features | Associated Cancers |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***MYH-associated polyposis (MAP)*** | MUTYH (**AR**) | DDx of FAP with fewer adenomas (10–100); very high CRC risk [4] | CRC |
| ***Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS)*** | ***STK11 (AD)*** | ***Hamartomatous polyps (small bowel > large bowel > stomach); mucosal pigmentation of buccal mucosa & lips*** [3][4] | ***Breast, pancreas, stomach, CRC*** |
| ***Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS)*** | ***SMAD4, BMPR1A (AD)*** | Hamartomatous polyps; associated with HHT if SMAD4 mutation; ***juvenile polyposis syndrome increases CRC risk, but a single juvenile polyp per se does not*** [4] | CRC |
| ***Cowden's syndrome*** | ***PTEN (AD)*** | ***Multiple hamartomas (periorbital warty trichilemmomas); increased CRC risk*** [4] | ***Breast, thyroid, CRC*** |
| ***Serrated polyposis syndrome*** | Polygenic/unknown | ≥ 5 serrated polyps proximal to sigmoid each ≥ 5 mm, or ≥ 20 serrated polyps throughout colon | CRC (via serrated pathway) |

|---|---|---|
| A | Confined to bowel wall (not through muscularis propria) | T1-2 N0 |
| B | Through bowel wall, no LN | T3-4 N0 |
| C | Lymph node involvement | Any T, N1-2 |
| D | Distant metastasis | M1 |

---

## 8. Modes of Spread

***Mode of metastasis: Haematogenous / Lymphatic / Contiguous / Transperitoneal*** [1].

| Mode | Details |
|---|---|
| **Lymphatic** | ***Regional LN is the most common form of spread and usually precedes distant metastasis*** [1]. Follows arterial supply: epicolic → paracolic → intermediate → principal nodes |
| **Haematogenous** | ***Liver is usually the first site of metastasis*** (portal venous drainage) [1]. ***Lung can be first for distal rectal tumours*** (systemic venous drainage via inferior rectal veins → IVC) [1]. Also: bone, brain, adrenals |
| **Direct / Contiguous** | Local invasion into adjacent structures (e.g., bladder, uterus, small bowel, abdominal wall) |
| **Transperitoneal (Transcoelomic)** | Serosal breach → peritoneal seeding → peritoneal carcinomatosis; can cause Krukenberg tumours (ovarian metastases) |

## 9. Clinical Features

### 9.1 General Principles

The clinical presentation of CRC depends critically on **tumour location** and **stage**. Early CRC is often **asymptomatic** — this is why screening is so important.

<Callout title="Red Flags for CRC in Primary Care">
Any patient ≥ 50 (or younger with risk factors) presenting with:
- New iron deficiency anaemia (especially males and post-menopausal females)
- Change in bowel habit > 4 weeks
- Rectal bleeding (especially dark blood mixed with stool)
- Unexplained weight loss
- Abdominal mass
→ must be investigated with colonoscopy until proven otherwise.
</Callout>

### 9.2 Symptoms

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Iron deficiency anaemia** (most common presentation) | Chronic occult blood loss from friable, ulcerated tumour surface. Stool is liquid in the right colon → blood is mixed into stool and occult (not visible). Right-sided tumours are often large and fungating (polypoid), so they bleed chronically. The patient presents with fatigue, dyspnoea, pallor |
| **Vague right iliac fossa / abdominal discomfort** | Tumour distension of caecal wall; dull visceral pain (innervated by T10–T12 splanchnic nerves) |
| **Palpable right iliac fossa mass** | Advanced tumour growing to a large size before causing symptoms (wide caecal lumen accommodates growth) |
| **Weight loss / anorexia** | Tumour metabolic demands (cancer cachexia); TNF-α and IL-6 release suppress appetite and induce catabolism |
| **Occult PR bleeding** | Blood mixed into liquid stool; patient usually unaware — detected only on FOBT/FIT or by finding anaemia |

> **Why does right-sided CRC rarely cause obstruction?** Because the caecum has the widest lumen of the colon (~7.5 cm diameter), and stool at this point is liquid. Even a large tumour cannot easily occlude the lumen.

#### B. Left-Sided (Splenic Flexure, Descending Colon, Sigmoid)

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| ***Change in bowel habit*** (most common) | Tumour narrows the lumen (left-sided cancers are often annular/constricting "apple core" lesions). Formed stool cannot pass easily → alternating constipation and diarrhoea. The constipation is from obstruction; the diarrhoea is from overflow of liquid stool past the obstruction and increased mucus secretion |
| **Colicky abdominal pain** | Bowel distension proximal to partial obstruction → stretch of bowel wall → intermittent (colicky) visceral pain |
| **PR bleeding (bright or dark red)** | Stool is formed and abrades the tumour surface; blood is less diluted so more visible. Sigmoid/rectal tumours bleed more overtly |
| **Sensation of incomplete evacuation** | Tumour bulk in the sigmoid creates a mass effect mimicking residual stool |
| ***Large bowel obstruction*** | Progressive luminal narrowing by annular tumour → complete obstruction. Presents with absolute constipation (no stool or flatus), abdominal distension, colicky pain, vomiting (late feature — "faeculent vomiting") |

#### C. Rectal Cancer

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| ***Fresh PR bleeding / blood mixed with stool*** | Direct contact of formed stool with tumour; rectal tumours are close to the anal verge so blood is bright red and visible on stool or toilet paper |
| ***Tenesmus*** ("tenesmus" from Latin "to strain") | Tumour mass in the rectum stimulates stretch receptors → brain interprets this as "there is stool to pass" → repeated urge to defaecate with a feeling of incomplete evacuation |
| **Mucous discharge** | Mucin-secreting tumour (especially mucinous adenocarcinoma); villous rectal adenomas also secrete copious mucus |
| **Change in stool calibre** ("pencil-thin stools") | Annular constricting tumour narrows the rectal lumen → stool is moulded into a narrower shape |
| **Rectal pain** | Late sign; indicates invasion beyond the rectal wall into the perirectal tissues, sacral plexus, or pelvic sidewall — somatic pain (well-localised, constant, aching) |
| **Urinary symptoms** (frequency, haematuria, pneumaturia) | Direct invasion into the bladder (colovesical fistula) → air and faecal material in urine (pathognomonic pneumaturia = bubbles in urine) |
| **Fistulae** (rectovaginal) | Direct invasion into the vagina → passage of stool or flatus per vagina |

#### D. General / Constitutional Symptoms (Any Site)

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| Weight loss | Cancer cachexia: TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6 → protein catabolism, lipolysis, anorexia |
| Anorexia | Cytokine-mediated hypothalamic suppression of appetite |
| Fatigue / malaise | Anaemia + cancer cachexia + chronic disease |
| Fever (rare) | Tumour necrosis → pyrogen release; also consider superimposed abscess |

#### E. Symptoms of Metastatic Disease

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| Right upper quadrant pain / hepatomegaly | Liver metastases stretching Glisson's capsule |
| Jaundice | Hepatic metastases compressing intrahepatic bile ducts; less commonly hilar LN compression |
| Cough / dyspnoea / haemoptysis | Pulmonary metastases |
| Bone pain | Skeletal metastases (rare, late) |
| Ascites | Peritoneal carcinomatosis blocking peritoneal lymphatic drainage; or liver failure from massive hepatic metastases |
| Abdominal distension | Peritoneal carcinomatosis with ascites; or bowel obstruction from carcinomatosis |

#### F. Acute Presentations (Surgical Emergencies)

***CRC may present as surgical emergencies — these are high yield*** [5]:

| Presentation | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Large bowel obstruction*** | Annular tumour completely occluding the lumen. Most commonly left-sided (sigmoid > descending). Presents with absolute constipation, progressive abdominal distension, colicky pain, vomiting. ***CRC is the commonest cause of large bowel obstruction in adults*** [5] |
| ***Perforation*** | Tumour perforates through the bowel wall → faecal peritonitis (free perforation) or localised abscess (contained perforation). Also: **caecal perforation from a competent ileocaecal valve** — a closed-loop obstruction where the obstructing tumour is in the sigmoid but the caecum distends until it perforates (Law of Laplace: wall tension is highest where diameter is greatest) |
| ***Haemorrhage*** | Massive lower GI bleeding from erosion into a major vessel by the tumour — uncommon but life-threatening |

### 9.3 Signs

#### A. General Examination

| Sign | Significance |
|---|---|
| **Pallor** | Iron deficiency anaemia from chronic occult blood loss |
| **Cachexia / wasting** | Advanced disease; cancer cachexia |
| **Koilonychia** | Severe iron deficiency (spoon-shaped nails; "koilos" = hollow in Greek) |
| **Angular stomatitis / glossitis** | Iron deficiency |
| ***Lymphadenopathy*** | Left supraclavicular node (***Virchow's node / Troisier's sign***) — indicates advanced metastatic GI malignancy via the thoracic duct |
| **Sister Mary Joseph nodule** | Periumbilical metastatic nodule — indicates peritoneal carcinomatosis |
| **Acanthosis nigricans** | Dark velvety hyperpigmentation in axillae/neck — paraneoplastic (associated with GI adenocarcinomas; mediated by IGF-1-like factors) |
| **Mucocutaneous pigmentation** | Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (lips, buccal mucosa) — clue to hereditary aetiology |

#### B. Abdominal Examination

| Sign | Significance |
|---|---|
| **Palpable abdominal mass** | Right iliac fossa mass (caecal/ascending colon cancer); may also be palpable in left iliac fossa (sigmoid cancer). A mass suggests at least T3/T4 disease |
| **Hepatomegaly** (irregular, hard, nodular) | Liver metastases |
| **Ascites** (shifting dullness, fluid thrill) | Peritoneal carcinomatosis or massive liver metastases |
| **Abdominal distension + tympanic percussion** | Bowel obstruction; distended loops of large bowel |
| **Visible peristalsis** | Obstructed bowel proximal to tumour (more common in thin patients) |
| **Tenderness / peritonism** | Perforation (generalised peritonitis) or localised abscess |
| **High-pitched / tinkling bowel sounds** | Mechanical bowel obstruction (bowel trying to push content past obstruction) |
| **Absent bowel sounds** | Late obstruction / peritonitis (paralytic ileus) |

#### C. Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)

> DRE is **mandatory** in any patient with suspected CRC. Up to 75% of rectal cancers are palpable on DRE.

| Finding | Significance |
|---|---|
| **Palpable rectal mass** | Hard, irregular, ulcerated, fixed or tethered mass suggests rectal cancer. Note: distance from anal verge (determines surgical approach — APR vs. LAR), size, circumferential involvement, fixity (mobile vs. tethered vs. fixed to pelvic structures) |
| **Blood on examining finger** | Suggests mucosal lesion (tumour, polyp, or other pathology) |
| **Sphincter tone assessment** | Important pre-operatively, especially if considering sphincter-sparing surgery |
| **Anterior rectal wall invasion** | In males: assess prostate involvement. In females: assess rectovaginal septum |

#### D. Stoma Examination (if applicable — post-surgical patient)

Post-operative patients may present with stoma complications:
- ***Parastomal hernia, stomal prolapse, stomal stenosis*** (late complications) [1]
- ***Skin excoriation*** (especially ileostomy — high alkaline enzymatic effluent) [1]

### 9.4 Paraneoplastic Manifestations (Uncommon but Examinable)

| Manifestation | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Nephrotic syndrome (membranous nephropathy) | Tumour antigens deposited in glomerular basement membrane |
| Dermatomyositis | Immune-mediated paraneoplastic phenomenon |
| Venous thromboembolism (Trousseau syndrome) | Tumour-derived tissue factor and mucin activate the coagulation cascade → hypercoagulable state |
| Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia | S. bovis (now S. gallolyticus) bacteraemia or endocarditis is strongly associated with occult CRC — always colonoscope these patients! |

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl">
***Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis) bacteraemia = COLONOSCOPY.*** The association is so strong that any patient with S. gallolyticus bacteraemia or endocarditis should have a colonoscopy to rule out CRC or colonic polyps, regardless of other symptoms.

## 10. Comparison: Right-Sided vs. Left-Sided CRC

| Feature | Right-Sided | Left-Sided / Rectal |
|---|---|---|
| Morphology | Polypoid / fungating / exophytic | Annular / constricting ("apple core") |
| Luminal diameter | Wide | Narrow |
| Stool consistency at site | Liquid | Formed |
| Typical presentation | Iron deficiency anaemia, occult blood, RIF mass, weight loss | Change in bowel habit, PR bleeding, obstruction, tenesmus |
| Obstruction | Uncommon | Common |
| Molecular | More likely MSI-H, BRAF mutant, CMS1 | More likely CIN, CMS2 |
| Response to anti-EGFR | Poorer | Better (if RAS/BRAF wild-type) |
| Prognosis (stage IV) | Worse | Better |

## 11. Prognostic Determinants (Included here for completeness — will be expanded in Management section)

> ***Nodal involvement is the single MOST important prognostic factor in CRC*** [1].

- ***4 or more involved LN predicts a poor survival*** [1].
- ***T stage is the single most significant predictor of LN metastasis:*** T1 = 5%, T2 = 20%, T3–4 = > 50% [1].
- ***Lymphovascular invasion*** [1]
- ***Perineural invasion*** [1]
- ***Grade of differentiation*** (well vs. poorly differentiated) [1]
- ***Molecular factors: MMR deficiency, RAS and BRAF mutation status*** [1]

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Definition**: CRC = adenocarcinoma of the colon/rectum (> 95%). Arises from adenoma-carcinoma sequence over ~10 years.

**Epidemiology (HK)**: Commonest cancer; > 90% aged ≥ 50; M > F (1.3:1); 2nd leading cause of cancer death.

**Risk Factors**: Age > 50, male, family history (10–15%), hereditary syndromes (FAP, Lynch — 10%), IBD (UC > CD), red/processed meat, low fibre, alcohol, smoking, obesity, DM, acromegaly. Protective: exercise, fibre, aspirin/NSAIDs.

**Key Hereditary Syndromes**:
- FAP: APC gene, AD, hundreds of polyps, 100% CRC if untreated → prophylactic colectomy.
- Lynch: MMR genes (MLH1 most common), AD, 70–80% CRC risk, right-sided, rapid adenoma-carcinoma, Amsterdam 3-2-1 rule → annual colonoscopy from age 20–25.

**Pathogenesis**: (1) CIN pathway (APC → K-RAS → SMAD4 → p53) — 60–85%; (2) MSI pathway (MMR deficiency) — 15%; (3) Serrated pathway.

**Clinical Features by Site**:
- Right-sided: IDA, occult bleeding, RIF mass.
- Left-sided: change in bowel habit, PR bleeding, obstruction.
- Rectal: fresh PR bleeding, tenesmus, mucus discharge.
- Emergencies: LBO (commonest cause in adults), perforation, haemorrhage.

**Metastasis**: Liver first (portal drainage) except distal rectum → lung first (systemic drainage). Regional LN most common overall.

**Key Signs**: Pallor, palpable mass, hepatomegaly, Virchow's node, Sister Mary Joseph nodule, DRE mass. DRE is mandatory.

**Prognosis**: LN involvement is the single most important prognostic factor. 5-year survival: Stage I 90%, II 60–80%, III 60%, IV 10%.
