### Etiology & Pathophysiology

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="What is the adenoma-carcinoma sequence? Name the four key genes in order.">
**Most CRC arises from adenomatous polyps** by accumulation of mutations over **~10–15 years** (chromosomal instability / CIN pathway, **60–85%** of sporadic CRC).

Gene sequence:
1. **APC loss** (5q) — gatekeeper; β-catenin accumulates → initiates polyp
2. **K-RAS activation** (12p) — oncogene; locks RAS in "ON" state → uncontrolled proliferation
3. **DCC/SMAD4 loss** (18q) — removes TGF-β growth brake
4. **TP53 loss** (17p) — guardian of genome; allows carcinoma transformation

**Key point**: APC inactivation alone does NOT cause carcinoma — it sets the stage for accumulation of further mutations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compare the three subtypes of adenomatous polyps and their malignancy risk.">
| Subtype | Malignancy Risk | Key Feature |
|---|---|---|
| **Tubular adenoma** | Up to **5%** | **Most common** type |
| **Tubulovillous adenoma** | Up to **22%** | Intermediate |
| **Villous adenoma** | Up to **40%** | Secretes **K⁺-rich mucus** → secretory diarrhoea and **hypokalaemia** |

**Advanced adenoma** = any one of: **high-grade dysplasia, size > 1 cm, villous histology**.

**Hyperplastic polyps are NOT pre-malignant** (except rare serrated polyposis syndrome) — only adenomatous polyps carry meaningful malignant potential.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the MSI pathway? Why does MSI-H status matter for treatment?">
**Microsatellite instability (MSI) pathway** = ~**15%** of sporadic CRC. Defective **DNA mismatch repair (MMR)** genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) → errors accumulate in microsatellite regions → frameshift mutations.

In sporadic CRC: usually caused by **epigenetic MLH1 promoter hypermethylation** (not germline). Associated with BRAF V600E mutation, right-sided, mucinous, poorly differentiated.

**Treatment implications:**
- MSI-H Stage II → **does NOT benefit from 5-FU** (may be harmful) → withhold chemo
- MSI-H Stage IV → **excellent response to immune checkpoint inhibitors** (pembrolizumab first-line) due to high neoantigen burden
- Paradoxically **better prognosis** stage-for-stage
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compare FAP and Lynch syndrome across 5 key domains.">
| Feature | **FAP** | **Lynch Syndrome (HNPCC)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Gene** | **APC** (5q21) | **MMR genes: MLH1** (most common), MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 |
| **Inheritance** | **AD** | **AD** |
| **Polyps** | **Hundreds to thousands** | Few (but rapid adenoma → carcinoma) |
| **CRC risk** | **~100% if untreated** by age 40–50 | **~70–80%** lifetime |
| **Surgery** | Total proctocolectomy + **IPAA** | Total colectomy + **IRA** |

**Lynch diagnostic criteria (Amsterdam 3-2-1 rule)**: ≥ **3** relatives with Lynch-associated cancer, ≥ **2** successive generations, ≥ **1** diagnosed before age **50**.

**Lynch** = **most common** inherited CRC syndrome (~3% of all CRC). **FAP** = most dramatic phenotype.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why does the site of CRC determine the clinical presentation? Compare right-sided vs left-sided.">
| Feature | **Right-Sided** | **Left-Sided / Rectal** |
|---|---|---|
| **Luminal diameter** | Wide | Narrow |
| **Stool** | Liquid | Formed |
| **Morphology** | Polypoid / fungating | Annular / constricting ("apple core") |
| **Presentation** | **IDA**, occult bleeding, RIF mass, weight loss | **Change in bowel habit**, PR bleeding, obstruction, tenesmus |
| **Obstruction** | Uncommon | Common |
| **Molecular** | More MSI-H, BRAF mutant | More CIN, CMS2 |

**Metastasis pattern**: **Liver** first (portal drainage) — except **distal rectal** cancers → **lung first** (inferior rectal veins drain via IVC, bypassing portal system).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the single most important prognostic factor in CRC? State the T stage–LN risk relationship.">
**Nodal involvement** is the single most important prognostic factor.

| T Stage | LN Metastasis Risk |
|---|---|
| T1 | **5%** |
| T2 | **20%** |
| T3–4 | **> 50%** |

**≥ 4 involved LN** predicts poor survival. A minimum of **12 LN** must be harvested for adequate staging.

5-year survival: **Stage I 90%**, **Stage II 60–80%**, **Stage III ~60%**, **Stage IV ~10%**.

### Differential Diagnosis

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="What is the most important DDx of sigmoid CRC? How do you distinguish them on CT?">
**Diverticulitis** — the most important differential and a classic exam scenario.

| Feature | Diverticulitis | Sigmoid CRC |
|---|---|---|
| **Onset** | Acute (hours–days) | Chronic/insidious |
| **CT: segment length** | **> 10 cm** involvement | Focal mass |
| **CT: lymph nodes** | **No enlarged pericolonic LN** | **Enlarged LN** |
| **CT: fat stranding** | Pericolonic inflammation | Shouldering, irregular wall thickening |

**Critical principle**: **CRC can only be excluded with colonoscopy after resolution of acute inflammation** (6–8 weeks). CT alone cannot distinguish them reliably.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="List the four most common causes of large bowel obstruction in adults.">
1. **Cancer of the colon** (commonest cause)
2. **Volvulus** (sigmoid or caecal)
3. **Diverticular stricture**
4. **Pseudo-obstruction** (Ogilvie's syndrome)

Always **examine hernial orifices** (incarcerated hernia) and perform a **DRE** — don't forget the basics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why should you never attribute PR bleeding solely to haemorrhoids in a patient ≥ 50?">
**Haemorrhoids are the most common cause of PR bleeding in age < 50**, but they commonly **co-exist** with CRC. Attributing bleeding to haemorrhoids without colonoscopy risks missing an underlying CRC.

Red flags mandating colonoscopy even if haemorrhoids are present: **age ≥ 50**, family history of CRC, change in bowel habit, weight loss, anaemia, tenesmus, blood **mixed** with stool (not outlet-type), or positive FIT.

Key distinction: haemorrhoid bleeding is **outlet-type** (bright red, separate from stool, on paper, drips after defaecation). CRC bleeding is **mixed with stool**, often darker.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Name two conditions outside the GI tract that are strongly associated with CRC and mandate colonoscopy.">
1. **Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis) bacteraemia/endocarditis** — strong association with occult CRC or colonic adenomas. Always colonoscope these patients.

2. **Dermatomyositis** — paraneoplastic phenomenon; always screen for underlying malignancy including CRC.

Also: **Acromegaly** — **IGF-1 acts as a growth factor for colonic mucosal cells** → increased colonocyte turnover → increased CRC risk.
</Accordion>

### Diagnosis & Investigations

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="What is the gold standard investigation for CRC? What additional roles does colonoscopy serve?">
**Colonoscopy with biopsy** — histological confirmation of adenocarcinoma. No substitute.

Additional roles:
1. **Exclude synchronous cancers** (3–5%) and **synchronous polyps** (30–50%) — must be complete to caecum
2. **Pre-operative tattooing** — ink marks guide the surgeon intra-operatively for small tumours
3. **Therapeutic polypectomy** — remove polyps at the same session

If colonoscopy is incomplete (obstruction/intolerance): **CT colonography** (> 90% sensitivity for lesions ≥ 1 cm) or **water-soluble contrast (Gastrografin) enema**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is CEA NOT a diagnostic or screening test? What are its three clinical roles?">
CEA has **low sensitivity** (elevated in only ~50% of CRC; normal in **30–40%** of early disease) and **low specificity** (false positives: smoking, IBD, pregnancy, TB, other cancers).

Three clinical roles:
1. **Pre-operative baseline** — to facilitate surgical planning
2. **Post-operative monitoring** — rising CEA strongly suggests recurrence
3. **Prognostication** — very high pre-op CEA (> 200) suggests advanced disease

CEA takes **4–6 weeks** to normalise post-operatively. **If it doesn't normalise → suspect residual disease.**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is MRI pelvis mandatory for ALL rectal cancer but NOT routinely for colon cancer?">
**MRI is superior to CT** in delineating mesorectal fat planes for T staging of rectal cancer.

MRI answers three critical surgical questions:
1. **Can I get a clear CRM?** (CRM ≤ 1 mm = positive → predicts local recurrence)
2. **How deep has the tumour invaded?** (T staging)
3. **Are there involved lymph nodes?**

When **CRM is threatened** or **T3/4 or N+** → **neoadjuvant chemoRT** is indicated before surgery.

Colon cancer does not face the same anatomical constraints (no narrow bony pelvis, no sphincter preservation decisions), so **CT TAP suffices**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What molecular tests should be performed on all CRC? What additional tests for metastatic disease?">
**All CRC** → **Universal MMR/MSI testing** (IHC for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or PCR for MSI):
- Identifies **Lynch syndrome** even without family history
- Determines **chemotherapy benefit** (MSI-H Stage II → no 5-FU)
- Predicts **immunotherapy response** (MSI-H Stage IV → pembrolizumab)

**Metastatic CRC** → add **KRAS/NRAS/BRAF** mutation testing:
- **Mutant KRAS** → will **NOT respond** to anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab/panitumumab) — mutation is downstream of EGFR
- **BRAF V600E** → poor prognosis; targeted with encorafenib + cetuximab
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Describe the CRC follow-up schedule after curative resection. Why is it intensive early?">
| Time | Interval | Investigations |
|---|---|---|
| **Years 1–2** | **Every 3 months** | CEA, rigid sigmoidoscopy, LFT |
| **Year 3** | **Every 6 months** | As above |
| **Years 4–5** | **Yearly** | As above |
| **> 5 years** | **Remission** | Discharge or routine screening |
| **Imaging** | **CT TAP or PET-CT** yearly | Detect distant recurrence |
| **Colonoscopy** | 1 year post-op → 3 years → 5 years → Q5y | Synchronous/metachronous tumours |

**~40% develop recurrence**; **80%** within the first **3 years** — hence intensive early follow-up. Rising CEA + negative conventional imaging → **PET-CT** to localise occult recurrence.
</Accordion>

### Management

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="Summarise the stage-specific management of colon cancer.">
| Stage | Management | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| **I** (T1–2 N0) | **Surgery alone** | Adjuvant chemo does NOT improve survival. 5-yr survival ~90% |
| **II** (T3–4 N0) | Surgery **± adjuvant chemo** (only if high-risk) | High-risk: T4, LVI, PNI, < 12 LN, poor differentiation, obstruction/perforation. **MSI-H Stage II → NO 5-FU** |
| **III** (Any T, N+) | Surgery **+ adjuvant chemo** | **FOLFOX 6 months** (or Xelox 3 months for low-risk T1–3 N1) |
| **IV** (M1) | Chemo ± surgery for resectable mets | **20%** of liver mets resectable; 5-yr survival improves from 20% to **40–50%** with resection |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the three indications for neoadjuvant chemoRT in rectal cancer?">
1. **Resectable but locally advanced**: T3/T4, N+, threatened CRM (< 2 mm) — to **sterilise tumour bed** and ↓ local recurrence
2. **Borderline resectable** — to **downstage** and ↑ resectability
3. **Low-lying tumour** — to **downsize** and ↑ sphincter preservation rate (may convert APR → LAR)

**No role for neoadjuvant therapy in colon cancer** — this is rectal cancer only.

Standard HK regimen: **long-course chemoRT** (5-FU + concurrent RT 50.4 Gy over 28 fractions → wait 8–10 weeks → surgery).

**Clinical complete remission (~20%)**: consider **"watch and wait"** protocol with intensive surveillance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is TME? Why has it revolutionised rectal cancer surgery?">
**Total Mesorectal Excision** = precise dissection along the **"holy plane"** (avascular alveolar plane between presacral and mesorectal fascia) to remove the entire mesorectal envelope containing tumour, fat, lymph nodes, and vessels, while **preserving pelvic autonomic nerves**.

Benefits:
- Reduced local recurrence from **~30% to < 5%**
- Reduced genitourinary dysfunction (nerve preservation)
- Less blood loss

**Distal margin**: 2 cm (above distal mesorectal margin) or 1 cm (at/below). **CRM ≤ 1 mm = positive** → predicts recurrence.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When is Hartmann's operation performed and what does it involve?">
**Indication**: Emergency left-sided CRC with complications (obstruction, perforation, haemorrhage) — when primary anastomosis is unsafe.

**Procedure**:
1. **Sigmoid resection** — remove diseased segment
2. **End colostomy at LIF** — proximal bowel brought out as stoma
3. **Closure of rectal stump**
4. **Reversal in 2–3 months** — second operation to restore continuity

**Why not primary anastomosis?** In emergency, bowel is unprepared (faecally loaded), oedematous, peritoneum contaminated → anastomosis has very high leak rate → faecal peritonitis, sepsis, death.

**Alternative**: endoluminal stenting as **bridge to elective surgery** (avoids emergency surgery, ↓ stoma rate).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compare anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF targeted therapy. When is each used?">
| | **Anti-EGFR** (cetuximab, panitumumab) | **Anti-VEGF** (bevacizumab) |
|---|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Blocks EGFR receptor | Blocks VEGF-A (anti-angiogenesis) |
| **Indication** | **Wild-type KRAS/BRAF, left-sided** mCRC | **RAS/BRAF mutant** mCRC (when anti-EGFR contraindicated) |
| **Key side effect** | **Acneiform rash**, hypomagnesaemia | **Haemorrhage, impaired wound healing, thrombosis** |
| **Contraindication** | Mutant KRAS (constitutive RAS activation → resistance) | Heart failure, active bleeding, recent surgery |

**Both are Stage IV only** — no evidence for targeted therapy in adjuvant setting.

**MSI-H/dMMR mCRC** → **pembrolizumab** (anti-PD-1) is first-line (KEYNOTE-177).

### Complications

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="What is closed-loop obstruction in CRC and why is the caecum at risk of perforation?">
When a **left-sided CRC** obstructs the lumen and the **ileocaecal valve is competent** (~1/3 of population), a **closed loop** forms — colon is obstructed distally by tumour and proximally by the valve.

Pressure builds within the closed loop. By the **Law of Laplace** (wall tension = pressure × radius), the **caecum** has the **greatest radius** → highest wall tension → most vulnerable to perforation.

**Caecal diameter > 12 cm on AXR** = critical perforation risk → surgical emergency.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Describe anastomotic leak: timing, clinical signs, risk factors, and management.">
**Most feared complication** of colorectal surgery. Mortality 10–20%.

- **Timing**: typically **day 5–7** post-op
- **Signs**: **pain, fever, tachycardia, feculent/purulent drainage**. Unexplained tachycardia on day 5–7 = leak until proven otherwise
- **Risk factors**: left-sided/low rectal anastomosis (highest risk), male sex, previous RT, malnutrition, steroids, emergency surgery, no diverting stoma
- **Management**: fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, bowel rest, image-guided percutaneous drainage, temporary faecal diversion or resection

**A defunctioning loop ileostomy does NOT decrease the leak rate**, but decreases the **complication rate and reoperation risk** when a leak occurs (faecal stream diverted).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is LAR syndrome? State its pathophysiology and four management options.">
**Low Anterior Resection Syndrome** = change in bowel movement (constipation to faecal urgency/incontinence) persisting **≥ 1 month** after surgery. Affects **60–90%** of LAR patients.

**Pathophysiology**:
1. **Colonic dysmotility** — denervation from pelvic dissection
2. **Neorectal reservoir dysfunction** — colon lacks compliance of native rectum → reduced capacity → urgency
3. **Anal sphincter dysfunction** — direct damage or nerve injury

**Management**:
1. **Antidiarrhoeal agents** (loperamide)
2. **Transanal irrigation** (retrograde washout)
3. **Pelvic floor rehabilitation**
4. **Sacral nerve stimulation** (pacemaker for pelvic nerves)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Explain the autonomic nerve injury consequences in rectal surgery: sympathetic vs parasympathetic.">
| | **Sympathetic** (Hypogastric nerves) | **Parasympathetic** (Pelvic splanchnic S2–S4) |
|---|---|---|
| **Function** | Bladder neck tone; ejaculation | Detrusor contraction (emptying); erection |
| **Injury consequence** | **Incontinence** (bladder neck incompetence); **ejaculatory failure** (retrograde/anejaculation) | **Urinary retention** (detrusor underactivity); **erectile dysfunction** |

**High tie of IMA** (at origin) → risk of hypogastric nerve damage. **Low tie** (distal to left colic) → avoids this.

TME along the "holy plane" is specifically designed to preserve these nerves.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Differentiate post-polypectomy syndrome from true perforation.">
| Feature | **Post-Polypectomy Syndrome** | **True Perforation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Pathology** | Transmural burn **WITHOUT** perforation | Full-thickness bowel wall **breach** |
| **Imaging** | **NO free air** | **Free air** on erect CXR/CT |
| **Presentation** | Fever, focal tenderness, leucocytosis (1–5 days post-polypectomy) | Sudden severe pain, generalised peritonism, sepsis |
| **Management** | **Conservative** (IV antibiotics, bowel rest) | **Surgical repair** (or endoscopic clipping if small/contained) |

**CT scan** is the key differentiator — look for free intraperitoneal air.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Name the key side effects of the three main CRC chemotherapy drugs.">
| Drug | Class | **Key Side Effect** |
|---|---|---|
| **5-FU / Capecitabine** | Pyrimidine analogue | **Mucositis, diarrhoea, myelosuppression**; capecitabine → **hand-foot syndrome** (painful palms/soles) |
| **Oxaliplatin** | Platinum compound | **Peripheral sensory neuropathy** (cold-triggered — "can't open the fridge"); cumulative, dose-limiting |
| **Irinotecan** | Topoisomerase I inhibitor | **Delayed diarrhoea** (cholinergic); acute cholinergic syndrome |

**DPD deficiency** (~3–8%): rate-limiting enzyme for 5-FU metabolism. Deficiency → lethal 5-FU toxicity. **Pre-treatment DPYD genotyping** now recommended.
