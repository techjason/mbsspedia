## Differential Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer

The differential diagnosis of CRC is really the differential of **its presenting symptoms**. Since CRC has protean presentations — anaemia, change in bowel habit, PR bleeding, abdominal mass, bowel obstruction — you need to think about what else can cause each of those symptom complexes. The key clinical skill is to **never dismiss these symptoms** until CRC has been excluded, especially in patients ≥ 50.

Let me organise the differentials by the three major clinical presentations, then provide a unifying approach.

---

### 1. Approach to Differential Diagnosis by Presentation

#### 1A. Iron Deficiency Anaemia / Occult GI Blood Loss (Typically Right-Sided CRC)

This is the classic presentation of right-sided CRC — the patient presents to a GP or medical clinic with fatigue, pallor, and microcytic anaemia. The differential includes any cause of chronic GI blood loss:

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Can Mimic CRC |
|---|---|---|
| ***Angiodysplasia*** | Most common in age > 65; dilated tortuous submucosal vessels lacking smooth muscle; often in caecum/ascending colon; bleeding is venous and tends to be less massive than diverticular bleeding [1] | Right-sided location, occult blood loss, presents as IDA in elderly — identical to right-sided CRC |
| **Peptic ulcer disease** | Epigastric pain, NSAID/H. pylori history; may cause IDA from chronic erosive gastritis or ulcer ooze | Upper GI cause of IDA that must be excluded — always do OGD as well as colonoscopy in unexplained IDA |
| **Coeliac disease** | Malabsorption (diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, weight loss), anti-tTG antibodies positive; iron malabsorption rather than blood loss | Can cause IDA through poor duodenal iron absorption; younger patients; must consider in IDA workup |
| **Gastric cancer** | Weight loss, early satiety, epigastric mass; more common in East Asia | Chronic occult blood loss; like CRC can cause IDA |
| ***Diverticular bleeding*** | ***Painless profuse haematochezia*** — typically acute and self-limiting rather than chronic; right-sided diverticula common in Asians [1] | Can cause chronic low-grade blood loss, but usually presents acutely rather than insidiously |

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl" type="idea">
In any patient with unexplained iron deficiency anaemia (especially males of any age and post-menopausal females), the standard approach is **"top and tail" — OGD + colonoscopy**. You need to exclude both upper and lower GI malignancy. Don't stop at finding one lesion — synchronous pathology is common.
</Callout>

#### 1B. Change in Bowel Habit / PR Bleeding / Tenesmus (Typically Left-Sided / Rectal CRC)

This is the presentation that most clinicians associate with CRC. The differential includes conditions that cause similar symptoms:

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Can Mimic CRC |
|---|---|---|
| ***Diverticular disease / Diverticulitis*** | ***Similar clinical features and bowel wall thickening on CT*** [2]. Features suggestive of diverticulitis over CRC on CT: pericolonic/mesenteric inflammation, involvement of > 10 cm of colon, ***absence of enlarged pericolonic lymph nodes*** [2]. ***CRC can only be excluded with colonoscopy after resolution of acute inflammation*** [2] | Left-sided, change in bowel habit, LLQ pain, PR bleeding, can cause stricture and obstruction — almost identical to sigmoid CRC |
| ***Inflammatory bowel disease (UC and Crohn's)*** | ***Diarrhoea rather than abdominal pain is the predominant symptom*** [2]. Younger patients; chronic relapsing course; extra-intestinal manifestations (arthritis, uveitis, erythema nodosum); UC = bloody diarrhoea with mucus; Crohn's = RLQ pain, perianal disease, skip lesions [2][3] | Chronic PR bleeding, change in bowel habit, weight loss, anaemia; and IBD itself is a risk factor for CRC (dysplasia-carcinoma sequence) |
| ***Haemorrhoids*** | ***Fresh outlet-type bleed***, blood separate from stool (drips after defaecation or on toilet paper), ***perianal mass/pain***, associated with constipation/straining [4]. Most common cause of PR bleeding in age < 50 [1] | Bright red PR bleeding — but haemorrhoidal bleeding is characteristically "outlet-type" (separate from stool, on paper, dripping into bowl). **Critical point: never attribute PR bleeding to haemorrhoids in a patient ≥ 50 without a colonoscopy** |
| ***Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)*** | ***Chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of an organic cause*** [3]. Rome IV criteria: recurrent abdominal pain ≥ 1 day/week in last 3 months, related to defaecation, with change in stool frequency/form. No red flag features (no weight loss, no PR bleeding, no anaemia, no nocturnal symptoms) | Alternating constipation/diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort — overlaps with left-sided CRC. IBS is a **diagnosis of exclusion** — if red flags present, must colonoscope |
| ***Infectious colitis*** | ***Diarrhoea rather than abdominal pain is the predominant symptom*** [2]. Acute onset; stool cultures positive (E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, C. difficile); travel history, antibiotic use [3] | Acute bloody diarrhoea, abdominal cramps — can mimic acute presentation of CRC; C. difficile particularly relevant in hospitalised patients |
| ***Ischaemic colitis*** | ***Rapid onset of abdominal pain, haematochezia or bloody diarrhoea*** [2]. Risk factors: advanced age, hypertension, DM, atherosclerosis, AF, dehydration, laxative use [2]. Watershed areas (splenic flexure, rectosigmoid) affected. CT shows thumbprinting (submucosal oedema) | Elderly patient with LLQ pain and PR bleeding — similar demographic to CRC. Colonoscopy shows segmental mucosal ischaemia |
| ***Radiation colitis / proctitis*** | History of abdominal/pelvic radiotherapy (cervical, prostate, rectal cancer); can occur weeks to years after irradiation [1][3]. Telangiectasias on endoscopy | PR bleeding, tenesmus, diarrhoea — similar to rectal cancer. History of previous pelvic RT is the key distinguishing feature |
| **Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome** | ***Presents with abdominal pain, altered bowel habits and bleeding; characteristic histology with thickened mucosal layer and distortion of crypt architecture*** [3]. Associated with rectal prolapse and excessive straining | PR bleeding and tenesmus — can mimic low rectal cancer. Biopsy is essential to differentiate |
| ***Anal fissure*** | Severe pain on defaecation with small amount of bright red blood on paper; visible tear on inspection (usually posterior midline); associated with constipation and hypertonic sphincter | Outlet-type PR bleeding with pain — rarely confused with CRC, but included in the differential of any PR bleeding |

#### 1C. Bowel Obstruction (Emergency Presentation)

***CRC is the commonest cause of large bowel obstruction (LBO) in adults*** [5][6].

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|
| ***Sigmoid/caecal volvulus*** | Sigmoid volvulus: elderly, institutionalised, psychiatric patients, chronic constipation; "coffee bean" sign on AXR. Caecal volvulus: younger patients, mobile caecum |
| ***Diverticular stricture*** | History of recurrent diverticulitis → fibrotic stricture; CT shows long segment thickening without mass or lymphadenopathy; ***CRC cannot be excluded until colonoscopy after inflammation resolves*** [2] |
| ***Pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome)*** | Massive colonic dilation without mechanical obstruction; post-operative, electrolyte disturbance, opioids; no transition point on CT |
| ***Hernia (incarcerated)*** | Examine hernial orifices — always check! An incarcerated inguinal or femoral hernia can cause LBO |
| ***Adhesions*** | More typically cause small bowel obstruction (SBO) than LBO; history of previous abdominal surgery |
| ***Crohn's stricture*** | History of known Crohn's disease; can cause stricturing at any point in the GI tract |

<Callout title="Exam Tip" type="error">
***In any patient with large bowel obstruction, the four common causes to remember are: Cancer of colon, Volvulus, Diverticular stricture, Pseudo-obstruction*** [6]. Always examine hernial orifices and do a digital rectal examination — don't forget the basics.
</Callout>

#### 1D. Abdominal Mass

When a palpable abdominal mass is the presenting feature:

| Location | Differential Considerations |
|---|---|
| **Right iliac fossa mass** | CRC (caecal/ascending colon), Crohn's disease (ileocaecal mass/phlegmon/abscess), appendicular mass/abscess, ovarian pathology (torsion, tumour), ileocaecal TB, lymphoma |
| **Left iliac fossa mass** | CRC (sigmoid), diverticular abscess/phlegmon, ovarian pathology, constipated sigmoid colon (faecal loading) |
| **Epigastric / central** | Transverse colon CRC, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, omental metastatic cake, lymphoma |

#### 1E. Hepatomegaly / Liver Metastases

When the presenting complaint is from the liver rather than the bowel:

> ***Metastatic carcinoma to the liver is commoner than primary liver cancer. The commonest site of primary is the GI tract (portal venous circulation): colorectal, stomach, pancreas*** [7].

| Differential of Liver Mass/Hepatomegaly | Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|
| **CRC liver metastases** | Multiple lesions, elevated CEA, primary CRC found on colonoscopy |
| ***Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)*** | Background of chronic liver disease/cirrhosis, elevated AFP, arterial enhancement on CT |
| **Other GI metastases** (gastric, pancreatic) | Epigastric symptoms, elevated CA 19-9 |
| **Hepatic abscess** (amoebic/pyogenic) | Fever, RUQ pain, travel history; single/few lesions with rim enhancement |
| **Haemangioma** | Asymptomatic, incidental, characteristic peripheral nodular enhancement on CT |

### 2. Specific Conditions That Closely Mimic CRC

Some conditions deserve special emphasis because they are **diagnostic pitfalls**:

#### 2A. Diverticulitis vs. Sigmoid CRC

This is the most important differential in clinical practice and ***one of the most common exam scenarios*** [2].

| Feature | Diverticulitis | Sigmoid CRC |
|---|---|---|
| Onset | Acute (hours to days) | Chronic/insidious (weeks to months) |
| Pain | LLQ pain, constant, with tenderness | Colicky pain, change in bowel habit |
| CT findings | Pericolonic fat stranding, ***involvement > 10 cm***, diverticula seen, ***no enlarged LN*** [2] | Focal mass, ***enlarged pericolonic LN***, shouldering/irregular wall thickening |
| Colonoscopy | Deferred until acute inflammation resolves (6–8 weeks) | Diagnostic — mass with biopsy |
| Key principle | ***CRC can only be excluded with colonoscopy after resolution of acute inflammation*** [2] | — |

**Why is this so important?** Because on CT, an inflamed segment of sigmoid with diverticulitis can look identical to a perforated sigmoid cancer. You cannot safely colonoscope during acute diverticulitis (risk of perforation), so you must wait, treat conservatively, then scope. If you don't scope, you will miss cancers.

#### 2B. Haemorrhoids vs. Rectal CRC

> ***Haemorrhoids are the most common cause of PR bleeding in patients aged < 50*** [1], but they also commonly co-exist with CRC. **Never assume haemorrhoids are the sole diagnosis in a patient with red flag symptoms.**

Red flags mandating colonoscopy even if haemorrhoids are present: age ≥ 50, family history of CRC, change in bowel habit, weight loss, anaemia, tenesmus, mixed blood with stool (not just outlet-type), or positive FIT.

### 4. How to Distinguish CRC from Its Key Differentials: Summary Table

| Feature | Favours CRC | Favours Alternative Diagnosis |
|---|---|---|
| Age ≥ 50 | ✓ (dominant risk factor) | Younger age more typical of IBD, IBS, haemorrhoids |
| Chronicity | Insidious, progressive over weeks-months | Acute onset (diverticulitis, ischaemic colitis, infectious) |
| Weight loss / anorexia | ✓ (cancer cachexia) | Absent in haemorrhoids, IBS |
| PR bleeding pattern | Dark blood mixed with stool | Outlet-type (haemorrhoids), bloody diarrhoea (IBD, infectious) |
| Change in stool calibre | ✓ (annular constricting lesion) | Not typical of other conditions |
| Tenesmus | ✓ (rectal mass) | Can occur with proctitis (IBD, radiation) |
| Family history of CRC / polyps | ✓ | Family history of IBD, coeliac, etc. |
| Iron deficiency anaemia (male/post-menopausal female) | ✓ — CRC until proven otherwise | Coeliac, menorrhagia (pre-menopausal), angiodysplasia |
| CT: focal mass + enlarged LN | ✓ | Long-segment inflammation without LN (diverticulitis) |
| ***Colonoscopy: endoluminal mass with friability, induration, ulceration*** [3] | ✓ (diagnostic gold standard with biopsy) | Normal mucosa, diverticula, inflammatory changes, etc. |

---

### 5. Don't Forget These Associations

| Association | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| ***Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) bacteraemia → CRC*** | Always colonoscope — strong association with CRC/adenomas |
| ***Acromegaly → CRC*** | ***IGF-1 as growth factor for colonic mucosal cells*** [8] |
| ***IBD (especially UC) → CRC*** | Dysplasia-carcinoma sequence; risk increases with duration > 8–10 years |
| ***Hereditary syndromes (FAP, Lynch) → CRC*** | Family history + early-onset CRC = genetic testing + extended surveillance |
| ***Dermatomyositis in an older patient → occult malignancy (including CRC)*** | Paraneoplastic; always screen for underlying cancer |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Key Differentials by Presentation:**

1. **IDA / occult blood loss (right-sided pattern):** CRC, angiodysplasia, PUD, coeliac disease, gastric cancer → investigate with "top and tail" (OGD + colonoscopy).

2. **Change in bowel habit / PR bleeding (left-sided/rectal):** CRC, diverticular disease (most important DDx — cannot exclude CRC without colonoscopy after acute episode resolves), IBD, haemorrhoids, IBS, infectious/ischaemic colitis, radiation proctitis. Never attribute PR bleeding to haemorrhoids in ≥ 50 without colonoscopy.

3. **Large bowel obstruction:** CRC (commonest cause in adults), volvulus, diverticular stricture, pseudo-obstruction. Always check hernial orifices and do DRE.

4. **Abdominal mass:** CRC, diverticular abscess, Crohn's phlegmon, appendicular mass, ovarian pathology.

5. **Liver mass/hepatomegaly:** CRC liver mets (commonest cause of liver secondaries from GI), HCC, other GI mets, abscess.

**Critical pitfall:** Diverticulitis vs. sigmoid CRC — CT alone cannot distinguish; colonoscopy after inflammation resolves is mandatory.
