## Complications of CA Stomach

Complications of gastric cancer can be broadly divided into two categories:

1. **Complications of the disease itself** (from the tumour)
2. **Complications of treatment** (from surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy)

Understanding these requires connecting the pathophysiology of the tumour and the consequences of removing a major digestive organ.

---

### I. Complications of the Disease (Tumour-Related)

These arise directly from the tumour's growth, invasion, ulceration, and metastasis.

#### A. ***Bleeding (Haemorrhage)*** [3][19]

**Mechanism:** The tumour ulcerates through the gastric mucosa → erosion of submucosal and mucosal blood vessels → bleeding into the GI lumen. This can be:

- **Chronic occult bleeding** → ***iron-deficiency anaemia*** (hypochromic microcytic) [19]
  - Why iron deficiency? Chronic slow blood loss depletes iron stores faster than dietary intake can replenish them. Red blood cells cannot be loaded with haemoglobin without iron → microcytic, hypochromic anaemia.
  - Often insidious — the patient gradually becomes fatigued, pale, and short of breath without realising they are bleeding.
- **Acute overt bleeding** → ***haematemesis and melaena*** [19]
  - Haematemesis (vomiting blood) occurs when blood accumulates in the stomach; if slow, gastric acid converts haemoglobin to haematin → "coffee-ground" vomitus.
  - Melaena (black, tarry stools) occurs when blood is digested during transit through the GI tract.
  - Massive haemorrhage can present with haemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension, shock).

**Management:**
- **Acute:** Resuscitation (IV fluids, blood transfusion), urgent OGD with endoscopic haemostasis (adrenaline injection, clipping, thermal coagulation)
- **If endoscopy fails:** Transcatheter arterial embolisation (TAE) or palliative surgery [17]
- **Chronic:** Iron supplementation (oral or IV), PPI (reduces acid-mediated re-bleeding), blood transfusion as needed [17]
- ***Palliative resection for bleeding*** [5] — in unresectable disease with refractory bleeding, palliative gastrectomy removes the bleeding source
- ***External beam radiotherapy (EBRT)*** can reduce tumour vascularity and control bleeding [3][17]

#### B. ***Gastric Outlet Obstruction (GOO)*** [19]

**Mechanism:** Tumour at the antrum or pylorus progressively narrows the gastric outlet → food cannot pass into the duodenum → proximal gastric distension.

**Clinical features:**
- ***Abdominal distension*** [19]
- ***Vomiting*** — characteristically **non-bilious** (obstruction is proximal to the ampulla of Vater), **projectile**, containing **undigested food** eaten hours or days previously [19]
- Succussion splash (audible splash on shaking the abdomen > 3 hours post-prandially)
- Progressive weight loss and dehydration

**Metabolic consequences:**
- ***Risk of dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities including hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, and metabolic alkalosis*** [19]
  - **Why?** Repeated vomiting of gastric acid (HCl) → loss of H⁺ and Cl⁻ → **hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis**
  - Volume depletion → activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system → aldosterone promotes Na⁺ reabsorption in exchange for K⁺ and H⁺ excretion in the distal nephron → **hypokalaemia** + **paradoxical aciduria** (the kidneys excrete H⁺ to preserve K⁺ and Na⁺, worsening the alkalosis)
  - This is a classic exam concept: *vomiting → hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria*

- ***Risk of aspiration pneumonia*** [19] — retained gastric contents can be regurgitated and aspirated into the lungs, especially in debilitated patients or when lying flat

**Management:**
- ***"Drip and suck"*** — NPO, IV fluids (normal saline + KCl), nasogastric decompression [12]
- IV PPI to reduce gastric secretion
- ***Palliative bypass (GJ) for outlet obstruction*** [5] — gastrojejunostomy bypasses the obstructed pylorus
- ***Endoscopic stenting*** [5] — self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) across the obstructing tumour for rapid relief
- ***Systemic chemotherapy*** [5] — may shrink the tumour and relieve obstruction
- If resectable: curative gastrectomy addresses both the cancer and the obstruction

#### C. ***Perforation*** [19][2]

**Mechanism:** Tumour necrosis and ulceration → full-thickness erosion through the gastric wall → loss of wall integrity → gastric contents (acid, food, bacteria) leak into the peritoneal cavity.

**Consequence:** ***Leads to peritonitis*** [19]

**Clinical features:**
- Sudden-onset severe generalised abdominal pain
- Board-like rigidity (involuntary guarding) — generalised peritoneal inflammation causes reflex contraction of the abdominal wall muscles
- Absent bowel sounds (paralytic ileus from peritoneal irritation)
- Sepsis (fever, tachycardia, hypotension)
- CXR: **pneumoperitoneum** (free gas under the diaphragm — gas escapes from the perforated stomach)

**Management:**
- Emergency resuscitation (IV fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, analgesia)
- Emergency surgery: exploration, washout, and either primary repair with omental patch (if small perforation in a palliative setting) or gastrectomy (if tumour is resectable)
- This is a rare presentation of gastric cancer and carries a poor prognosis

#### D. Complications of Metastatic Disease

These are not "complications" in the traditional sense but rather the clinical consequences of tumour spread:

| Site of Metastasis | Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Liver** | Hepatomegaly, jaundice, liver failure, portal hypertension, ascites | Tumour replaces hepatic parenchyma → loss of synthetic and excretory function; compression of intrahepatic bile ducts; portal vein compression → portal hypertension |
| **Peritoneum** | Malignant ascites, bowel obstruction | Peritoneal carcinomatosis → increased peritoneal capillary permeability + lymphatic obstruction → fluid accumulation; tumour deposits on bowel serosa → adhesions and mechanical obstruction |
| **Ovaries (Krukenberg)** | Pelvic mass, abdominal distension | Transcoelomic spread of signet ring cells with tropism for ovarian stroma |
| **Bone** | Pathological fractures, bone pain, hypercalcaemia | Osteolytic or osteoblastic metastases weaken bone architecture; tumour-mediated osteoclast activation releases calcium |
| **Lung** | Dyspnoea, cough, haemoptysis, pleural effusion, lymphangitis carcinomatosis | Haematogenous spread → pulmonary parenchymal deposits; lymphatic obstruction → interstitial oedema and pleural effusion |
| **Brain** (rare) | Headache, focal neurological deficits, seizures | Space-occupying lesion → raised intracranial pressure |
| **Ureteric obstruction** | Hydronephrosis, acute renal failure | Pelvic or retroperitoneal tumour deposits compress the ureters |

#### E. Paraneoplastic Complications

These occur due to tumour-secreted substances, not direct invasion:

| Syndrome | Mechanism | Complication |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Trousseau's syndrome** | Mucin-secreting adenocarcinoma releases procoagulant substances (tissue factor, mucins) → hypercoagulable state | ***Migratory superficial thrombophlebitis***, DVT, PE |
| ***Nephrotic syndrome (membranous nephropathy)*** | Tumour antigens deposit in the glomerular basement membrane → immune complex formation → complement activation → podocyte damage [5] | Proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia, peripheral oedema |
| **Acanthosis nigricans** | Tumour-secreted growth factors (TGF-α, IGF) stimulate keratinocyte proliferation | Velvety hyperpigmentation of skin folds |
| **Dermatomyositis** | Autoimmune paraneoplastic process | Proximal muscle weakness, heliotrope rash |

---

### II. Complications of Treatment (Surgery-Related)

These are the complications that arise from gastrectomy and its reconstructions. They are best organised by timing.

#### A. ***General / Immediate Complications (Intra-operative / < 24 hours)*** [17][19]

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Bleeding*** | Intra-operative haemorrhage from splenic hilum, short gastric vessels, or staple lines | Intra-operative haemostasis; post-op: blood transfusion, correction of coagulopathy; re-exploration if ongoing |
| ***Injury to neighbouring structures*** | Surgical dissection near the pancreas, spleen, transverse colon, duodenum → inadvertent damage [17] | Intra-operative recognition and repair; e.g., splenectomy if splenic injury, repair of serosal tears |
| Pancreatic injury/fistula | D2 lymphadenectomy involves dissection along the superior border of the pancreas and splenic hilum → risk of pancreatic parenchymal injury | Drain management; octreotide; TPN if high-output fistula |

#### B. ***Early Complications (Days to Weeks Post-op)*** [17][19]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Wound infection*** | Contamination during GI surgery; patient often malnourished and immunocompromised | Erythema, swelling, purulent discharge at wound site | Wound care, antibiotics, drainage if abscess |
| ***Chest infection / Pneumonia*** | Post-operative pain limits deep breathing (splinting) → atelectasis → secondary infection; aspiration risk if vomiting | Fever, productive cough, reduced breath sounds, consolidation on CXR | Chest physiotherapy, antibiotics, early mobilisation |
| ***Post-operative ileus*** | Normal post-operative bowel paralysis from surgical handling, anaesthesia, opioids, electrolyte disturbance | Abdominal distension, absent bowel sounds, inability to pass flatus | NPO, NG tube, IV fluids, correct electrolytes; usually self-resolving |
| ***Anastomotic leak*** | Failure of the surgical join (oesophagojejunostomy, gastrojejunostomy, or jejunojejunostomy) to heal — due to ischaemia, tension, technical error, or patient factors (malnutrition, steroids, diabetes) | ***Usually appears POD 5–10*** [3][17]; fever, tachycardia, abdominal pain/peritonitis, feculent/purulent drain output; CT: extraluminal fluid/gas collection | ***NPO, IV fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics ± exploration and revision*** [17]; percutaneous drainage of collections; re-operation if haemodynamically unstable or peritonitis |
| ***Duodenal stump blowout*** | Specific to Billroth II / Roux-en-Y with closed duodenal stump; raised intraluminal pressure in the afferent loop → rupture of the duodenal closure | Sudden abdominal pain, peritonitis, bilious drain output | Emergency re-operation; ***consider tube duodenostomy if duodenal stump leak*** [17] |
| ***Chyle leak*** | Injury to lymphatic channels during D2 dissection (particularly around the coeliac axis) → chyle leaks into the peritoneal cavity | Milky drain output after resumption of enteral feeding; TG > 110 mg/dL in drain fluid | NPO + TPN (eliminates chyle production by removing enteral fat); octreotide; re-operation if > 1 L/day or not resolving |

<Callout title="Anastomotic Leak — The Most Feared Complication" type="error">
***Anastomotic leak after gastrectomy: OJ > GJ/JJ in frequency*** [17]. Oesophagojejunal (OJ) leaks are the most common and most dangerous because the oesophagus lacks a serosal layer (unlike bowel), making healing less reliable and leaks more likely. This is why patients are kept NPO for 5–7 days post-op, fed via a jejunostomy tube, and may undergo a contrast swallow (water-soluble) before oral intake is commenced to check for leak [3].
</Callout>

#### C. ***Late Complications (Weeks to Months/Years Post-op)*** [3][17]

These are the chronic sequelae of living without a stomach (or with a small gastric remnant). They are collectively known as **post-gastrectomy syndromes**.

##### 1. ***Anastomosis-Related Complications***

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Anastomotic stricture** | Fibrosis and scarring at the anastomosis → progressive narrowing | Endoscopic balloon dilatation; rarely surgical revision |
| ***Afferent loop syndrome*** | ***Mechanical obstruction of the afferent limb (Billroth II/Roux-en-Y) due to kinking, anastomotic narrowing, adhesions, volvulus, or internal herniation*** [3][17] | ***Conversion to Roux-en-Y / Braun enteroenterostomy*** [17] |
| ***Efferent loop syndrome*** | Obstruction of the efferent limb → GOO | Surgical revision |
| ***Internal hernia (Petersen's defect)*** | Bowel herniates through the mesenteric defect created during Roux-en-Y reconstruction | Surgical reduction and closure of defect |
| ***Jejuno-gastric intussusception*** | Efferent limb intussuscepts retrogradely into the gastric remnant → GOO | Surgical reduction |

**Afferent loop syndrome — in more detail** [3][17]:
- The afferent limb carries bile and pancreatic secretions from the duodenum to the gastrojejunal anastomosis
- If this limb becomes obstructed, bile and pancreatic juice accumulate → progressive distension
- ***Acute presentation: severe epigastric pain, non-bilious vomiting (bilious only after obstruction relieves), deranged LFT and raised amylase*** [17]
- ***Emergency: closed-loop obstruction → risk of duodenal stump blowout, obstructive jaundice, ascending cholangitis, pancreatitis*** [17]
  - Why? The accumulated bile and pancreatic juice transmit high pressure back to the biliopancreatic ductal system [3]
- ***Chronic presentation: post-prandial pain, intermittent bilious vomiting*** [17]
- ***Usually due to excessive length of afferent loop*** [17]
- ***Dx: CT abdomen (dilated afferent loop)*** [17]
- ***Mx: revise GJ / convert to Roux-en-Y / Braun enteroenterostomy*** [17]

##### 2. ***Motility-Related Complications (Post-Gastrectomy Syndromes)***

| Syndrome | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Dumping syndrome*** | ***Loss of pylorus → rapid gastric emptying of hyperosmolar carbohydrates → draw fluid into intestinal lumen and release vasoactive gut hormones*** [17] | | |
| — ***Early (15–30 min)*** | Osmotic fluid shift → intravascular hypovolaemia; rapid gut hormone (serotonin, VIP, neurotensin) release → vasomotor symptoms | ***Abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting/diarrhoea, vasomotor symptoms (sweating, flushing, palpitations, dizziness)*** [17] | ***Small frequent meals, avoid simple carbohydrates*** [17] |
| — ***Late (2–3 hours)*** | Rapid glucose absorption → exaggerated insulin secretion → ***post-prandial hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (PHH)*** [17] | Tremor, sweating, confusion, palpitations (neuroglycopaenic and adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycaemia) | Dietary modification; ***octreotide*** (inhibits insulin secretion and delays gut transit) [17] |
| ***Small stomach syndrome*** | Reduced gastric reservoir after gastrectomy → cannot accommodate normal meal volume | ***Early satiety*** [3][17] | Small frequent meals (6+ per day) |
| ***Gastric stasis*** | ***Impaired gastric emptying due to post-operative atony / vagal denervation*** [17] | Nausea, vomiting, bloating, retained food | ***Prokinetics (metoclopramide, erythromycin)*** [17] |
| ***Alkaline reflux gastritis*** | Bile reflux into the gastric remnant (especially after Billroth II where the afferent loop delivers bile directly to the gastric stump) | Epigastric burning pain, bilious vomiting, endoscopic appearance of inflamed, bile-stained mucosa | PPI, sucralfate, cholestyramine (bile acid binder); conversion to Roux-en-Y if refractory |
| ***Roux stasis syndrome*** | ***Ectopic pacemakers in the Roux limb → net propulsive activity directed proximally towards the stomach rather than distally*** [17] — the Roux limb effectively pushes contents backwards | ***Bloating, nausea/vomiting, heartburn, delayed regurgitation*** [17] | Prokinetics (metoclopramide, erythromycin); surgical shortening of Roux limb |
| ***Post-vagotomy diarrhoea*** | ***Alteration in gastric emptying and vagal denervation of the small bowel and biliary tree*** [3] — bile acid malabsorption and rapid small bowel transit | ***Watery, episodic diarrhoea*** (occurs in ~20% after truncal vagotomy) [3] | Decrease excessive fluid intake, avoid lactose; ***antidiarrhoeal medications (loperamide)*** [3]; cholestyramine (binds bile acids) |

<Callout title="Understanding Dumping Syndrome From First Principles" type="idea">
The pylorus normally acts as a "gatekeeper" — it meters out small amounts of chyme into the duodenum in a controlled fashion. When you remove the pylorus (distal gastrectomy) or bypass it entirely (total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y), hyperosmolar food (especially simple sugars) rushes into the small bowel unregulated. This creates an osmotic gradient that draws water from the intravascular space into the bowel lumen (early dumping — hypovolaemia, vasomotor symptoms). The rapid glucose absorption then triggers a massive insulin spike that overshoots, causing reactive hypoglycaemia 2–3 hours later (late dumping). The treatment is logical: eat small meals, avoid simple sugars (reduce the osmotic load), and in refractory cases, use octreotide (a somatostatin analogue that inhibits GI hormone secretion and slows transit) [17].
</Callout>

##### 3. ***Nutritional Deficiencies*** [17]

These are **inevitable** long-term consequences of gastrectomy and require lifelong supplementation:

| Deficiency | Mechanism | Clinical Consequence | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Vitamin B12 deficiency*** | ***↓ Gastric acid + ↓ intrinsic factor*** — parietal cells (which produce intrinsic factor needed for B12 absorption in the terminal ileum) are removed with the stomach [17] | Megaloblastic anaemia (macrocytic), subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, peripheral neuropathy, glossitis | ***IM B12 every 3 months*** (lifelong) [17] — oral B12 is insufficient because intrinsic factor is absent |
| ***Iron deficiency*** | ***↓ Gastric acid required to cleave iron from food*** (acid converts Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺, the absorbable form) + bypass of duodenum (primary site of iron absorption) [17] | Microcytic hypochromic anaemia, koilonychia, glossitis | Oral iron supplementation (take with vitamin C to enhance absorption); IV iron if oral is insufficient |
| ***Calcium deficiency*** | ***↓ Gastric acid → impaired calcium solubilisation and absorption*** + loss of duodenal continuity (calcium absorbed in duodenum) [17] | ***Osteoporosis***, pathological fractures, tetany (if severe hypocalcaemia) | Calcium + vitamin D supplementation; DEXA scanning for osteoporosis monitoring |
| ***Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, K)*** | ***Loss of duodenal continuity*** → bile and pancreatic enzymes mix with food further downstream → impaired fat digestion → impaired fat-soluble vitamin absorption [17] | Vitamin D: osteomalacia; Vitamin K: coagulopathy; Vitamin A: night blindness; Vitamin E: neurological dysfunction | Fat-soluble vitamin supplementation |
| ***Steatorrhoea*** | Pancreaticobiliary-food asynchrony (food reaches the jejunum before bile/pancreatic juice can mix with it); bacterial overgrowth in blind loops (afferent limb) [17] | Fatty, foul-smelling, floating stools; weight loss; fat-soluble vitamin deficiency | Pancreatic enzyme supplementation; antibiotics for bacterial overgrowth |

##### 4. ***Recurrence*** [17]

- ***Usually at the gastric bed*** [17] — the site of the original tumour
- Can also recur at the anastomosis, peritoneum, liver, or distant sites
- Monitored by:
  - Regular clinical follow-up (symptoms, examination)
  - Serial tumour markers (CEA, CA19-9) — a rising level after initial post-operative normalisation is suspicious
  - Surveillance CT scans
  - Endoscopic surveillance of the anastomosis

### III. Complications of Chemotherapy / Chemoradiation

| Complication | Mechanism | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Myelosuppression** (neutropaenia, thrombocytopaenia, anaemia) | Cytotoxic drugs kill rapidly dividing cells, including bone marrow haematopoietic progenitors | Increased infection risk (neutropaenic sepsis), bleeding risk, fatigue; manage with G-CSF, transfusions |
| **Nausea / Vomiting** | Chemotherapy triggers the chemoreceptor trigger zone (area postrema) and damages GI mucosa | Anti-emetics: 5-HT₃ antagonists (ondansetron), NK1 antagonists (aprepitant), dexamethasone |
| **Mucositis / Stomatitis** | Damage to rapidly dividing mucosal epithelial cells | Oral care, analgesic mouthwashes |
| **Peripheral neuropathy** | Oxaliplatin (component of FLOT/Xelox) causes dorsal root ganglion neurotoxicity | Dose-limiting; may be irreversible; cold-induced dysaesthesia is characteristic of oxaliplatin |
| **Cardiotoxicity** | 5-FU can cause coronary vasospasm; trastuzumab can reduce LV ejection fraction | Cardiac monitoring (ECG, echocardiography) |
| **Diarrhoea** | GI mucosal damage; 5-FU and irinotecan are particularly associated | Loperamide; IV fluids if severe |
| **Hand-foot syndrome** | Capecitabine (oral 5-FU prodrug) concentrates in palms/soles → painful erythema, desquamation | Dose reduction; emollients; pyridoxine (vitamin B6) |
| **Radiation-induced complications** | Radiation to the gastric bed damages adjacent structures (liver, kidneys, small bowel, spinal cord) | Radiation enteritis, nephrotoxicity; strict field planning to minimise collateral damage |

---

### IV. Prognosis

***Prognostic indicators*** [19]:
- ***Depth of invasion (T stage)*** — the single most important prognostic factor [2]
- ***Lymph node involvement (N stage)***
- ***Degree of differentiation*** — poorly differentiated tumours have worse outcomes
- Additional factors: Lauren type (diffuse worse than intestinal), resection margin status (R0 vs R1/R2), lymphovascular invasion, molecular subtype (MSI-H better prognosis)

| Stage | Approximate 5-Year Survival |
|:---|:---|
| Stage IA (T1N0) | > 90% |
| Stage IB–IIA | 60–80% |
| Stage IIB–IIIA | 35–60% |
| Stage IIIB–IIIC | 15–30% |
| Stage IV (M1) | < 5% |
