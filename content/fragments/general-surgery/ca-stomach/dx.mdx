## Diagnosis of CA Stomach — Diagnostic Criteria, Algorithm and Investigations

### I. Diagnostic Principles

There is no single "diagnostic criterion" for gastric cancer in the way that rheumatological or metabolic diseases have point-based criteria. Instead, the diagnosis rests on a **histopathological confirmation** from tissue obtained at endoscopy. The clinical workflow is:

1. **Suspicion** → clinical features + alarm symptoms
2. **Tissue diagnosis** → OGD + biopsy (the gold standard)
3. **Staging** → determine extent of disease to guide management
4. **Pre-operative assessment** → fitness for surgery

***It is notoriously difficult to make an early diagnosis*** — the clinical presentations of ***benign gastric ulcer, early gastric cancer, and advanced gastric cancer*** overlap substantially [5]. This means a low threshold for endoscopy in at-risk patients is essential.

### II. Diagnostic Algorithm

The following algorithm integrates clinical suspicion, tissue diagnosis, and staging into a single workflow:

### III. Investigation Modalities — Detailed Breakdown

#### A. Blood Tests (Baseline / Pre-operative)

***CBP, LFT, RFT*** are the mandatory baseline investigations [5][16].

| Test | What You're Looking For | Rationale / Interpretation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***CBC with differentials*** | **Hypochromic microcytic anaemia** (low MCV, low MCH, low ferritin, low iron, high TIBC) | Iron deficiency anaemia from chronic occult GI blood loss — tumour ulceration erodes mucosal vessels. This may be the only clue in early/submucosal tumours [16][3] |
| ***LFT*** | **Raised ALP, GGT** (cholestatic pattern); **hypoalbuminaemia** | ALP/GGT rise suggests liver metastases or biliary obstruction from porta hepatis lymphadenopathy. Albumin is a marker of nutritional status — often low in advanced cancer with cachexia [3][16] |
| ***RFT*** | **Raised creatinine, proteinuria** | Evaluate for ***membranous nephropathy (nephrotic syndrome)*** — a recognised ***paraneoplastic syndrome*** of gastric adenocarcinoma [3][5]. Also baseline for chemotherapy dosing and contrast administration |
| ***Clotting profile*** | **Prolonged PT/INR** | Liver synthetic function assessment (if metastatic liver disease); also baseline for surgery. Disseminated intravascular coagulation can occur in advanced malignancy (Trousseau's) |
| ***Electrolyte profile*** | **Hypochloraemic hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis** | Occurs secondary to GOO with ***repeated vomiting of HCl*** → loss of H⁺ and Cl⁻ → metabolic alkalosis; renal compensation leads to K⁺ wasting (secondary hyperaldosteronism from volume depletion) [3][12] |
| Iron studies | Low ferritin, low serum iron, high TIBC | Confirms iron deficiency as the cause of anaemia |
| Group and save / Crossmatch | Blood type; antibody screen | Pre-operative preparation; anticipate blood loss |

#### B. Tumour Markers

***CEA, CA19-9, CA125*** [3][16]

<Callout title="Tumour Markers Are NOT Diagnostic" type="error">
This is a common exam pitfall. ***CEA and CA125 are NOT useful in diagnosis*** [3]. They lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for screening or primary diagnosis. They **are** useful for:
- **Baseline measurement** pre-operatively
- **Monitoring response to chemotherapy** — a falling level suggests treatment response
- **Detecting recurrence post-surgery** — a rising level after initial normalisation suggests recurrence [2][3]

***CEA, CA19-9 are for follow-up*** [5][16].
</Callout>

| Marker | Notes |
|:---|:---|
| **CEA** (carcinoembryonic antigen) | Epithelial marker; elevated in many GI malignancies, smoking, IBD, pregnancy — very non-specific. Elevated in ~30-40% of gastric cancers |
| **CA19-9** | Also elevated in pancreatic, biliary, and colorectal cancers; and in benign biliary obstruction, pancreatitis |
| **CA125** | More commonly associated with ovarian cancer; can be elevated in peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer |
| **CA72-4** | Most specific tumour marker for gastric cancer (though still not widely used for screening); may be used in combination |

---

#### C. Upper Endoscopy (OGD) + Biopsy — THE GOLD STANDARD

***Upper endoscopy and biopsies*** [5][16] — this is the single most important investigation. It serves two purposes:
1. **Obtain tissue diagnosis** (histological confirmation of malignancy)
2. **Evaluate extent of primary tumour** endoscopically [2]

**Why OGD is the gold standard:**
- Direct visualisation of the gastric mucosa with magnification
- Ability to take **multiple targeted biopsies** from suspicious lesions
- Assessment of tumour location, size, morphology (Borrmann type), and involvement of the GOJ
- Therapeutic potential (e.g., endoscopic mucosal resection for early gastric cancer)

**Endoscopic findings in gastric cancer:**

| Finding | Type of Cancer | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Ulcerated mass protruding into lumen | Advanced (Borrmann I/II) | Irregular, raised edges; friable tissue; necrotic base — contrasts with benign ulcers that have smooth, regular, rounded edges and a flat base [4] |
| Irregular/thickened ulcer margins | Advanced (Borrmann III) | Ulcer with poorly defined, heaped-up margins; folds surrounding the crater are ***nodular, clubbed, fused*** [4] |
| ***Rigid stomach that could not be distended with air; mucosa may appear "normal"*** | ***Linitis plastica (Borrmann IV)*** [5] | The stomach fails to inflate properly on insufflation. The mucosa looks deceptively normal because the tumour infiltrates the submucosa/muscularis propria. This is the classic trap — standard superficial biopsies will miss it |
| Subtle mucosal irregularity, discolouration, depression | Early gastric cancer | Small, flat or depressed lesions; may require chromoendoscopy or narrow-band imaging (NBI) to detect |

**Biopsy technique:**
- **At least 6–8 biopsies** should be taken from the margin of any gastric ulcer (multiple quadrants) to maximise diagnostic sensitivity — a single biopsy has only ~70% sensitivity, but 7 biopsies reaches > 98%
- For suspected ***linitis plastica***: use ***deep "strip and bite" biopsy technique*** — standard mucosal biopsies are insufficient because the tumour is submucosal [3]
- Biopsies of **normal-appearing mucosa** in the antrum and body should also be taken to assess for *H. pylori*, atrophic gastritis, and intestinal metaplasia (the Sydney protocol: 5 biopsies — 2 antrum, 1 incisura, 2 body)

**Advanced endoscopic techniques:**
- **Narrow-band imaging (NBI):** Uses specific wavelengths of light to enhance surface mucosal and vascular patterns — helps distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions without dye application
- **Chromoendoscopy:** Application of dyes (e.g., indigo carmine, methylene blue) to enhance mucosal detail — useful for detecting early gastric cancer and defining margins for endoscopic resection
- **Magnification endoscopy:** Allows detailed assessment of mucosal pit patterns and microvascular architecture

**Histological analysis from biopsy should determine:**
- Histological type (adenocarcinoma vs lymphoma vs GIST vs other)
- Lauren classification (intestinal vs diffuse)
- Grade of differentiation (well / moderately / poorly differentiated)
- ***HER2 status*** (by IHC ± FISH) — essential for treatment decisions (trastuzumab eligibility; ***HER2 +ve in ~15% of intestinal type***) [2]
- Microsatellite instability (MSI) / mismatch repair (MMR) status — for immunotherapy eligibility
- PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) — for checkpoint inhibitor eligibility
- EBV status (EBER ISH)

<Callout title="Key Molecular Markers to Request on Biopsy (2025 Standard of Care)">
For all newly diagnosed gastric/GOJ adenocarcinomas, request:
1. **HER2** (IHC ± FISH) — if positive → trastuzumab
2. **MSI/MMR status** — if MSI-H/dMMR → checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab/nivolumab)
3. **PD-L1 CPS** — if CPS ≥ 5 → nivolumab in first-line setting
4. **Claudin 18.2** (CLDN18.2) — if positive → zolbetuximab (new targeted therapy)

These molecular tests fundamentally change the treatment algorithm and should never be forgotten.
</Callout>

**Alternative to OGD — Barium Swallow/Meal:**
- ***Limited diagnostic value except for linitis plastica*** [2]
- Shows a non-distensible "leather bottle" stomach with loss of mucosal folds — the classic radiographic appearance
- Cannot take biopsies — so even if barium is suggestive, OGD is still needed
- Largely superseded by OGD in modern practice but still useful when OGD cannot adequately assess gastric distensibility

---

#### D. Staging Investigations

Once histological diagnosis is confirmed, staging determines the extent of disease and guides treatment decisions. ***The most important prognostic factor is depth of tumour invasion*** [2].

The staging workup is best understood by what each modality assesses:

| Investigation | Best For | Limitations |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***CT abdomen + pelvis ± thorax with contrast*** | ***M staging (mandatory)***; locoregional extension | ***Not accurate for T & N staging*** [2] |
| ***Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)*** | ***T staging and N staging*** (most accurate) | ***NOT mandatory for CA stomach*** — upfront surgery advocated in most cases [2]; operator-dependent; more invasive |
| ***Staging laparoscopy + peritoneal lavage*** | ***Peritoneal and liver metastasis*** (more accurate than CT) | Invasive (requires GA); does not assess distant nodal/haematogenous metastases |
| ***PET-CT*** | Distant metastasis; treatment response monitoring | ***Not too sensitive for CA stomach*** (especially mucinous/signet ring tumours — low FDG avidity) [2] |
| ***CXR*** | Lung metastases; pleural effusion; pre-op | Low sensitivity for small pulmonary metastases |

##### 1. ***CT Thorax + Abdomen + Pelvis with IV Contrast*** [5][16]

***Mandatory for M staging*** but ***not accurate for T & N*** [2].

- **Why CT?** It provides a rapid, non-invasive survey of the entire torso to detect:
  - **Liver metastases** — hypodense lesions in the liver parenchyma (the most common distant metastatic site)
  - **Peritoneal nodules / ascites** — though CT has limited sensitivity for small peritoneal deposits (hence the need for staging laparoscopy)
  - **Lymphadenopathy** — enlarged lymph nodes along coeliac axis, para-aortic region, mediastinum (Virchow's)
  - **Direct invasion** into adjacent organs (pancreas, transverse colon, spleen)
  - **Hydronephrosis** — from ureteric obstruction by pelvic or retroperitoneal tumour deposits
  - **Lung metastases, pleural effusion** — especially if proximal (cardia) tumour
- ***Thorax CT is included if proximal tumour (e.g., cardia/GOJ)*** — to assess mediastinal involvement [2]
- CT is also the basis for assessing **resectability** — e.g., major vessel encasement, distant metastatic disease

**CT appearances of gastric cancer:**
- Focal or diffuse gastric wall thickening (> 5mm when distended)
- Enhancing intraluminal mass
- Loss of fat planes with adjacent organs (suggesting T4b invasion)
- ***In linitis plastica: diffuse circumferential wall thickening with loss of rugal folds***

##### 2. ***Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)*** [2][5][16]

- ***More sensitive in T staging (e.g., differentiating T4a vs T4b) and N staging (e.g., perigastric LN)*** [2]
- ***More operator-dependent and more invasive compared to CT*** [2]
- ***NOT mandatory for CA stomach*** — unlike CA oesophagus where EUS is standard, in CA stomach ***upfront surgery is advocated*** in most situations [2]

**When IS EUS useful?**
- Suspected **early gastric cancer** (T1a vs T1b) — this distinction determines eligibility for **endoscopic resection** (T1a only, if other criteria met) vs surgery
- Assessing **depth of invasion** when CT is equivocal (e.g., T3 vs T4a — determines whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy is warranted)
- **EUS-guided FNA** of suspicious perigastric lymph nodes for cytological confirmation
- **Submucosal masses** — to determine the layer of origin and guide biopsy approach [14]

**EUS wall layers of the stomach** (from lumen outward):
1. Hyperechoic — superficial mucosa
2. Hypoechoic — deep mucosa (muscularis mucosae)
3. Hyperechoic — submucosa
4. Hypoechoic — muscularis propria
5. Hyperechoic — serosa

The tumour appears as a **hypoechoic lesion** disrupting these normal layer patterns. The key question is: *which layer does the tumour reach?*

##### 3. ***Staging Laparoscopy + Peritoneal Lavage*** [2][5][16]

***More accurate for peritoneal and liver metastasis compared to CT*** [2]. This is considered **routine** in many centres (including HK) before committing to curative-intent surgery.

**Why is it needed?**
- CT has a sensitivity of only ~30–50% for detecting peritoneal carcinomatosis — small (< 5mm) peritoneal deposits are easily missed
- **Direct visualisation** of the peritoneal surfaces, liver surface, and omentum ± **biopsy of suspicious lesions for frozen section** [2]
- ***Peritoneal washing for cytology*** — even in the absence of visible peritoneal deposits, positive peritoneal cytology indicates **microscopic peritoneal metastasis** (classified as M1) and renders the disease incurable by surgery alone [2]
- Avoids unnecessary laparotomy in patients with occult peritoneal disease — a significant benefit given the morbidity of a non-therapeutic gastrectomy

**Indications for staging laparoscopy (typically):**
- Any patient being considered for curative-intent gastrectomy with ≥T3 or node-positive disease on imaging
- Particularly important for **diffuse-type / linitis plastica** (high rate of occult peritoneal metastasis — 1/3 at diagnosis) [3]

##### 4. ***PET-CT*** [5][16]

- Uses ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) — a glucose analogue taken up preferentially by metabolically active (including malignant) cells
- ***Not too sensitive for CA stomach*** [2] — Why?
  - **Mucinous and signet ring cell adenocarcinomas** (diffuse type) have relatively low metabolic activity and therefore low FDG uptake → false negatives
  - **Normal physiological gastric uptake** can obscure the primary tumour
- **When PET-CT IS useful:**
  - Detecting **distant metastases** not seen on CT (e.g., unsuspected bone, distant nodal metastases)
  - **Monitoring treatment response** after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (metabolic response assessment)
  - Detecting **recurrence** post-surgery
- ***Alternative to CT for M staging*** but not routinely first-line for gastric cancer [2]

##### 5. ***CXR*** [5][16]

***Chest x-ray*** is a basic but essential investigation:
- Detect lung metastases (cannonball lesions)
- Pleural effusion (malignant or reactive)
- Lymphangitis carcinomatosis (reticular interstitial pattern — bilateral, often lower zones)
- Pre-operative baseline assessment of cardiopulmonary status

---

#### E. ***Value of Diagnostic Imaging*** — Summary by Clinical Scenario [5]

***Diagnostic imaging is valuable for:*** [5]
- ***Staging — chest x-ray, CAT scan, PET scan***
- ***Diagnosis of:***
  - ***Intestinal obstruction***
  - ***Malignant biliary obstruction***
  - ***Malignant ureteric obstruction***
- ***Monitoring response to treatment***

---

#### F. ***Clinical Staging Summary*** [5]

From the lecture slides, the ***clinical staging*** workup consists of:
- ***History and physical examination***
- ***Liver function test***
- ***Chest x-ray***
- ***Ultrasonography or CAT scan abdomen***
- ***PET/CT scan***
- ***Endoscopic ultrasound***
- ***Laparoscopy***

### IV. Summary Table — Investigations by Purpose

| Purpose | Investigation | Key Findings |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Tissue Diagnosis** | ***OGD + multiple biopsies*** | Histological type, Lauren classification, differentiation grade, HER2, MSI, PD-L1, CLDN18.2 |
| **Alternative for linitis plastica** | ***Barium swallow*** | Non-distensible leather bottle stomach; loss of rugal folds |
| **T and N staging** | ***EUS*** (if needed) | Depth of wall invasion (T1a vs T1b vs T2+); perigastric LN involvement |
| **M staging** | ***CT TAP with contrast*** (mandatory) | Liver mets, peritoneal nodules, LN, direct invasion, hydronephrosis |
| **Peritoneal staging** | ***Staging laparoscopy + peritoneal lavage*** | Peritoneal deposits, liver surface mets, positive peritoneal cytology |
| **Distant metastasis** | ***PET-CT*** (adjunct) | Unsuspected distant mets; treatment response |
| **Baseline / Pre-op** | ***CBC, LFT, RFT, clotting, electrolytes, CXR*** | Anaemia, liver function, renal function, nutritional status, cardiopulmonary fitness |
| **Follow-up / Monitoring** | ***CEA, CA19-9, CA125*** | Trend over time; rising level suggests recurrence |

### V. Morphological Differentiation — Benign vs Malignant Gastric Ulcer on OGD

This is a high-yield comparison for exams [4]:

| Feature | Benign Ulcer | Malignant Ulcer |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Edges** | ***Smooth, regular, rounded*** | ***Irregular, thickened, heaped-up*** |
| **Base** | ***Flat, smooth, often filled with exudate*** | Necrotic, nodular |
| **Surrounding folds** | Radiate symmetrically to the ulcer edge | ***Nodular, clubbed, fused*** — folds do not reach the edge cleanly |
| **Mucosa** | Smooth, pliable surrounding mucosa | Friable, easily bleeds on contact |
| **Shape** | Round or oval | Irregular |

<Callout title="Every Gastric Ulcer Gets Biopsied" type="error">
Even if an ulcer looks "benign" endoscopically, **always biopsy** (≥6 biopsies from the margin). A proportion of malignant ulcers can appear deceptively benign. Furthermore, every gastric ulcer must have a **repeat OGD at 6–8 weeks** post-treatment to confirm healing. A non-healing gastric ulcer despite appropriate therapy is malignant until proven otherwise [4].
</Callout>

### VI. Special Diagnostic Considerations

#### Linitis Plastica — The Diagnostic Challenge

As covered earlier, ***linitis plastica*** presents a unique diagnostic problem:
- ***Mucosa may appear "normal" on endoscopy*** [5]
- ***Rigid, could not be distended with air*** [5]
- Standard mucosal biopsies → **false negatives** because the tumour infiltrates the submucosa and muscularis propria [3]

**Diagnostic approach:**
1. **Deep strip-and-bite biopsies** (grab deeper tissue including submucosa)
2. **EUS** — shows diffuse hypoechoic wall thickening involving the 3rd and 4th layers (submucosa and muscularis propria)
3. ***Barium swallow*** — may be superior to OGD for this specific entity; shows the classic non-distensible stomach with narrowed lumen and loss of rugal folds [2]
4. **CT** — shows diffuse circumferential gastric wall thickening

#### HER2 Testing — Why It Matters

- HER2 (Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor; when amplified/overexpressed, it drives uncontrolled cell proliferation
- ***HER2 +ve in ~15% of gastric cancers*** (predominantly intestinal type) [2]
- Testing method: **IHC first** → if 2+ (equivocal) → confirm with **FISH** (fluorescence in situ hybridisation)
- A positive HER2 result qualifies the patient for **trastuzumab** (Herceptin) — a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2 — in combination with chemotherapy

---

> **High Yield Summary — Diagnosis of CA Stomach:**
>
> - **Gold standard:** OGD + multiple biopsies (≥6 from ulcer margins). Request histology + HER2 + MSI/MMR + PD-L1 + CLDN18.2 on all new diagnoses.
> - **Tumour markers (CEA, CA19-9, CA125) are NOT diagnostic** — used for follow-up and monitoring recurrence only.
> - **Staging workup:** CT TAP with contrast (mandatory for M staging, not accurate for T/N); EUS (best for T/N but NOT mandatory — upfront surgery advocated); Staging laparoscopy + peritoneal lavage (routine — more accurate than CT for peritoneal disease); PET-CT (adjunct, not sensitive for mucinous/signet ring tumours).
> - **Linitis plastica** is the diagnostic trap: normal-appearing mucosa on OGD, non-distensible stomach, requires deep biopsies + EUS + barium swallow.
> - **Benign vs malignant ulcer:** benign = smooth, regular, rounded edges, flat base; malignant = irregular, thickened edges, nodular/clubbed/fused surrounding folds. ALL gastric ulcers must be biopsied and followed up.
> - **Clinical staging checklist** (from lecture): H&P, LFT, CXR, USG/CT abdomen, PET/CT, EUS, laparoscopy.
