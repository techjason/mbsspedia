## Differential Diagnosis of CA Stomach

The differential diagnosis of gastric cancer is fundamentally about **pattern recognition** — you are presented with a patient who has some combination of dyspepsia, weight loss, vomiting, GI bleeding, anaemia, an epigastric mass, or dysphagia. The key question is: *what else could produce this clinical picture?*

The approach depends on the **dominant presenting feature**. Let me walk you through this systematically.

---

### Why is the Differential Diagnosis Broad?

***Gastric cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose early*** [5]. The symptoms — epigastric discomfort, bloating, early satiety, nausea — are **identical to benign conditions** like functional dyspepsia and peptic ulcer disease, which are vastly more common. This is why alarm features (red flags) exist: they are the clinical "tripwires" that should shift your thinking from benign to potentially malignant.

***The clinical presentation of benign gastric ulcer, early gastric cancer, and advanced gastric cancer can overlap significantly*** [5]. An OGD with biopsy is the only way to reliably distinguish them.

### A. Differential Diagnosis by Presenting Syndrome

#### 1. Dyspepsia / Epigastric Pain

This is the **most common presentation** of gastric cancer, but dyspepsia affects ~25% of the population and is overwhelmingly benign [8].

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Mimics CA Stomach |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Functional dyspepsia (60% of dyspepsia)*** | No structural cause on OGD; Rome IV criteria; symptoms > 6 months; no alarm features | Shares epigastric pain, early satiety, bloating, nausea [8] |
| ***Peptic ulcer disease (gastric/duodenal)*** | Epigastric pain related to meals; GU: precipitated by food; DU: relieved by food, worse at night; *H. pylori* or NSAID history | Epigastric pain, GI bleeding, weight loss (from food avoidance); **gastric ulcers must ALWAYS be biopsied to exclude malignancy** [4][8] |
| ***Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD)*** | Retrosternal burning (heartburn), regurgitation, worse on lying flat/bending; responds to PPI | Can cause epigastric discomfort; proximal gastric/cardia cancer may cause reflux-like symptoms [8] |
| ***Chronic pancreatitis*** | Epigastric pain radiating to the back; steatorrhoea; history of alcohol/recurrent pancreatitis; pancreatic calcifications on imaging | Epigastric pain, weight loss, anorexia [8] |
| ***Pancreatic cancer*** | ***Painless progressive obstructive jaundice*** (head); ***severe epigastric pain radiating to the back*** (body/tail); new-onset DM; weight loss [9][10] | Weight loss, epigastric mass, anorexia; may present identically to CA stomach — requires imaging (CT) to differentiate |
| ***Gastritis / Duodenitis*** | Often drug-induced (NSAIDs, alcohol) or stress-related; typically self-limited; diagnosed on OGD | Epigastric pain, nausea, GI bleeding [8] |
| ***Biliary colic / Cholecystitis*** | RUQ/epigastric pain, colicky, post-prandial (fatty food), Murphy's sign; USS shows gallstones | Epigastric pain post-prandially; referred epigastric pain |

<Callout title="The Golden Rule for Gastric Ulcers" type="error">
Every gastric ulcer found on OGD must be biopsied (multiple biopsies from the ulcer margin) AND followed up with a repeat OGD at 6–8 weeks to confirm healing. Unlike duodenal ulcers (which virtually never become malignant), **gastric ulcers can harbour carcinoma**, and a malignant ulcer can look macroscopically identical to a benign one [4][8].
</Callout>

#### 2. Upper GI Bleeding (Haematemesis / Melaena / Iron Deficiency Anaemia)

Gastric cancer accounts for a **small proportion** of UGIB — peptic ulcer disease is by far the most common cause [8][11].

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Features |
|:---|:---|
| ***Peptic ulcer disease*** (most common cause of UGIB) | 4 major risk factors: *H. pylori*, NSAIDs, stress, excess acid; episodic bleeding; visible vessel/clot on OGD [8][11] |
| ***Oesophagogastric varices*** | History of liver cirrhosis / portal hypertension; massive haematemesis; stigmata of chronic liver disease [8] |
| ***Erosive oesophagitis / oesophageal ulcers*** | GERD history; medications (bisphosphonates, tetracyclines); infections (HSV, Candida) [8] |
| ***Gastritis / Duodenitis*** | Drug/alcohol/stress-related; typically self-limited; mucosal inflammation on OGD [8] |
| ***Portal hypertensive gastropathy*** | Cirrhotic patients; friable mucosa with "snakeskin" or "mosaic" pattern on OGD; more commonly occult bleeding [8] |
| ***Mallory-Weiss syndrome*** | Longitudinal mucosal tear at GOJ preceded by forceful retching/vomiting; typically self-limited [8] |
| ***Dieulafoy's lesion*** | Dilated aberrant submucosal artery eroding overlying epithelium without primary ulcer; usually proximal stomach along lesser curvature; intermittent arterial spurting [8] |
| ***Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE)*** | "Watermelon stomach" — longitudinal reddish stripes radiating from pylorus; associated with cirrhosis, autoimmune disease [8] |
| ***Angiodysplasia*** | Dilated tortuous submucosal vessels; more common in elderly; associated with aortic stenosis (Heyde's syndrome) [8] |
| ***Other upper GI malignancy*** | Oesophageal cancer, duodenal cancer — uncommon causes of UGIB; constitutional symptoms more prominent [8] |

#### 3. Vomiting / Gastric Outlet Obstruction (GOO)

***GOO is malignant until proven otherwise*** — **80% malignant, 20% benign** [2][12].

| Differential | Key Features |
|:---|:---|
| **Malignant (80%)** | |
| ***Gastric cancer (most common cause of GOO)*** | Progressive, non-bilious vomiting of undigested food; weight loss; epigastric mass [2][12] |
| ***Gastric lymphoma*** | Similar presentation; may have B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) [2] |
| ***Extrinsic compression: CA head of pancreas, CA ampulla of Vater, transverse colon/hepatic flexure, locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma/CA gallbladder*** | Jaundice may be prominent; distinct imaging findings [12] |
| **Benign (20%)** | |
| ***PUD-related pyloric stenosis (2nd most common cause)*** | Long history of PUD; chronic fibrotic scarring at pylorus [12] |
| ***Gastric volvulus*** | Acute presentation; associated with paraesophageal (rolling) hiatal hernia; Borchardt's triad (epigastric pain, retching, inability to pass NG tube) [12] |
| ***Foreign body / Bezoar / Bouveret syndrome*** | Bouveret = gallstone impaction in duodenum (gallstone ileus variant) [12] |
| ***SMA syndrome*** | Thin young patients; duodenal compression between SMA and aorta [12] |
| ***Chronic pancreatitis*** | Inflammatory exudate compressing duodenum [12] |
| ***Crohn's disease, Gastric TB*** | Chronic inflammatory stricturing [12] |

#### 4. Dysphagia (Proximal / Cardia Tumour)

When gastric cancer involves the **cardia or GOJ**, the presentation overlaps with oesophageal cancer [6].

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Features |
|:---|:---|
| ***Oesophageal carcinoma (SCC or adenocarcinoma)*** | Progressive dysphagia (solids → liquids); weight loss; SCC: mid-oesophagus, smoking/alcohol; adenocarcinoma: distal oesophagus/GOJ, Barrett's [6] |
| ***Achalasia*** | Dysphagia to both solids AND liquids from onset; regurgitation of undigested food; bird's beak on barium swallow; diagnosed by high-resolution manometry [13] |
| ***Pseudoachalasia*** | Mimics achalasia but caused by ***CA cardia invading the oesophageal neural plexus*** (paraneoplastic); differentiate by OGD + EUS — look for mass [13] |
| ***Oesophageal stricture (peptic)*** | History of longstanding GERD; smooth, tapered narrowing on barium/OGD |
| ***Extrinsic compression*** | Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, lung cancer, aortic aneurysm |

<Callout title="Pseudoachalasia — A Dangerous Mimic" type="error">
***Pseudoachalasia*** can be caused by malignancy at the GOJ/cardia invading the oesophageal neural plexus directly, or as a paraneoplastic syndrome [13]. Clues that suggest pseudoachalasia over true achalasia: **age > 60**, **rapid onset of dysphagia ( < 6 months)**, **significant weight loss**, and **difficulty passing the endoscope through the GOJ**. Always perform OGD (± EUS) before diagnosing achalasia to exclude malignancy [13].
</Callout>

#### 5. Epigastric Mass

An epigastric mass narrows the differential considerably, but you still need to consider non-gastric causes [5][14].

| Differential | Key Features |
|:---|:---|
| ***Gastric adenocarcinoma*** | Firm, irregular epigastric mass; associated with weight loss, anaemia, GI bleed [5] |
| ***Gastric lymphoma*** | May be indistinguishable from adenocarcinoma on examination; typically younger; B symptoms; OGD + biopsy with IHC needed [2] |
| ***GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumour)*** | ***50% in stomach (most common proximal stomach); usually incidental finding; mass with smooth margins and normal overlying mucosa on OGD; arises from muscularis propria (interstitial cells of Cajal); diagnosed by EUS + FNA; IHC: CD117 (c-KIT) positive*** [14] |
| ***Pancreatic cancer / pseudocyst*** | Mass may be palpable in the epigastrium; associated with jaundice (head), back pain (body/tail), weight loss [9][10] |
| ***Hepatomegaly (metastatic liver)*** | Hard, nodular, irregular liver edge extending into epigastrium; ***commonest site of metastasis from GI tract via portal venous circulation*** [15] |
| ***Omental cake*** | Hard, irregular mass across upper abdomen; peritoneal carcinomatosis (often from gastric, ovarian, or colonic primary) [2] |
| ***Gastric volvulus*** | Acute or chronic; tympanitic epigastric distension |

### B. Differential Diagnosis of Gastric Mass by Wall Layer

This is a useful conceptual framework (especially relevant for EUS assessment) [14]:

| Layer | Differential |
|:---|:---|
| **Mucosa** | ***Adenocarcinoma***, gastrinoma, carcinoid, adenoma |
| **Submucosa** | ***Neuroendocrine tumour (NET)***, ***lymphoma***, lipoma, ectopic pancreas |
| **Muscularis propria** | ***GIST*** (most common), leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, schwannoma, desmoid tumour |
| **Serosa/Adventitia** | Extrinsic compression (pancreas, spleen, lymph nodes) |

### D. Key Differentiating Points — Gastric Cancer vs Its Major Mimics

| Feature | CA Stomach | Peptic Ulcer Disease | Gastric Lymphoma | GIST |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Age** | Older (intestinal) or younger (diffuse) | Any age | 50–60s | 50–70s |
| **Symptoms** | Progressive, alarm features | Episodic, meal-related | B symptoms possible | Often incidental |
| **OGD appearance** | Irregular ulcer, mass, rigid wall | Clean-based or cratered ulcer, smooth margins | Thickened folds, mass, ulceration | Smooth submucosal bulge, intact mucosa |
| **Biopsy** | Adenocarcinoma | Inflammatory, no dysplasia | Lymphoid tissue; IHC for B-cell markers | ***Spindle cells; CD117+, c-KIT mutation*** [14] |
| **Key investigation** | OGD + biopsy | OGD + biopsy + CLO test | OGD + deep biopsy + IHC | ***EUS + FNA*** [14] |

<Callout title="Gastric Lymphoma vs Adenocarcinoma" type="idea">
Gastric lymphoma (usually MALT lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) can present identically to adenocarcinoma on OGD. Key differences: lymphoma may show **thickened gastric folds** rather than a discrete mass, and it often responds to *H. pylori* eradication (early-stage MALT). **Deep biopsies with immunohistochemistry** (CD20, CD79a for B-cell markers) are essential — superficial biopsies may miss the lymphoid infiltrate in the lamina propria/submucosa [2][14].
</Callout>

### E. Do Not Forget Non-GI Causes

When a patient presents with "epigastric pain + weight loss," think beyond the stomach:

- ***Pancreatic cancer*** — weight loss, back pain, jaundice; CT shows pancreatic mass [9][10]
- **Hepatocellular carcinoma** — risk factors (chronic hepatitis B/C, cirrhosis); AFP elevated; USS/CT shows liver mass
- ***Metastatic carcinoma to the liver*** — ***commoner than primary liver cancer; commonest site from GI tract via portal venous circulation (colorectal, stomach, pancreas)***; hepatomegaly ± symptoms from primary [15]
- **Chronic mesenteric ischaemia** — "intestinal angina"; post-prandial pain → food fear → weight loss; elderly with vascular risk factors
- **Coeliac disease** — weight loss, diarrhoea, iron deficiency anaemia; anti-tTG antibodies
- **Metabolic causes of dyspepsia** — hypercalcaemia, hyperkalaemia [8]

> - **GOO is malignant until proven otherwise.**
> - **Pseudoachalasia** (malignancy mimicking achalasia) must be excluded by OGD ± EUS before diagnosing achalasia.
> - For submucosal gastric masses: think **GIST** (CD117+, muscularis propria), **lymphoma** (submucosa), **NET** — require EUS ± FNA.
