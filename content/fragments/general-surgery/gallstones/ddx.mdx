## Differential Diagnosis of Gallstones

The differential diagnosis of gallstones must be approached systematically because gallstones themselves present in many different ways — and at each presentation (RUQ pain, jaundice, cholangitis, pancreatitis), there is a different differential list. The key clinical skill is to determine (1) **is this gallstone-related or not?** and (2) **if gallstone-related, which specific gallstone complication is it?**

Think of the differential as concentric circles: first, distinguish among the various gallstone presentations themselves (biliary colic vs. cholecystitis vs. choledocholithiasis vs. cholangitis vs. pancreatitis), and second, distinguish gallstone disease from non-gallstone conditions that mimic it.

---

### 1. The Clinical Problem: Where Does the Stone Sit?

Before considering non-gallstone diagnoses, you must first differentiate *within* the gallstone spectrum, because the management is radically different:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Patient with suspected gallstone disease"] --> B{"Where is the stone?"}
    B --> C["Gallbladder only<br/>Biliary colic / Cholecystitis"]
    B --> D["CBD<br/>Choledocholithiasis"]
    B --> E["Ampulla of Vater<br/>Gallstone pancreatitis"]
    B --> F["Hartmann's pouch compressing CHD<br/>Mirizzi syndrome"]
    B --> G["Eroded into bowel<br/>Gallstone ileus"]
    C --> C1["Pain < 6h, no fever → Biliary colic"]
    C --> C2["Pain > 6h, fever, Murphy's sign → Acute cholecystitis"]
    D --> D1["Jaundice, cholestatic LFT → Uncomplicated"]
    D --> D2["+ Fever, rigors → Acute cholangitis"]
    E --> E1["Epigastric pain radiating to back, ↑amylase/lipase"]
    F --> F1["Jaundice + palpable GB, upstream dilatation"]
    G --> G1["SBO + pneumobilia + ectopic stone"]
```

The key differentiating features among gallstone presentations themselves were covered in detail in the Clinical Features section. The summary table below is useful for rapid ward-round differentiation [1][2]:

| Feature | Biliary Colic | Acute Cholecystitis | Choledocholithiasis | Acute Cholangitis | Gallstone Pancreatitis |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pain duration** | < 6h | ***> 6h*** | > 6h | Variable | Hours–days |
| **Fever** | No | Yes | ± | ***Yes (with rigors)*** | Yes (chemical) |
| **Jaundice** | No | Usually No | ***Yes*** | ***Yes*** | ± |
| **Murphy's sign** | No | ***Yes*** | No | No | No |
| **Labs** | Normal | ↑WBC, CRP | ***Cholestatic LFT*** | ↑WBC + ***cholestatic LFT*** | ***↑ Amylase/lipase*** ≥ 3× ULN |
| **Key imaging** | USG: stone + shadow | ***USG: 5 cardinal signs*** | ***USG: dilated CBD*** | USG: dilated CBD | CT (if severe) |

---

### 2. Differential Diagnosis by Presenting Complaint

The DDx changes depending on how the patient walks in. Let's go through each major presentation.

#### 2.1 DDx of RUQ Pain (Biliary Colic / Acute Cholecystitis Presentation)

This is the most common exam scenario: a patient with RUQ pain after a fatty meal. The differential is broad because many structures occupy or refer pain to the RUQ.

| Category | Condition | How to Differentiate from Gallstones |
|---|---|---|
| **Biliary** | ***Gallbladder polyps*** (adenoma, cholesterolosis, adenomyomatosis) | USG: polyps are ***not gravity-dependent and have no posterior acoustic shadow*** (unlike stones which are gravity-dependent with shadowing) [1][2][5] |
| | ***Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction*** | Pain < 6h, intermittent; ***normal laboratory and radiological tests***; diagnosed by manometry [1] |
| | ***Functional gallbladder disorder*** | Pain < 6h, intermittent; ***normal laboratory and radiological tests***; diagnosed by HIDA with CCK-stimulated ejection fraction < 35% [1] |
| **Hepatic** | ***Acute hepatitis*** (viral, alcoholic, drug-induced) | Markedly ↑ AST/ALT (hepatocellular pattern, NOT cholestatic); history of viral exposure, alcohol, drugs; USG: no stones, may show hepatomegaly |
| | ***Liver abscess*** (pyogenic or amoebic) | Swinging fever, tender hepatomegaly; USG/CT: hypoechoic/hypodense lesion in liver parenchyma; travel history (amoebic) [1] |
| | ***Hepatocellular carcinoma*** | Chronic liver disease background; AFP elevated; CT: arterial enhancement with portal venous washout |
| **Gastroduodenal** | ***Peptic ulcer disease*** (gastric/duodenal ulcer) | Epigastric burning, meal-related (DU relieved by food, GU worsened); OGD diagnostic; perforation → pneumoperitoneum on erect CXR [1] |
| **Pancreatic** | ***Acute pancreatitis*** | Epigastric pain ***radiating to the back***, improves leaning forward; ***↑ amylase/lipase ≥ 3× ULN***; gallstones may be the cause (gallstone pancreatitis is both a complication of gallstones AND a differential for RUQ pain) [1] |
| **Intestinal** | ***Acute appendicitis*** (retrocaecal/high appendix) | Pain typically starts periumbilical then migrates to RIF; McBurney's point tenderness; CT: inflamed appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding [1] |
| **Pulmonary/Cardiac** | ***Right lower lobe pneumonia*** | Cough, sputum, pleuritic chest pain referred to RUQ; CXR: consolidation in RLL [1] |
| | ***Pleurisy*** | Pleuritic pain, friction rub; CXR may show effusion |
| | ***Myocardial infarction*** (inferior MI) | Epigastric pain, diaphoresis, nausea; ECG: ST changes in II, III, aVF; troponin elevated [1] |
| **Renal** | ***Right renal colic*** | Loin-to-groin pain, haematuria; CT KUB: ureteric stone; differentiated from gallstone on ***lateral AXR view*** (renal stone is posterior, gallstone is anterior) [2] |
| **Musculoskeletal** | ***Costochondritis / intercostal pathology*** | Reproducible with palpation of chest wall; no peritoneal signs |

<Callout title="The Dangerous Mimics" type="error">
Two conditions that mimic biliary colic but carry life-threatening consequences if missed:
1. ***Inferior myocardial infarction*** — can present as pure epigastric/RUQ pain with nausea and vomiting, especially in elderly/diabetic patients. Always do an ***ECG*** in anyone with upper abdominal pain.
2. ***Right lower lobe pneumonia*** — diaphragmatic irritation refers pain to the RUQ. Always get an ***erect CXR*** in any patient with RUQ pain and fever [1].
</Callout>

#### 2.2 DDx of Obstructive Jaundice (Choledocholithiasis Presentation)

When a patient presents with jaundice + cholestatic LFT, you must differentiate stone from tumour because the management diverges completely. The lecture slides emphasise: ***"Painless progressive obstructive jaundice in the elderly is malignant biliary obstruction until proven otherwise"*** [3][5].

The differential of obstructive jaundice is classically organised by the **anatomical relationship to the bile duct wall** [3]:

| Location | Cause | Key Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Intraluminal*** | ***Choledocholithiasis*** | Intermittent/fluctuating jaundice, colicky pain, history of gallstones; USG: stone in CBD |
| | ***RPC (Recurrent Pyogenic Cholangitis)*** | SE Asian patient, recurrent cholangitis episodes, intrahepatic ductal dilatation with stones, ***left lobe predominance*** [1][2] |
| ***Mural (wall of duct)*** | ***Cholangiocarcinoma*** | ***Painless progressive jaundice***; perihilar (Klatskin) → early jaundice; CA19-9 ↑; MRCP: stricture without stone [3][5] |
| | ***Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)*** | Young male with IBD (especially UC); multifocal strictures + dilatation ("beading" on MRCP); ↑ ALP; p-ANCA +ve [1] |
| ***Extramural (extrinsic compression)*** | ***CA head of pancreas*** | ***Painless progressive obstructive jaundice***; ***palpable gallbladder (Courvoisier's sign)***; ***double duct sign*** on CT (dilated CBD + pancreatic duct); weight loss; new-onset DM [5][6] |
| | ***Periampullary carcinoma*** | Jaundice + melaena (ulceration into duodenum); ampullary tumour visible on duodenoscopy at ERCP |
| | ***Lymphadenopathy*** (porta hepatis nodes) | History of lymphoma, metastatic disease; CT: enlarged nodes compressing CBD |
| | ***Mirizzi syndrome*** | Gallstone at Hartmann's pouch compressing CHD extrinsically; ***jaundice with palpable GB*** (exception to Courvoisier's Law); biliary dilatation above level of GB neck with normal CBD below [1][2] |

**Differentiating stone vs tumour at the bedside** — the critical clinical question [3]:

| Feature | ***Gallstone (Benign)*** | ***Malignant Biliary Obstruction*** |
|---|---|---|
| **Pain** | ***Present*** (colicky/RUQ) | ***Painless*** (or dull, progressive) |
| **Jaundice pattern** | ***Fluctuating / intermittent*** | ***Progressive, unrelenting*** |
| **Fever** | Common (cholangitis) | Uncommon (unless stent-related) |
| **Weight loss** | Uncommon | ***Marked*** |
| **Palpable GB** | ***Not palpable*** (fibrosed from chronic cholecystitis) | ***Palpable*** (Courvoisier's Law) |
| **Age** | Any age | ***Elderly*** |
| **History** | Previous biliary colic / stones | May have new-onset DM, back pain |

> ***Imaging approach*** [5]: ***Ultrasound / CT*** is first-line for obstructive jaundice to determine: (i) ***size of bile duct*** (dilated = obstructive), (ii) ***level of obstruction*** (intrahepatic vs hilar vs distal), (iii) ***cause of obstruction*** (stone vs mass), and (iv) ***other associated features*** (staging for malignant disease; complications for benign disease e.g., gallstones) [5].

#### 2.3 DDx of Fever + Jaundice + RUQ Pain (Cholangitis Presentation)

When the patient presents with ***Charcot's triad*** or ***Reynolds' pentad***, the differential includes [1]:

| Condition | How to Differentiate |
|---|---|
| ***Acute cholangitis*** (from choledocholithiasis) | Most common cause; dilated CBD with stone on USG; cholestatic LFT + leucocytosis |
| ***RPC*** | SE Asian patient; intrahepatic pigment stones; strictures on MRCP; recurrent episodes [1][2] |
| ***Acute cholecystitis with choledocholithiasis*** | Murphy's sign positive; GB wall thickening on USG; CBD may also be dilated |
| ***Liver abscess*** (pyogenic / amoebic) | Swinging fever; USG/CT: focal intrahepatic collection; blood cultures may grow gut organisms; no biliary dilatation unless secondary [1] |
| ***Infected choledochal cyst*** | Young patient (usually < 10y); RUQ mass + pain + jaundice + fever; USG: cystic dilatation of bile duct; MRCP for anatomy [5] |
| ***Biliary leaks*** (post-surgical) | History of recent biliary surgery; biloma on imaging |
| ***Acute pancreatitis*** | May coexist; epigastric pain radiating to back; ↑ amylase/lipase [1] |
| ***Acute hepatitis*** | Hepatocellular LFT pattern (AST/ALT > > ALP); viral serology positive |
| ***Malignant biliary obstruction with secondary infection*** | Progressive jaundice → superimposed infection (especially post-stent); mass on CT; CA19-9 elevated [3][5] |

#### 2.4 DDx of Acute Pancreatitis

When gallstone pancreatitis is suspected, you must exclude other causes of acute pancreatitis. The mnemonic ***GAME ID*** is useful [2]:

| Letter | Cause | Clue |
|---|---|---|
| **G** | ***Gallstones (MC — 55%)*** [4] | History of biliary colic; ***↑ ALP***; stones on USG |
| **A** | ***Alcohol (35%)*** [4] | History of binge drinking; ***↑ AST***; MCV elevated |
| **M** | ***Metabolic*** (hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercalcaemia) | Lipid panel; calcium level |
| **E** | ***ERCP*** (post-procedural) | Within 24h of ERCP |
| **I** | ***Idiopathic (10%)*** | Diagnosis of exclusion |
| **D** | ***Drugs*** (NSAIDs, steroids, azathioprine, valproate) | Drug history |
| | ***Others***: trauma, infections (mumps), autoimmune (SLE), tumours, pancreatic divisum | Context-dependent |

---

### 3. DDx of Gallbladder Polyps vs Gallstones on USG

This is a specific but commonly tested differentiation [2][5]:

| Feature | Gallstone | Gallbladder Polyp |
|---|---|---|
| **Gravity dependence** | ***Yes*** — moves with position change (rolling stone sign) | ***No*** — fixed to wall |
| **Posterior acoustic shadow** | ***Yes*** | ***No*** |
| **Shape** | Variable | Sessile or pedunculated |
| **Vascularity on Doppler** | None | May show flow |

<Callout title="Why does this matter?">
Polyps ≥ 1 cm carry significant malignant potential (up to 46% if 1.5 cm) and are an indication for cholecystectomy even if asymptomatic. Gallstones alone without symptoms can be observed. The USG characteristics above are how you tell them apart [2][5].
</Callout>

### 4. Important Principles to Distinguish Pre-hepatic, Hepatic, and Obstructive Jaundice

This is foundational to the differential diagnosis of any jaundice and highly relevant when a patient with "gallstones" presents with yellow skin [3]:

| Feature | Pre-hepatic (Haemolysis) | Hepatic (Hepatocellular) | Post-hepatic (Obstructive) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bilirubin type** | Unconjugated | Mixed | ***Conjugated*** |
| **Urine colour** | Normal | Dark | ***Tea-coloured*** (conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble → filtered by kidneys) |
| **Stool colour** | Normal/dark | Variable | ***Pale / clay-coloured*** (no bilirubin reaching gut) |
| **Pruritus** | No | ± | ***Yes*** (bile salt deposition in skin) |
| **LFT pattern** | ↑ unconj. bilirubin | ↑ AST/ALT > > ALP | ***↑ ALP, ↑ GGT > > AST/ALT*** |
| **Examples** | Thalassaemia, G6PD, sickle cell | Hepatitis, cirrhosis, drugs | ***Gallstones, tumours, PSC*** |

> History-taking tip from the senior notes [3]: Ask about ***urine colour*** (tea-coloured = obstructive) and ***stool colour*** (pale, floating, foul-smelling steatorrhoea = obstructive). Also exclude non-biliary causes of dark urine: rifampicin, Pyridium, beetroot [3].

---

### 5. Diagnostic Approach Algorithm

Once you suspect gallstone disease, the following algorithmic thinking helps you navigate the DDx:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["RUQ pain ± jaundice ± fever"] --> B["History + Examination"]
    B --> C{"Bloods: CBC, LFT, Amylase/Lipase"}
    C --> D{"LFT normal?"}
    D -->|Yes| E["Likely biliary colic or non-biliary cause"]
    D -->|No - Cholestatic pattern| F{"↑ Amylase/Lipase ≥ 3× ULN?"}
    F -->|Yes| G["Gallstone pancreatitis"]
    F -->|No| H{"Fever + leucocytosis?"}
    H -->|Yes| I{"Murphy's sign?"}
    I -->|Positive| J["Acute cholecystitis ± choledocholithiasis"]
    I -->|Negative| K["Acute cholangitis"]
    H -->|No| L["Choledocholithiasis or Malignant biliary obstruction"]
    L --> M{"USG / CT"}
    M --> N{"Stone seen? Duct dilated?"}
    N -->|"Stone + dilated CBD"| O["Choledocholithiasis"]
    N -->|"Mass + dilated ducts"| P["Malignant obstruction"]
    N -->|"No stone, no mass, dilated ducts"| Q["MRCP or EUS for further evaluation"]
    E --> R["USG gallbladder"]
    R --> S{"Stones seen?"}
    S -->|Yes| T["Biliary colic → Elective LC"]
    S -->|"No stones, polyp seen"| U["GB polyp → Assess size and morphology"]
    S -->|"Normal"| V["Consider non-biliary DDx: PUD, MI, pneumonia, renal colic"]
```

### 6. Less Common but Important Differentials (Hong Kong Context)

| Condition | Relevance | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC)*** | "Hong Kong disease" — must consider in any local patient with recurrent cholangitis + intrahepatic stones | Brown pigment stones in intrahepatic ducts (especially left lobe); ***stasis + stricturing + recurrent infection*** cycle; parasites (*Clonorchis sinensis*); complications include cholangiocarcinoma [1][2] |
| ***Choledochal cyst*** | Congenital dilatation of biliary system; most diagnosed before age 10 | RUQ mass + pain + jaundice + fever; pancreatitis; risk of cholangiocarcinoma; ***Todani classification*** (Type I most common); excision + Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy [2][5] |
| ***Cholangiocarcinoma*** | Can mimic choledocholithiasis with obstructive jaundice | Painless progressive jaundice; ***Klatskin tumour*** (perihilar) most common; ***CA 19-9*** elevated; differentiate from stone on MRCP (stricture without stone vs. filling defect) [1] |
| ***Pancreatic carcinoma*** | CA head of pancreas is the classic cause of painless obstructive jaundice | ***Double duct sign*** on CT; ***Courvoisier's sign*** positive (palpable non-tender GB); new-onset DM; weight loss [5][6] |
| ***IgG4-related cholangitis*** | Immune-mediated; can mimic cholangiocarcinoma | Mostly elderly males; ↑ serum IgG4; steroid-responsive; associated with autoimmune pancreatitis [3] |

<Callout title="High Yield DDx Summary for Exams">

When asked "DDx of gallstones", think systematically:

1. **Differentiate within gallstone complications first**: biliary colic vs cholecystitis vs choledocholithiasis vs cholangitis vs pancreatitis vs Mirizzi vs gallstone ileus — use pain duration, fever, jaundice, Murphy's sign, and labs.

2. **Then differentiate from non-gallstone mimics** based on the presenting complaint:
   - RUQ pain: PUD, hepatitis, liver abscess, appendicitis, RLL pneumonia, ***inferior MI***, renal colic
   - Obstructive jaundice: ***CA head of pancreas*** (Courvoisier +), cholangiocarcinoma, PSC, Mirizzi, choledochal cyst
   - Cholangitis: RPC, liver abscess, infected choledochal cyst, biliary leak
   - Pancreatitis: GAME ID (Gallstones, Alcohol, Metabolic, ERCP, Idiopathic, Drugs)

3. **Imaging first-line**: ***USG/CT*** to determine duct size, level of obstruction, cause, and associated features [5].

4. **Courvoisier's Law** helps distinguish stone from tumour: palpable GB + painless jaundice = tumour until proven otherwise.

5. **Polyp vs stone on USG**: polyp = fixed, no shadow; stone = gravity-dependent, posterior acoustic shadow.
