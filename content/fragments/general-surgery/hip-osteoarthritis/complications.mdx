## Complications of Hip Osteoarthritis

Complications of hip OA fall into two broad categories: (A) complications of the **disease itself** (untreated or progressive OA), and (B) complications of **treatment** (particularly surgical). Both are high-yield for exams. Let's work through each systematically, explaining the "why" from first principles.

---

### Part A: Complications of the Disease Itself

#### 1. Progressive Disability and Functional Decline

Hip OA is a **progressive** condition. Without intervention, the natural history is:

Cartilage loss → bone-on-bone contact → increasing pain → reduced mobility → muscle wasting → deformity → loss of independence

***OA is a serious disease*** [31]:
- ***Increased risk of cardiovascular/respiratory disorder*** — because reduced mobility → deconditioning → cardiovascular and pulmonary fitness decline. Chronic pain also activates the sympathetic nervous system → hypertension, tachycardia.
- ***Increased risks of psychological disorder*** — chronic pain and disability → depression, anxiety, social isolation. This is bidirectional: depression lowers the pain threshold, worsening perceived symptoms.
- ***Increased risks of sleep disturbance*** — night pain from subchondral bone stress and synovitis disrupts sleep architecture → fatigue → further deconditioning and worsened pain perception.
- ***Increased risk of mortality*** — not from OA directly, but from its downstream effects: reduced physical activity → cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome; opioid-related deaths; falls from impaired gait and balance.

<Callout title="OA is Not a 'Benign' Condition" type="error">
Students often dismiss OA as "just wear and tear." The lecture slides explicitly state: ***OA is a serious disease*** with increased mortality, cardiovascular/respiratory, psychological, and sleep-related complications [31]. This reframing is essential — it justifies aggressive early management (exercise, weight loss) and timely surgical intervention.
</Callout>

#### 2. Fixed Deformity

As hip OA progresses:
- The capsule contracts in the position of maximum volume (flexion, external rotation, adduction)
- Osteophytes create mechanical blocks
- Periarticular muscles shorten adaptively

This leads to **fixed flexion deformity** (Thomas test positive) and **fixed external rotation/adduction deformity**. The patient compensates with:
- **Increased lumbar lordosis** (to mask fixed flexion — extends the trunk to keep the body upright)
- **Contralateral knee flexion** (to equalise leg length)
- Both compensations lead to **secondary lumbar spine pain** and **contralateral knee OA** — a cascade of joint destruction.

#### 3. Gait Abnormalities

- ***Antalgic gait*** — shortened stance phase on the affected side (pain avoidance)
- ***Trendelenburg gait*** — hip abductor insufficiency from disuse atrophy, mechanical disadvantage (femoral head migration shortens the abductor lever arm), or direct muscle/nerve damage

These gait abnormalities increase **fall risk** in the elderly, which can lead to **fragility fractures** (femoral neck, distal radius, vertebral compression).

#### 4. Secondary OA of Adjacent Joints

Abnormal gait biomechanics place increased stress on:
- The **contralateral hip** (overloading to compensate for the affected side)
- The **ipsilateral and contralateral knees** (altered gait mechanics)
- The **lumbar spine** (increased lordosis from fixed hip flexion)

This "domino effect" of joint degeneration is a real clinical problem — it is why ***early referral for specialist care can significantly improve patient's function*** [12].

#### 5. Late Complications of Untreated Hip Pathology (Septic Arthritis, etc.)

The lecture slides specifically address ***late complications*** of hip joint pathology [32]:

- ***Secondary OA*** — ***pain due to joint incongruency and chondral damage***
- ***Stiffness due to ankylosis and soft tissue contracture (flexion and adduction contracture)***
- ***Deformity: angulation, coxa vara, shortening***
- ***Instability, dislocation***
- ***Leg length discrepancy***

While this slide pertains to complications following septic arthritis/infection, these same endpoints apply to **any untreated hip pathology** that leads to joint destruction — the final common pathway is secondary OA with deformity.

### Part B: Complications of Treatment

#### B1. Complications of Conservative/Medical Management

| Treatment | Complications | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Paracetamol** | ***Liver function abnormalities; elderly with impaired clearance*** [23] | Hepatotoxicity from NAPQI metabolite (normally conjugated by glutathione; overwhelmed in overdose or chronic use/impaired metabolism) |
| **NSAIDs** | GI bleeding/ulceration; renal impairment; cardiovascular events (MI, stroke); fluid retention, hypertension | COX-1 inhibition → reduced protective gastric prostaglandins; COX-mediated prostaglandins maintain renal blood flow; COX-2 inhibition shifts thromboxane/prostacyclin balance → prothrombotic state |
| ***Opioids*** | ***CNS depression, addiction*** [22]; ***sedation and dizziness predisposing to falls and fractures in elderly*** [24]; ***pre-operative opioid use predicts: greater opioid requirement post-surgery, prolonged hospital stay, greater in-hospital complications, early revision surgery*** [24] | μ-opioid receptor activation → respiratory depression, sedation, constipation, tolerance, physical dependence. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia paradoxically worsens pain with chronic use. |
| **Intra-articular steroid** | Cartilage degradation with repeated injections; infection (rare, ~1 in 50,000); post-injection flare; systemic glucose spike (in diabetics); soft tissue atrophy | Corticosteroids are catabolic to cartilage (inhibit proteoglycan synthesis, promote chondrocyte apoptosis). Repeated injections > 3–4/year may accelerate joint destruction. |
| **Bisphosphonates** (for AVN) | **Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)** [5] | Bisphosphonates suppress osteoclast-mediated bone resorption → impaired bone remodelling → jaw bone (which has high turnover due to dental stress) cannot heal → necrosis. Risk increased with IV formulations, dental procedures, and prolonged use. |

#### B2. Complications of Total Hip Replacement (THR)

These are **extremely high-yield** and explicitly listed in the senior notes [2][33]:

***Specific complications of THR***: ***thromboembolism, dislocation, infection of prosthesis, leg length discrepancy*** [2]

The senior notes provide a temporal classification [33]:

##### Immediate Complications (Intraoperative / < 24 hours)

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bone fracture*** [33] | Intraoperative: reaming of the acetabulum or femoral canal; impaction of uncemented components into osteoporotic bone | **Periprosthetic fracture** — particularly of the femoral shaft during stem insertion. More common with uncemented stems in osteoporotic bone. Classified by Vancouver classification (A: trochanteric; B: around/just below stem; C: well below stem). |
| ***Vascular injury (femoral artery in THR)*** [33] | The femoral artery and vein lie anterior to the hip joint. Retractors placed on the anterior acetabular wall can compress or lacerate the external iliac/femoral vessels. | Rare but catastrophic. More common in revision surgery or with anterior approaches. Presents with acute haemorrhage or post-operative swelling/shock. |
| ***Nerve injury (sciatic nerve in THR)*** [33] | ***Sciatic nerve injury*** [2] — the sciatic nerve runs posterior to the hip joint, directly in the field of the **posterior approach**. Risk increased with limb lengthening > 4 cm (stretch injury). | Presents with foot drop (common peroneal component most vulnerable — superficial and wrapped around fibular neck). ***Superior gluteal nerve injury*** with the ***anterolateral (modified Hardinge) approach*** [2] → abductor weakness → Trendelenburg gait. |
| **Bleeding** | Surgical trauma to periarticular vessels; bone cut surfaces ooze | May require transfusion. Minimised by tranexamic acid (anti-fibrinolytic — blocks plasmin-mediated clot breakdown). |

##### Early Complications (Days to Weeks)

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|---|---|---|
| ***DVT / PE (Thromboembolism)*** [2] | **Virchow's triad**: (1) Venous stasis (immobility post-op), (2) Endothelial injury (surgical trauma, heat from cement polymerisation), (3) Hypercoagulability (post-operative inflammatory response, tissue factor release) | DVT affects up to 40–60% of patients without prophylaxis. PE is the most feared complication — can be fatal. **Prophylaxis**: mechanical (TED stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression, early mobilisation) + pharmacological (LMWH e.g. enoxaparin, or DOACs e.g. rivaroxaban, for 28–35 days post-op). |
| ***Infection (early)*** [33] | Bacterial inoculation at the time of surgery; haematogenous seeding from distant sites (UTI, dental) | ***Infection is difficult to detect and treat*** [33]. Early infection (< 4 weeks): acute pain, wound erythema, discharge, fever, elevated CRP. Commonest organisms: *Staphylococcus aureus*, coagulase-negative staphylococci. Prevention: laminar flow theatres, prophylactic IV antibiotics (e.g., cefazolin at induction), MRSA screening [11]. |
| **Cement reaction** (Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome — BCIS) | PMMA cement polymerisation → exothermic reaction + monomer toxicity + fat/marrow embolisation → acute hypotension, hypoxia, cardiac arrest | Occurs during cemented femoral stem insertion. The pressurised cement forces fat, marrow, and cement particles into the venous system → emboli → cardiopulmonary compromise. Can be fatal. Prevention: lavage and suction of femoral canal before cementing, slow insertion, maintain intravascular volume. |

##### Late Complications (Weeks to Years)

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|---|---|---|
| ***Dislocation*** [2] | Femoral head dislocates from the acetabular cup. Most common direction: **posterior** (especially with posterior approach — posterior capsule and short external rotators are divided). | Risk factors: posterior approach, component malpositioning (excessive anteversion/retroversion), soft tissue laxity, non-compliance with hip precautions, neuromuscular disease. **Prevention post-op**: ***do not squat / cross legs / flex hip > 90°, abduction pillow, high-low chair*** [7]. Incidence: 2–5% (posterior approach); lower with anterior approach. If recurrent, may need revision surgery with constrained liner or dual-mobility cup. |
| ***Prosthesis infection (periprosthetic joint infection — PJI)*** [2] | **Early PJI** (< 4 weeks): direct surgical contamination. **Delayed PJI** (4 weeks – 1 year): low-virulence organisms (e.g., *Cutibacterium acnes*). **Late PJI** ( > 1 year): haematogenous seeding from distant infection (dental, urinary, skin). Biofilm formation on the prosthesis surface protects bacteria from antibiotics and host immunity. | Most devastating complication. Diagnosis: joint aspiration (cell count, culture), CRP, ESR, intra-operative histology. Management: debridement + antibiotic exchange (DAIR) for early infection with well-fixed components; two-stage revision (explant → antibiotic spacer → 6–12 weeks IV antibiotics → reimplant) for chronic infection; one-stage revision (explant and reimplant in single sitting) gaining evidence. **Lifelong precautions**: antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures (controversial but commonly practised). |
| ***Leg length discrepancy (LLD)*** [2] | Intentional or unintentional lengthening/shortening during THR. The surgeon adjusts component positioning and femoral offset, but achieving perfect leg length equality is challenging. | ***Must counsel patients beforehand*** [33]. Perceived LLD > 1 cm is often symptomatic. May cause: gait asymmetry, back pain, patient dissatisfaction, sciatic nerve stretch (if lengthened excessively). Prevention: intra-operative measurement, templating, and fluoroscopy. Management: shoe raise for residual LLD. |
| **Aseptic loosening** | The most common reason for **revision surgery**. Wear particles (polyethylene, metal, ceramic) are phagocytosed by macrophages → release pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1, IL-6) → activate osteoclasts → **periprosthetic osteolysis** → component loosening. | Presents with gradually increasing pain years after surgery (cf. infection which has a more acute presentation with systemic features). X-ray: progressive radiolucent lines around the prosthesis, component migration. Management: revision THR (exchange worn components + bone grafting for osteolytic defects). |
| **Wear and bearing failure** | Articulating surfaces wear over time. Polyethylene → particulate debris → osteolysis (as above). Metal-on-metal → metallosis (cobalt/chromium ions → pseudotumour, ALVAL — adverse local tissue reaction). Ceramic → fracture (rare). | ***Survival of replacement (not requiring revision surgery): 15–20 years*** [33]. This is why THR is preferably performed in older patients — fewer lifetime years of wear = lower chance of needing revision. Younger, more active patients wear out prostheses faster. |
| **Heterotopic ossification (HO)** | Abnormal bone formation in periarticular soft tissues after surgical trauma. Ectopic bone forming in muscle/capsule restricts hip ROM. | Risk factors: male sex, ankylosing spondylitis, previous HO, extensive surgical dissection. Prevention: single-dose radiation therapy (700 cGy within 24 hours post-op) or indomethacin for 6 weeks (COX inhibition reduces osteoblast differentiation). Grading: Brooker classification (I–IV). |
| **Periprosthetic fracture** | Fracture of the femur around a prosthetic stem, usually from a fall or minor trauma in osteoporotic bone. | Classified by Vancouver system: Type A (trochanteric — often conservative), Type B (around/below stem — may need revision ± ORIF), Type C (below stem — treat as standard fracture). |

<Callout title="The Big Four Complications of THR to Always Mention" type="idea">
When asked about complications of THR in an exam, the four you **must** mention (as per the senior notes [2]) are:
1. ***Thromboembolism*** (DVT/PE)
2. ***Dislocation***
3. ***Infection of prosthesis***
4. ***Leg length discrepancy***

Then add: nerve injury (sciatic — posterior approach; superior gluteal — anterolateral), periprosthetic fracture, aseptic loosening, and heterotopic ossification for extra marks.
</Callout>

#### B3. Complications of Other Surgical Procedures

| Procedure | Specific Complications |
|---|---|
| **Osteotomy** | Non-union, malunion, delayed union, neurovascular injury, conversion to THR may be technically more difficult if osteotomy fails |
| **Core decompression (for AVN)** | Femoral fracture through the drill tract (weakened cortex), haematoma, infection, failure to halt progression |
| **Arthroscopy** | ***DVT (0.4%), PE (0.1%), death (0.03%)*** [28]; ***increases rate of progression of OA; shortens time to joint replacement*** [28] — this is why arthroscopic debridement has a **very limited role** in OA |

---

### Post-Operative Care and Prevention of Complications

***Post-op after THR*** [33]:
- ***Early mobilisation (1 day after operation)*** — reduces DVT risk, prevents deconditioning, promotes bone-prosthesis integration
- ***Avoid contact sports, extreme ROM of hip (angle of bed < 45°)*** — reduces dislocation risk
- ***Prevent dislocation: do not squat / cross legs / flex hip > 90°, abduction pillow, high-low chair*** [7]
- **VTE prophylaxis**: mechanical (TED stockings, IPC, early mobilisation) + pharmacological (LMWH/DOAC for 28–35 days)
- **Infection surveillance**: monitor wound, CRP trend, temperature
- **Physiotherapy**: progressive weight-bearing, gait training, abductor strengthening

***Follow-up***: ***Harris Hip Score*** [16] — serial assessments to track pain relief, functional improvement, and detect early complications.

### Summary — Complication Timeline

| Timing | Complications |
|---|---|
| **Disease-related** | Progressive disability, fixed deformity (flexion/ER/adduction contracture), Trendelenburg gait, secondary OA of adjacent joints, falls/fractures, cardiovascular/psychological/sleep complications |
| **Immediate (intra-op)** | Bone fracture, vascular injury (femoral artery), nerve injury (sciatic, superior gluteal), cement reaction (BCIS) |
| **Early (days–weeks)** | DVT/PE, wound infection, early PJI, dislocation |
| **Late (months–years)** | Aseptic loosening (most common cause of revision), chronic PJI, wear/osteolysis, LLD, heterotopic ossification, periprosthetic fracture |

2. **Disease complications**: progressive disability, fixed flexion/ER/adduction deformity, Trendelenburg gait, secondary OA of adjacent joints, falls.
3. **Late complications of hip pathology** (from lecture slides): secondary OA, stiffness/ankylosis/contracture, deformity (angulation, coxa vara, shortening), instability/dislocation, leg length discrepancy.
4. **The Big Four THR complications**: thromboembolism (DVT/PE), dislocation, prosthesis infection, leg length discrepancy.
5. **Nerve injury by approach**: Posterior → sciatic nerve; Anterolateral → superior gluteal nerve.
6. **Dislocation prevention**: no squatting, no crossing legs, no hip flexion > 90°, abduction pillow, high-low chair.
7. **Aseptic loosening** is the most common reason for revision THR — caused by wear particle-induced osteolysis.
8. **PJI** is the most devastating complication — biofilm formation makes eradication difficult; often requires two-stage revision.
