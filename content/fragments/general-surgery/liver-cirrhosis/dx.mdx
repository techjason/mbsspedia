## Diagnostic Criteria, Algorithm, and Investigations for Liver Cirrhosis

The diagnosis of cirrhosis is not made by a single test, but rather by synthesizing evidence from the clinical presentation, blood tests, imaging, and sometimes histology. The goals are twofold: **1) To confirm the presence of cirrhosis and assess its severity, and 2) To identify the underlying etiology**, as this directly determines management.

### Diagnostic Criteria: A Composite Picture

There is no single "diagnostic criteria" checklist for cirrhosis itself. Instead, diagnosis is based on a combination of findings. For **compensated cirrhosis** (often asymptomatic), the diagnosis may be subtle and rely more on imaging or biopsy. For **decompensated cirrhosis**, the presence of clear complications (ascites, variceal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy) in the right clinical context is often sufficient.

However, for specific diseases *causing* cirrhosis, there are established criteria:

*   **Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC):** Diagnosis requires at least 2 of the following: 1) **ALP ≥ 1.5x ULN**, 2) **Positive AMA at titer ≥1:40**, and 3) Histologic evidence of non-suppurative destructive cholangitis [1][10].
*   **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC):** In a cirrhotic liver, a liver lesion >1 cm with the **typical vascular pattern on dynamic imaging (arterial hyperenhancement and venous/delayed phase washout)** is diagnostic without the need for biopsy [8][11].

The functional severity of cirrhosis is formally classified using the **Child-Pugh Score** (which grades from A to C) and quantified by the **Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score**, critical for transplant prioritization.

### Diagnostic Algorithm: A Stepwise Approach

When cirrhosis is suspected, follow a logical, tiered investigation strategy. The following algorithm outlines the pathway from initial suspicion to confirmation and etiological diagnosis.

### Investigation Modalities and Key Findings

#### 1. Blood Tests: The Functional and Etiological Clues

Blood tests assess the liver's synthetic and metabolic function and point to the cause.

**A. Complete Blood Count (CBC) & Clotting Profile**
*   **Thrombocytopenia:** ***A common finding.*** Caused by: 1) **Portal hypertension-induced splenomegaly and hypersplenism** (platelet sequestration), and 2) **Decreased hepatic production of thrombopoietin** [3].
*   **Leukopenia:** Also due to hypersplenism.
*   **Anemia:** Multifactorial: chronic disease, gastrointestinal blood loss (varices, gastropathy), nutritional deficiencies (folate in alcoholics), and direct alcohol toxicity.
*   **Prolonged PT/INR:** Reflects impaired synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X). ***Factor VII has the shortest half-life (~6 hours), so an isolated prolonged PT/INR is often the earliest lab sign of synthetic dysfunction*** [3]. It can also be due to vitamin K malabsorption from cholestasis.

**B. Liver Function Tests (LFTs) & Biochemistry**
*   **Bilirubin:** May be normal in compensation. A rising bilirubin indicates worsening liver function or superimposed events (e.g., alcoholic hepatitis, cholangitis).
*   **Aminotransferases (AST, ALT):** Often only mildly elevated. ***A characteristic AST:ALT ratio >1 (often ~2:1) is suggestive of cirrhosis***, especially alcoholic etiology. *Why?* AST is mitochondrial and is released with more severe cell injury; ALT is cytosolic. In advanced fibrosis, ALT production may be diminished.
*   **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) & GGT:** Mild elevations are common. ***Marked elevation (e.g., >3x ULN) suggests a cholestatic component*** (e.g., PBC, PSC, biliary obstruction) [4]. GGT is particularly sensitive to alcohol use.
*   **Albumin:** ***Hypoalbuminemia is a key marker of chronic synthetic failure*** (albumin half-life ~20 days). It contributes to peripheral edema and ascites formation by lowering plasma oncotic pressure.
*   **Globulins:** ***Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia*** is common, leading to a **reversed A:G ratio**. *Mechanism:* Portosystemic shunting allows gut-derived antigens to bypass the liver's Kupffer cells, leading to sustained B-cell stimulation in the spleen and lymph nodes [3][4].
*   **Renal Function & Electrolytes:** Hyponatremia is common due to **non-osmotic ADH release** from effective arterial hypovolemia. Rising creatinine may indicate hepatorenal syndrome.

**C. Etiology-Specific Serology & Markers**
*   ***Viral Hepatitis:*** **HBsAg, Anti-HCV.** In HBV, check HBeAg/Ab and HBV DNA. In HCV, check HCV RNA. ***In Hong Kong, Hepatitis B serology is the most critical test*** [1][2].
*   ***Autoimmune:*** **ANA** (Autoimmune Hepatitis), **AMA** (PBC), **p-ANCA** (PSC).
*   ***Metabolic:*** **Ferritin, Transferrin Saturation** (Hemochromatosis), **Ceruloplasmin** (Wilson's), **Alpha-1 Antitrypsin level and phenotype**.
*   ***Tumour Marker:*** **Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)**. Used for HCC screening. ***>400 ng/mL is highly suggestive of HCC***, but levels can be elevated in active hepatitis and regeneration. ***30% of HCC patients have normal AFP*** [9][11].
*   ***Others:*** **IgG4** (for IgG4-related disease mimicking PSC), **CA 19-9** (cholangiocarcinoma).

#### 2. Imaging: Visualizing Structure and Consequences

**A. Abdominal Ultrasound (USG) – First-Line Imaging**
*   ***Findings of Cirrhosis:*** **Surface nodularity, coarse heterogeneous echotexture, atrophy of the right lobe with hypertrophy of the caudate/left lobe** [5].
*   ***Findings of Portal Hypertension:*** **Splenomegaly, ascites, collateral vessels (e.g., recanalized umbilical vein), portal vein dilatation (>13mm), and reduced/ reversed portal vein flow** [5].
*   ***Additional Role:*** Screening for **HCC** (any solid nodule >1 cm needs further investigation) and detecting **portal vein thrombosis**.

**B. Transient Elastography (FibroScan)**
*   ***A non-invasive method to estimate liver stiffness, correlating with fibrosis stage.*** It uses a shear wave to measure propagation speed; stiffer (fibrotic) livers transmit the wave faster. It is excellent for diagnosing advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis and monitoring progression. Values >12-15 kPa are highly suggestive of cirrhosis.

**C. Cross-Sectional Imaging (CT/MRI)**
*   Not for routine cirrhosis diagnosis, but crucial for:
    1.  **Characterizing focal lesions** found on USG.
    2.  **Detailed assessment of vascular anatomy** (for transplant or TACE planning).
    3.  **Evaluating for HCC.** ***Triphasic (multiphase) CT or MRI is the gold standard imaging for HCC diagnosis.*** The classic hallmark is **"wash-in and washout"** – the lesion enhances brightly in the **arterial phase** (hepatic artery supply) and becomes hypodense/intense relative to the liver in the **portal venous/delayed phase** [8][9].
    4.  **MRI** is superior for characterizing certain nodules, assessing iron overload (hemochromatosis), or copper deposition (Wilson's).

#### 3. Invasive Diagnostic Procedures

**A. Liver Biopsy – The Histological Gold Standard**
*   **Indications:** When diagnosis is uncertain despite non-invasive tests, in suspected autoimmune hepatitis, or to assess disease activity and stage (e.g., NASH activity score).
*   **Histological Diagnosis:** Confirms the triad of **bridging fibrosis, regenerative nodules, and architectural distortion** [5][6].
*   **Limitations:** Invasive, risk of bleeding (correct coagulopathy first), sampling error.

**B. Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (HVPG) Measurement**
*   A catheter is placed in the hepatic vein to measure the gradient between the wedged (occluded) and free pressures. This directly measures sinusoidal pressure.
*   **Normal HVPG:** 1-5 mmHg.
*   ***Clinically Significant Portal Hypertension:*** **HVPG ≥10 mmHg** – threshold for developing varices and ascites [7].
*   **Used for:** Confirming portal hypertension, assessing response to therapy (e.g., beta-blockers for varices), and in clinical trials.

**C. Diagnostic Paracentesis**
*   ***The first step in the evaluation of new-onset ascites in a cirrhotic patient*** [6].
*   **Analyze:** Cell count (neutrophil count >250/mm³ diagnoses Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis), culture, albumin (to calculate SAAG), and cytology if malignancy is suspected.
*   **Serum-Ascites Albumin Gradient (SAAG):** **SAAG ≥1.1 g/dL** confirms portal hypertension as the cause of ascites (high accuracy).

<Callout title="High-Yield Diagnostic Synthesis">
1.  **Compensated Cirrhosis:** Often diagnosed via **Ultrasound nodularity + FibroScan stiffness >15 kPa + Thrombocytopenia**. Etiology is pinned down by bloods (HBsAg, etc.).
2.  **Decompensated Cirrhosis:** Clinically obvious (ascites, encephalopathy). Workup focuses on **assessing severity (Child-Pugh/MELD) and screening for complications** (USG for HCC, endoscopy for varices).
3.  **HCC Diagnosis in Cirrhosis:** **Lesion >1cm on USG → Multiphasic CT/MRI showing arterial hyperenhancement and washout = Diagnostic.** AFP supports but is not required.
4.  **Child-Pugh Score:** Memorize the parameters (Albumin, Bilirubin, INR, Ascites, Encephalopathy). It's a classic exam question for prognosis and surgical risk.
