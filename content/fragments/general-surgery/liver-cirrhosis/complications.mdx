## Common Complications of Liver Cirrhosis

The transition from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis is marked by the development of specific, often life-threatening complications. These arise from the two fundamental consequences of cirrhosis: **portal hypertension** and **hepatocellular failure**. Understanding each complication's unique pathophysiology is key to anticipating, diagnosing, and managing them.

### 1. Ascites and Edema

**_The most common complication of cirrhosis and the most frequent first decompensating event._** [1]

- **Pathophysiology:** This isn't just about low albumin. It's a hemodynamic cascade:
  1.  **Portal Hypertension** (HVPG ≥10 mmHg) [2] → Splanchnic arterial vasodilation (from excess nitric oxide).
  2.  This leads to **effective arterial hypovolemia** (the arteries are too dilated, so the body senses low blood volume).
  3.  This triggers the **activation of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)** and the sympathetic nervous system.
  4.  Result: **Sodium and water retention** by the kidneys.
  5.  The retained fluid, driven by the high portal pressure and **hypoalbuminemia** (which reduces plasma oncotic pressure), leaks into the peritoneal cavity as ascites and into the interstitial spaces as peripheral edema.
- **Clinical Features:** Abdominal distension, increased waist size, flank dullness, shifting dullness, fluid thrill. Lower limb pitting edema is often concomitant.
- **Key Point:** **_Diagnostic paracentesis is the FIRST step in the evaluation of new-onset ascites_** to rule out infection (SBP) and confirm the cause [1].

### 2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)

A life-threatening infection of ascitic fluid **without a surgically treatable source**. It's a classic example of how cirrhosis disrupts host defense.

- **Pathophysiology:**
  - **Bacterial Translocation:** Gut bacteria migrate across the edematous, congested intestinal wall into the mesenteric lymph nodes.
  - **Impaired Clearance:** Portosystemic shunting bypasses the liver's Kupffer cells (the body's filter), allowing bacteria to reach the systemic circulation.
  - **Vulnerable Fluid:** Ascitic fluid has **low opsonic activity** (low complement and immunoglobulin levels), making it a poor culture medium for killing bacteria [3].
- **Diagnosis:** Ascitic fluid neutrophil count **> 250 cells/mm³**. Culture may be negative (Culture-Negative Neutrocytic Ascites), but treatment is still required.
- **Clinical Features:** May be subtle – fever, mild abdominal pain, worsening encephalopathy, or renal function. Can also present with no symptoms.

### 3. Variceal Hemorrhage

**_The most dramatic and immediately life-threatening complication._** Mortality from the first bleed is 20-30%.

- **Pathophysiology:** Portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mmHg) [2] forces blood through collateral vessels. The **esophageal and gastric varices** are thin-walled and prone to rupture. Rupture risk is driven by the tension on the variceal wall (Laplace's law: tension ∝ pressure x radius / wall thickness).
- **Clinical Features:** Sudden, painless, large-volume **hematemesis** (vomiting bright red blood) and/or **melena**. May present with hypovolemic shock.
- **_Why it's deadly:_** The combination of hypovolemia, impaired synthetic function (coagulopathy), and the stress of bleeding can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and infection.

### 4. Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)

A spectrum of neuropsychiatric disturbances caused by the liver's failure to detoxify gut-derived substances.

- **Pathophysiology:** The central theory involves **hyperammonemia**. The failing liver cannot convert ammonia (NH₃) to urea. Portosystemic shunting also allows ammonia to bypass the liver. Ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier, causing astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema, disrupting neurotransmission.
- **Clinical Spectrum:** Ranges from **minimal HE** (poor concentration, psychometric defects) to **overt HE** (confusion, personality change, asterixis - "liver flap", drowsiness, coma).
- **Precipitants:** **_Always search for a trigger:_** Infection (SBP!), GI bleed, constipation, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, sedatives, or high protein intake [4].

### 5. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS)

**_A functional, potentially reversible renal failure in advanced cirrhosis._** It is a diagnosis of exclusion.

- **Pathophysiology:** A severe progression of the same hemodynamic derangement causing ascites.
  1.  Profound splanchnic vasodilation leads to severe effective hypovolemia.
  2.  This causes intense renal vasoconstriction (via RAAS and SNS) to maintain systemic blood pressure.
  3.  The result is drastically **reduced renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)**, but the renal tubules themselves are intact (hence "functional").
- **Types:**
  - **Type 1 HRS:** Rapid, progressive renal failure (doubling of creatinine to >2.5 mg/dL in < 2 weeks). Often triggered by SBP or GI bleed. **Dismal prognosis.**
  - **Type 2 HRS:** Steady, moderate renal impairment (creatinine 1.5-2.5 mg/dL). Usually associated with **refractory ascites**.
- **Diagnostic Clues:** Oliguria, rising creatinine, very low urine sodium (< 10 mmol/L), and bland urine sediment (no cells/casts).

### 6. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

**_The most common primary liver cancer and a major cause of death in cirrhotic patients._** Cirrhosis is the single greatest risk factor.

- **Epidemiology in HK:** **_80% of HCC in Hong Kong occurs in HBsAg-positive individuals_** [5]. **_HCC complicates HCV almost exclusively on a background of cirrhosis (100%), while it can occur in non-cirrhotic livers in HBV (20%) due to HBV's direct oncogenic effect_** [6].
- **Pathogenesis:** Chronic inflammation, hepatocyte regeneration, and genetic mutations (e.g., p53 from aflatoxin) lead to dysplastic nodules and eventually HCC. The whole cirrhotic liver is at risk ("**field cancerization**").
- **Why Prognosis is Often Poor:** Patients are often asymptomatic until the tumor is large (>8 cm) [7]. The underlying cirrhosis limits treatment options (resection, transplant) and predisposes to liver failure post-treatment. HCC also has a high propensity for **vascular invasion (portal vein thrombosis)** and intrahepatic metastasis [5].
- **Screening:** All cirrhotic patients should have **6-monthly ultrasound and AFP** surveillance.

### 7. Other Cardiopulmonary Complications

- **Hepatic Hydrothorax:** Pleural effusion (usually right-sided) due to passage of ascitic fluid through diaphragmatic defects. Managed like ascites.
- **Hepatopulmonary Syndrome (HPS):** Triad of cirrhosis, hypoxemia, and intrapulmonary vascular dilatations. Patients develop platypnea (shortness of breath when upright) and orthodeoxia (worsening hypoxia when upright). **Clubbing is common.**
- **Portopulmonary Hypertension (POPH):** Pulmonary arterial hypertension (mean PA pressure >25 mmHg) in the setting of portal hypertension. Presents with dyspnea, fatigue, and can lead to right heart failure.
- **Cirrhotic Cardiomyopathy:** Impaired cardiac contractility and response to stress in the setting of cirrhosis, despite a normal or high resting cardiac output. Can unmask during procedures like TIPS or transplant.

### 8. Complications Specific to Cholestatic Liver Diseases (PBC/PSC)

- **Pruritus:** Debilitating itching due to retained bile acids and other pruritogens. Worse at night.
- **Steatorrhea & Fat-Soluble Vitamin (A, D, E, K) Deficiency:** Due to reduced bile acid secretion, impairing fat digestion and absorption. Can lead to night blindness (Vit A), osteomalacia/osteoporosis (Vit D), neuropathy (Vit E), and coagulopathy (Vit K).
- **Hepatic Osteodystrophy:** Metabolic bone disease (osteoporosis/osteopenia) from vitamin D deficiency, chronic inflammation, and direct inhibitory effects of cholestasis on osteoblasts.
- **Hyperlipidemia:** Particularly in PBC, with a characteristic elevation of lipoprotein-X. Notably, this does not seem to increase atherosclerotic risk.
- **Cholangiocarcinoma:** **_A major life-threatening complication of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)._** The risk is lifelong, and screening with MRI/MRCP and CA19-9 is recommended.

  **HCC is a Constant Threat:** In Hong Kong, think **HBV**. Screen all
