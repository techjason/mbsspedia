## Definition

Liver cirrhosis is not just a disease, but the **end-stage anatomical consequence** of sustained, chronic liver injury. Think of it as the liver's "scar tissue response" gone too far. It's defined by three key, interconnected pathological hallmarks that you can see under the microscope:

1.  **Diffuse Hepatic Fibrosis:** This isn't just a small scar. It's a widespread deposition of abnormal, dense collagen (predominantly Type I) that forms a spiderweb-like network throughout the liver. This replaces the normal, delicate extracellular matrix.
2.  **Nodular Regeneration:** The surviving hepatocytes, trapped in this fibrous web, attempt to regenerate. However, because the normal scaffolding is destroyed, they form clumps called **regenerative nodules**. These nodules are not functional liver units (lobules) and lack a central vein and portal triads.
3.  **Architectural Distortion:** The combination of fibrosis and nodules completely disrupts the liver's normal microscopic and macroscopic structure. The organized portal triads and central veins are lost. This is the key difference from simple hepatic fibrosis, where the architecture is preserved.

<Callout title="The Pathologist's Diagnosis" type="idea">
  The gold standard for diagnosing cirrhosis is a liver biopsy. The pathologist
  is looking for that classic triad: **bridging fibrosis** (bands of scar tissue
  connecting portal areas to central veins), **nodules**, and **architectural
  distortion**. Without all three, it's not cirrhosis.
</Callout>

**Reversibility:** This is a critical concept. _Early_ cirrhosis, often termed "compensated cirrhosis," may be reversible if the underlying cause is aggressively treated (e.g., curing Hepatitis C, abstinence in alcohol-related disease, chelation in hemochromatosis). However, _advanced_ cirrhosis with extensive nodularity and portal hypertension becomes irreversible. At this stage, the only curative treatment is **liver transplantation**.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Globally, the leading causes of cirrhosis are **Hepatitis B (HBV), Hepatitis C (HCV), and Alcohol-Related Liver Disease (ALD)**. However, the epidemiology in Hong Kong has its own distinct profile, largely driven by the high prevalence of HBV.

**_In Hong Kong, Chronic Hepatitis B is the overwhelming cause of liver cirrhosis._** The carrier rate in the general population is approximately 7-8%, a legacy of pre-vaccination era vertical transmission. A significant proportion of these carriers progress to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

<Callout title="Key HK Context">
*   **HBV is King:** HBV accounts for **over 90%** of cirrhosis cases in Hong Kong. This is a must-know fact.
*   **HCV is Less Common:** HCV prevalence is relatively low in the general HK population (< 1%).
*   **Rising Trend:** Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and its more aggressive form, Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), are becoming increasingly important causes due to the rising rates of obesity and metabolic syndrome.
</Callout>

### Global and Local Risk Factors

- **Viral Hepatitis:** **_Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV)_**. Chronic infection leads to persistent immune-mediated inflammation, hepatocyte death, and eventually fibrosis. _HBV also has direct oncogenic properties_ (via the HBx protein), which can promote carcinogenesis even before cirrhosis develops.
- **Alcohol:** Chronic, excessive alcohol consumption is a major cause. Risk is dose-dependent (typically >60-80g/day for men, >20g/day for women over 10+ years). Ethanol metabolism generates toxic metabolites (acetaldehyde) and causes oxidative stress, leading to steatosis, hepatitis, and fibrosis.
- **Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD):** This is the new terminology (as of 2023) replacing NAFLD. It's tightly linked to insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. A subset progresses to MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), which can lead to cirrhosis.
- **Autoimmune & Biliary Diseases:**
  - **Autoimmune Hepatitis:** Immune system attacks hepatocytes.
  - **Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC):** Immune-mediated destruction of small intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis and cirrhosis. **_Strong female predominance (F:M ~9:1) and association with other autoimmune conditions like Sjögren's syndrome and thyroiditis._**
  - **Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC):** Inflammation and fibrosis of both intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts, creating a "beaded" appearance on imaging. **_Strongly associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), especially Ulcerative Colitis._**
- **Genetic/Metabolic Disorders:**
  - **Hemochromatosis (HFE gene):** Autosomal recessive disorder of iron overload. Excess iron deposits in hepatocytes, catalyzing free radical formation and fibrosis.
  - **Wilson's Disease (ATP7B gene):** Autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Copper accumulation in the liver is directly toxic.
  - **Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency:** Mutant protein (PiZZ) polymerizes and gets trapped in hepatocytes, causing injury.
- **Vascular:** Chronic right-sided heart failure (e.g., severe tricuspid regurgitation, constrictive pericarditis) leads to **congestive hepatopathy**. Sustained high pressure in the hepatic veins backs up into the sinusoids, causing centrilobular congestion, atrophy, and fibrosis ("nutmeg liver").
- **Drugs/Toxins:** Certain medications are notorious for causing chronic liver injury that can progress to cirrhosis, e.g., **methotrexate** (cumulative dose-related), **amiodarone** (can cause a steatohepatitis-like picture), and high-dose vitamin A.

## Anatomy and Function (Relevance to Cirrhosis)

To understand why cirrhosis causes its myriad complications, you must first understand the liver's dual blood supply and its microarchitecture.

### 1. Vascular Anatomy: The Dual Supply

- **Portal Vein (75% of blood flow):** Brings nutrient-rich, deoxygenated blood from the intestines, spleen, and stomach to the liver. It also carries gut-derived bacterial products and toxins.
- **Hepatic Artery (25% of blood flow):** Brings oxygenated blood from the celiac trunk.

These two vessels branch together into the liver at the **portal triads** (portal vein, hepatic artery, bile duct). Blood from both sources mixes in the **hepatic sinusoids** (the liver's capillaries), bathes the hepatocytes, and then drains into the **central vein**. Central veins coalesce into hepatic veins, which drain into the **Inferior Vena Cava (IVC)**.

### 2. The Functional Unit: The Hepatic Lobule vs. The Acinus

- **Classic Lobule (Hexagonal):** Centered on the **central vein**. Blood flows from the periphery (portal triads) towards the center.
- **Rappaport's Liver Acinus (More Physiologically Relevant):** Zones hepatocytes based on their oxygen and nutrient supply.
  - **Zone 1 (Periportal):** Closest to the portal triad. Gets the best oxygen/nutrient supply. Rich in mitochondria for oxidative metabolism. Site of urea and glutamine synthesis, bile acid-independent bile flow, and cholesterol synthesis.
  - **Zone 2 (Midzonal):** Intermediate.
  - **Zone 3 (Pericentral/Centrilobular):** Surrounds the central vein. Most vulnerable to injury from ischemia (low O2) and toxic metabolites (e.g., from alcohol, acetaminophen). Site of cytochrome P450 detoxification, glycolysis, lipogenesis, and bile acid-dependent bile flow.

<Callout title="Why Zone 3 is the 'Canary in the Coal Mine'">
  Many toxins (like alcohol and acetaminophen) are metabolized by cytochrome
  P450 enzymes in Zone 3. This process can generate toxic intermediates that
  cause oxidative damage right where they're produced. Additionally, Zone 3 is
  the last to receive oxygen, making it most susceptible to ischemic injury.
  This is why many toxic and ischemic insults show a **centrilobular (Zone 3)
  pattern of necrosis**.
</Callout>

### 3. The Sinusoidal Lining & Space of Disse

The sinusoid is a unique, fenestrated (has holes) capillary. Lining it are:

- **Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells (LSECs):** These are highly fenestrated, allowing easy passage of small molecules from blood to hepatocytes.
- **Hepatic Stellate Cells (HSCs):** These live in the **Space of Disse** (the space between the sinusoid and hepatocytes). In health, they store vitamin A. **In injury, they are the master regulators of fibrosis.** They become "activated," transforming into myofibroblast-like cells that proliferate and produce massive amounts of collagen (Types I and III), laying down the fibrous scar.

### 4. Key Functions Affected in Cirrhosis

- **Synthesis:** Albumin, coagulation factors (except Factor VIII), cholesterol, carrier proteins.
- **Metabolism:** Gluconeogenesis, glycogen storage, ammonia → urea (detoxification).
- **Detoxification & Excretion:** Bilirubin conjugation, drug metabolism, bile acid synthesis and secretion.
- **Immune & Filter Function:** Kupffer cells (liver macrophages) clear bacteria and endotoxins from portal blood.

## Etiology and Pathophysiology (Focus on Hong Kong)

The journey from a healthy liver to cirrhosis follows a common final pathway, regardless of the initial insult: **chronic injury → inflammation → activation of stellate cells → fibrosis → architectural distortion.**

Let's break down the dominant etiologies in HK:

### 1. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) – The Major Player

- **Mechanism:** Chronic HBV infection leads to a persistent, immune-mediated cytotoxic T-cell attack on infected hepatocytes. This causes recurrent cycles of hepatocyte necrosis and regeneration. Over decades, this sustained injury activates HSCs, leading to fibrosis.
- **Direct Oncogenic Effect:** _HBV DNA integrates into the host genome._ The viral protein **HBx** dysregulates cellular signaling pathways (e.g., p53 tumor suppression, Wnt/β-catenin), promoting genetic instability and carcinogenesis. **_This is why HBV-related HCC can occur in a non-cirrhotic liver (in about 20% of cases), unlike HCV where HCC almost always arises on a background of cirrhosis._**
- **Epidemiology in HK:** A chronic HBV carrier has a **20-30% lifetime risk** of developing cirrhosis. The progression is slow, usually taking **10-15 years** of chronic hepatitis.

### 2. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)

- **Mechanism:** Also causes chronic immune-mediated injury. HCV does not integrate into DNA; its carcinogenic effect is almost entirely mediated through the chronic inflammatory milieu of cirrhosis. _Therefore, HCV-related HCC occurs almost exclusively in the setting of established cirrhosis._
- **HK Context:** Less common than HBV, but important.

### 3. Alcohol-Related Liver Disease (ALD)

- **Pathogenesis:** A classic example of toxic injury.
  1.  **Metabolism:** Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in hepatocytes converts ethanol to **acetaldehyde**, a highly toxic and reactive molecule.
  2.  **Acetaldehyde Damage:** Binds to proteins and DNA, forming adducts that promote inflammation, impair mitochondrial function, and generate oxidative stress.
  3.  **Oxidative Stress:** Chronic alcohol use induces cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), which metabolizes ethanol but also produces reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  4.  **Inflammation:** ROS and acetaldehyde damage hepatocytes, release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and activate Kupffer cells. This leads to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6).
  5.  **Stellate Cell Activation:** The cytokine storm and damaged hepatocytes activate HSCs, driving fibrosis. **Alcoholic hepatitis** is an acute-on-chronic flare of intense inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning that accelerates the path to cirrhosis.

### 4. Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) / Steatohepatitis (MASH)

- **The "Two-Hit" Hypothesis (Simplified):**
  1.  **First Hit – Steatosis:** Insulin resistance leads to increased free fatty acid delivery to the liver and increased _de novo_ lipogenesis. The liver becomes fatty (steatosis).
  2.  **Second Hit – Inflammation:** The fatty liver is vulnerable. Lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes generates ROS and lipid peroxides. This causes cellular stress, releases cytokines, and activates HSCs, leading to steatohepatitis (MASH) and fibrosis.
- **Why it matters in HK:** With rising obesity and diabetes, MASLD is now the fastest-growing cause of liver disease worldwide and in Hong Kong.

### 5. Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)

- **Pathogenesis:** An autoimmune disorder targeting the **mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2)** on the inner lining of small intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells.
- **Consequence:** CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells destroy these small ducts (**non-suppurative destructive cholangitis**). Bile cannot flow out (cholestasis). Retained bile acids are toxic to surrounding hepatocytes, causing a "bile infarct" and perpetuating inflammation and fibrosis in the portal tracts, eventually leading to cirrhosis.
- **Classic Serology:** **Anti-Mitochondrial Antibodies (AMA)** are present in ~95% of cases.

<Callout title="Connecting the Dots">
  Every cause of cirrhosis ultimately converges on the **activation of Hepatic
  Stellate Cells (HSCs)**. Whether the trigger is a virus, toxin, fat, or immune
  attack, the result is inflammation and hepatocyte death, which sends signals
  (like TGF-β) to the quiescent, vitamin-A-storing HSC. It transforms,
  proliferates, and becomes a collagen-producing factory, laying down the
  fibrous scar that defines cirrhosis.
</Callout>

## Classification of Cirrhosis

Cirrhosis can be classified in several useful ways:

### 1. By Morphology (Macroscopic Appearance)

- **Micronodular:** Nodules are small and uniform, typically < 3 mm in diameter. Classic of **alcoholic cirrhosis** and **hemochromatosis** in early stages.
- **Macronodular:** Nodules are large and variable in size (>3 mm), separated by broad fibrous bands. Typical of **viral hepatitis-related cirrhosis**.
- **Mixed:** Features of both.

### 2. By Etiology

As detailed above (Viral, Alcoholic, Metabolic, Autoimmune, etc.). This is the most clinically relevant classification as it guides treatment.

### 3. By Clinical Stage (Compensated vs. Decompensated)

_This is the most important classification for prognosis and management._

- **Compensated Cirrhosis:** The liver is scarred but is still able to perform its essential functions. The patient has no overt symptoms or complications. Survival is measured in **years to decades**.
- **Decompensated Cirrhosis:** The liver's synthetic and detoxifying functions fail, and the complications of portal hypertension manifest. Defined by the occurrence of any of the following:
  1.  **Ascites** (most common first decompensating event)
  2.  **Variceal Hemorrhage**
  3.  **Hepatic Encephalopathy**
  4.  **Jaundice due to liver failure**
      Survival drops dramatically to **months to a few years** without transplant.

### 4. By Severity (Child-Pugh & MELD Scores)

These scores quantify the severity of liver dysfunction and are critical for prognostication and transplant listing.

- **Child-Pugh Score:** Uses 5 clinical/lab parameters (Albumin, Bilirubin, INR, Ascites, Encephalopathy). Classes A, B, C.
- **Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) Score:** A more objective, continuous score calculated from **INR, Bilirubin, and Creatinine** (and Sodium for MELD-Na). Used to prioritize patients for liver transplantation.

## Clinical Features

The clinical presentation of cirrhosis is incredibly variable, from completely asymptomatic (compensated) to critically ill with multi-organ failure (decompensated). All features can be traced back to two fundamental pathophysiological derangements: **1) Hepatocellular Dysfunction/Failure** and **2) Portal Hypertension.**

### Symptoms

#### A. Constitutional Symptoms (Non-Specific)

- **Fatigue, Malaise, Weakness:** Extremely common. Likely multifactorial: chronic inflammation, altered neuroendocrine signaling, and possibly low-grade cerebral edema.
- **Anorexia, Weight Loss, Muscle Wasting (Sarcopenia):** Due to:
  - Chronic inflammation (cytokines like TNF-α are catabolic).
  - Altered metabolism and poor nutrient intake.
  - **Sarcopenia** (loss of muscle mass) is a major predictor of poor outcomes in cirrhosis, independent of liver function.
- **Muscle Cramps:** Painful, especially at night. Related to electrolyte imbalances, reduced effective circulatory volume, and peripheral neuropathy.

#### B. Symptoms of Hepatocellular Dysfunction

- **Jaundice:** Yellowing of skin/sclera. Due to the liver's inability to conjugate and excrete bilirubin. _Mechanism:_ As functional hepatocyte mass declines, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia predominates.
- **Dark Urine:** Conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and excreted in urine.
- **Pruritus (Itching):** Particularly prominent in **cholestatic** liver diseases (PBC, PSC). Caused by retained bile acids and other pruritogens (like lysophosphatidic acid) depositing in the skin.
- **Easy Bruising & Bleeding Tendency:**
  - **Synthetic Failure:** Reduced production of clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X, V, XI, XIII, fibrinogen). Factor VII has the shortest half-life (~6 hrs), so an **isolated prolonged PT/INR is often the earliest lab sign** of synthetic dysfunction.
  - **Vitamin K Deficiency:** Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) due to reduced bile salt secretion, which is necessary for their absorption. This further impairs synthesis of Factors II, VII, IX, X.
  - **Thrombocytopenia:** From portal hypertension-induced splenomegaly and hypersplenism (platelet sequestration).
- **Endocrine Disturbances:**
  - **In Men:** **Hypogonadism** (loss of libido, impotence, testicular atrophy), **Gynecomastia**, and a female pattern of hair distribution.
    - _Why?_ The liver fails to metabolize estrogens (increased estradiol) and adrenal androgens (like androstenedione, which is peripherally converted to estrone). There's also suppression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).
  - **In Women:** Menstrual irregularities (oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea), infertility.

#### C. Symptoms of Portal Hypertension & Its Complications

- **Abdominal Distension:** From **ascites** – the accumulation of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Patients feel full, bloated, and their clothes get tight.
- **Lower Limb Edema:** Due to hypoalbuminemia (reduced oncotic pressure) and portal hypertension (increased hydrostatic pressure).
- **Hematemesis/Melena:** Painless, large volume vomiting of blood or black tarry stools is the classic presentation of **acute variceal hemorrhage** from ruptured esophageal or gastric varices. A life-threatening emergency.
- **Confusion, Altered Mental Status, Sleep Disturbance:** Symptoms of **hepatic encephalopathy**. Ranges from subtle sleep reversal and poor concentration (minimal HE) to coma (overt HE). Caused by the failure of the liver to detoxify gut-derived neurotoxins, especially **ammonia**.

### Signs (Physical Examination)

#### General Examination (Stigmata of Chronic Liver Disease)

These are clues that hint at long-standing liver dysfunction.

- **Jaundice:** Scleral icterus, yellow skin.
- **Excoriations:** Scratch marks from pruritus.
- **Spider Angiomata (Nevi):** Central arteriole with radiating small vessels, found on the face, neck, and upper trunk. Due to increased estrogen causing vasodilation. _Not specific but highly suggestive._
- **Palmar Erythema:** Reddening of the thenar and hypothenar eminences. Also estrogen-mediated vasodilation.
- **Dupuytren's Contracture:** Thickening and shortening of palmar fascia, causing finger flexion. Classically associated with alcoholism.
- **Xanthelasma:** Yellow cholesterol deposits around eyes. Seen in cholestatic diseases like PBC.
- **Parotid Enlargement:** Associated with alcoholic liver disease.
- **Gynecomastia & Testicular Atrophy:** As described above.
- **Sarcopenia/Muscle Wasting:** Prominent clavicles, temporal wasting.

#### Abdominal Examination

- **Inspection:**
  - **Distension:** From ascites.
  - **Caput Medusae:** Dilated veins radiating from the umbilicus. Rare but pathognomonic for portal hypertension. Due to recanalization of the umbilical vein (part of the falciform ligament) shunting blood to the abdominal wall veins.
  - **Visible peristalsis/hernias:** Due to increased intra-abdominal pressure from ascites (umbilical, inguinal, incisional).
- **Palpation:**
  - **Liver:** Can be **enlarged, normal-sized, or shrunken**.
    - _Viral cirrhosis (HBV/HCV)_ often leads to a **small, firm, nodular, non-tender** liver.
    - _Alcoholic and cardiac cirrhosis_ may present with a **large, firm liver**.
  - **Spleen:** **Splenomegaly** is a cardinal sign of portal hypertension. The enlarged spleen sequesters platelets and white cells, contributing to thrombocytopenia and leukopenia (**hypersplenism**).
- **Percussion:**
  - **Shifting Dullness** or **Fluid Thrill:** To confirm the presence of ascites.
- **Auscultation:**
  - **Bruit over the liver:** Uncommon, but if present, think of **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)** (tumor vascularity) or alcoholic hepatitis.

#### Other Systemic Signs

- **Fetor Hepaticus:** A sweet, musty breath odor due to exhaled volatile sulfur compounds (e.g., mercaptans) from gut bacteria, which the failing liver cannot metabolize.
- **Asterixis ("Liver Flap"):** A negative myoclonus – a brief, involuntary loss of postural tone causing a flapping tremor of the wrists when extended. A classic sign of **hepatic encephalopathy**. Caused by disrupted neuronal metabolism in the brain.
- **Peripheral Edema:** Pitting edema in the lower limbs.
