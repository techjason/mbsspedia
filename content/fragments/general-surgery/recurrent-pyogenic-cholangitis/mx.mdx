## Management of Recurrent Pyogenic Cholangitis

The management of RPC must be understood in two distinct phases, because the disease has two faces:

1. **Acute phase**: Treat the cholangitis flare — this is an emergency
2. **Long-term phase**: Break the vicious cycle of stasis → infection → stones → strictures → more stasis — this requires definitive intervention

The fundamental principle is that you **cannot cure RPC with antibiotics alone**. Why? Because the underlying problem is **mechanical** — strictures and stones cause obstruction and stasis, and antibiotics cannot clear stones or open strictures. Furthermore, ***excretion of antibiotics is impaired in biliary obstruction*** [15][16] — the very antibiotics you give cannot reach therapeutic concentrations in the obstructed bile, making ***biliary drainage mandatory*** [16].

## Phase 1: Acute Management — "RAD"

The mnemonic ***RAD*** captures the three pillars of acute cholangitis management [7]:

> ***R = Resuscitation, A = Antibiotics, D = Drainage*** — ***must know!*** [7]

### 1. Resuscitation

| Component | Detail | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| ***NPO (Nil per os)*** | Keep patient fasting | Reduces biliary stimulation (CCK release → gallbladder contraction → increased biliary pressure); prepares for potential emergency ERCP |
| ***IV fluids*** | Aggressive crystalloid resuscitation (e.g., Ringer's lactate / normal saline) | Biliary sepsis → vasodilatation + third-spacing → intravascular volume depletion → organ hypoperfusion. Fluids restore circulating volume |
| ***Monitor vitals and I/O Q1h*** [7] | Continuous monitoring of temperature, pulse, BP, consciousness level, urine output [6] | Detects signs of **failure of conservative treatment**: ↑ temperature/pulse, ↓ BP/consciousness/urine output, increased abdominal tenderness and guarding [6] |
| **Correct coagulopathy** | IV Vitamin K (phytomenadione 10 mg slow IV) | Obstructive jaundice → impaired fat-soluble vitamin absorption → Vitamin K deficiency → coagulopathy. Must correct before any invasive procedure |

<Callout title="Why Monitor So Closely?">
***15% of patients will NOT respond to antibiotics*** and will require emergency biliary decompression [6]. You need to catch this deterioration early. The signs of failure include rising temperature, tachycardia, falling BP, falling urine output, worsening tenderness, and altered consciousness — essentially progression towards Reynold's pentad.
</Callout>

### 2. Antibiotics

#### Principles of Antibiotic Selection

The empirical regimen must cover the organisms that cause RPC cholangitis: **Gram-negative aerobes** (E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas) **and anaerobes** (Bacteroides) [1][6].

Why not just one antibiotic? Because the bile duct in RPC harbours a polymicrobial environment, and inadequate coverage leads to treatment failure and fulminant sepsis.

#### Empirical Antibiotic Regimens

| Regimen | Coverage | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| ***IV Cefuroxime + Metronidazole*** [15] | Cefuroxime: Gram-negative aerobes; Metronidazole: anaerobes | Standard HK regimen for mild–moderate disease |
| ***IV Piperacillin-Tazobactam (Tazocin)*** [7][15] | Broad-spectrum: Gram-negatives including Pseudomonas + anaerobes | ***Severe disease*** or Reynold's pentad |
| IV Ampicillin-Sulbactam (Augmentin) | Gram-negatives + anaerobes | ***Mild disease*** [7] |
| IV Metronidazole + 3rd-gen cephalosporin (e.g., Ceftriaxone) [6] | Ceftriaxone: Gram-negatives; Metronidazole: anaerobes | Alternative regimen |
| IV Metronidazole + Fluoroquinolone (e.g., Ciprofloxacin/Levofloxacin) [6] | Fluoroquinolone: Gram-negatives; Metronidazole: anaerobes | Penicillin allergy |

**Duration**: Typically ***7 days*** of IV antibiotics [7], then step down to oral based on culture and sensitivity results.

<Callout title="Why Antibiotics Alone Are Not Enough">
***Biliary obstruction impairs the excretion of antibiotics into bile*** [16]. Normal biliary pressure is 7–14 cm H₂O. When pressure rises > 25 cm H₂O (due to obstruction), ***bacteria reflux into hepatic veins and lymphatics → bacteraemia and septic shock*** [16]. Even high-dose IV antibiotics cannot achieve adequate biliary concentrations when the duct is obstructed. This is why ***biliary drainage is mandatory*** [16] — you must physically decompress the system.
</Callout>

#### Targeted Antibiotic Therapy
- Adjust based on ***blood/bile culture and sensitivity*** results
- If ***Clonorchis sinensis*** identified on stool O&P: add ***praziquantel 25 mg/kg PO TDS × 1 day*** [3]

### 3. Drainage — The Critical Step

***Biliary drainage is the definitive acute intervention*** — it addresses the mechanical obstruction that antibiotics cannot fix [16].

#### Indications for Urgent Drainage [7]

- ***Reynold's pentad*** (Charcot's triad + shock + altered mental status)
- ***Not responding to antibiotics for 24 hours*** [7]
  - Why 24 hours? Because obstruction impairs antibiotic secretion into bile — if there's no improvement in 24h, it means the obstruction is not resolving spontaneously and drainage is mandatory

#### Drainage Modalities — Stepwise Escalation

The QMH (Queen Mary Hospital) stepwise approach [6]:

> ***QMH practice: ERCP → PTBD → ECBD*** [6]

---

#### 3A. ERCP — First-Line Drainage

***ERCP is the first-line approach for biliary drainage in acute cholangitis*** [6][7][15].

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Procedure** | Endoscope to D2 → cannulate ampulla → aspirate bile/pus → inject contrast → visualise obstruction → intervene |
| ***Role in acute setting*** | ***Biliary drainage and decompression in unstable patients — NOT stone removal*** [7] |
| **Step 1** | ***Aspirate bile duct*** to remove bile and pus → decompress → reduces risk of bacteraemia during contrast injection [7] |
| **Step 2** | Inject contrast → delineate anatomy |
| **Step 3** | Place ***plastic stent*** (temporary, requires scheduled change) with or without ***sphincterotomy*** [7] |
| **Step 4** | ***Remove stone now or interval ERCP*** after sepsis resolves [7] |
| **Mortality** | ***< 5%*** [7] |

##### ERCP Procedures in Detail

**a) Endoscopic Sphincterotomy** [6]

- **What**: Electrocautery incision through the musculature of the biliary portion of the Sphincter of Oddi
- **Why**: Eliminates the principal anatomic barrier impeding stone passage; facilitates stone extraction; allows future access
- **Complications**:
  - ***Short-term***: Acute pancreatitis, ***perforation*** (intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal), bleeding from papillotomy, infection [6][15]
    - ***Intraperitoneal perforation***: Perforate the duodenum → free gas under diaphragm on CXR → **requires operative treatment** (will not seal spontaneously) [6]
    - ***Retroperitoneal perforation***: Perforate the bile duct when cutting the ampulla (retroperitoneal portion of D2) → **no free gas** under diaphragm → retroperitoneal gas may be present → **conservative treatment** (will seal spontaneously) [6]
  - ***Long-term***: Acute cholangitis recurrence, stone recurrence, papillary stenosis [6]

**b) Stricture Balloon Dilatation** [1]

- Balloon inflated across stricture to widen the lumen
- Important in RPC because strictures are the primary mechanical problem

**c) Biliary Stent Placement** [1]

- ***Plastic stent*** (temporary) — requires scheduled exchange (every 3 months typically, as plastic stents occlude with biofilm/sludge)
- Purpose: maintains biliary drainage through the strictured segment
- ***Initial biliary decompression is achieved by ERCP with sphincterotomy, stricture dilatation and placement of biliary endoprosthesis (stent) often required*** [1]

**d) Stone Extraction Methods** [15]

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| **Wire basket** (Dormia basket) | Wire cage deployed around stone → trapped → extracted through sphincterotomy |
| **Stone extraction balloon** | Balloon inflated above stone → swept downward through sphincterotomy |
| **Mechanical lithotripsy** | For large stones → mechanical crushing within the duct |

##### Challenges of ERCP in RPC [1]

***Endoscopic intervention is challenging due to multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic stones as well as stricturing*** [1]. Key issues:
- ERCP accesses from below (retrograde) → **limited access to intrahepatic ducts** above tight strictures
- ***ERCP difficult to access intrahepatic drainage*** [2] — the disease in RPC is predominantly intrahepatic
- Multiple strictures may prevent passage of the scope or instruments
- ***Patients in whom adequate drainage cannot be achieved during ERCP will require percutaneous or surgical drainage*** [1]

##### Relative Contraindications for ERCP [15]

***Altered GI anatomy e.g. Billroth II gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y*** [15] — the altered anatomy makes cannulation of the ampulla technically very difficult or impossible.

---

#### 3B. PTBD — Second-Line Drainage

***PTBD is indicated when ERCP is unsuccessful, unavailable, or contraindicated*** [6][7].

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Technique** | Percutaneous needle through liver parenchyma → puncture dilated intrahepatic duct under USG/fluoroscopic guidance → confirm position with contrast → insert guidewire → catheter placement [6] |
| **Access route** | Usually via ***left hepatic duct*** (preferred — subcostal approach is less painful than intercostal for right duct; less likely to transgress pleural space) or right hepatic duct; can also access through gallbladder puncture [6] |
| ***Key advantage for RPC*** | ***Transhepatic insertion directly into intrahepatic bile ducts*** — directly accesses the intrahepatic disease that ERCP cannot reach [7] |
| **Therapeutic capabilities** | Drainage of infected bile; extraction of biliary stones; dilatation of benign strictures; stent placement across strictures [6] |
| ***Efficacy*** | ***Similar efficacy and rate of complications as ERCP*** [7] |
| **Output monitoring** | ***Easy output monitoring — external drainage*** [7], but can be internalised later (external-internal PTBD) |
| **Complications** | ***Bacteraemia*** (antibiotic prophylaxis required); ***haemobilia*** (puncture of hepatic artery or portal vein); bile leak; pneumothorax [6][14] |
| **Disadvantages** | ***Risk of fluid and electrolyte loss*** (external bile drainage) [7]; patient discomfort from external catheter; requires patent intrahepatic duct dilatation for safe access |

> The reason PTBD is particularly useful in RPC compared to simple choledocholithiasis is that the disease is in the **intrahepatic ducts**, and PTBD goes directly to the problem. ERCP approaches from below and is limited by strictures blocking retrograde access.

---

#### 3C. Surgical Drainage — Third-Line (Last Resort)

***Surgical drainage for acute cholangitis is reserved for patients in whom other methods of biliary drainage cannot be performed or have failed*** [6].

| Procedure | Detail |
|---|---|
| ***Exploration of Common Bile Duct (ECBD)*** | Open (emergency) or laparoscopic (selected elective cases) → choledochotomy → stone removal → T-tube placement for ongoing drainage and future cholangiography [6][15] |
| ***Indications*** | ***Failure of endoscopic drainage; deterioration despite endoscopic drainage*** [15] |
| **T-tube** | Placed in CBD after exploration → provides ongoing bile drainage → allows subsequent cholangiogram to check for residual stones |
| ***Mortality*** | ***~30%*** [7] — this is why surgery is the last resort for acute cholangitis |
| **Approach** | ***Open approach for emergency case; laparoscopic approach in selected elective case*** [15] |

<Callout title="Why Is Surgical Drainage So Dangerous?" type="error">
The ***high mortality (~30%)*** of surgical CBD exploration in acute cholangitis [7] is because these patients are already septic, often with organ dysfunction (Grade III severity). General anaesthesia in a septic patient compounds haemodynamic instability. The combination of sepsis + surgical stress + coagulopathy (Vitamin K deficiency from obstruction) + impaired wound healing (from cholestasis-related protein synthesis impairment) makes operative mortality very high. This is why the stepwise escalation ***ERCP → PTBD → surgery*** is so important — exhaust less invasive options first.
</Callout>

---

### Other Acute Drainage Options

| Modality | Role |
|---|---|
| ***T-tube drainage*** | Can be placed during ECBD or through a mature PTBD tract; allows ongoing external drainage and access for cholangiography [2] |
| ***Hepaticocutaneojejunostomy (HCJ)*** | A surgical technique creating a conduit from intrahepatic bile ducts through a Roux-en-Y jejunal loop to the skin surface — allows future percutaneous access for repeat stone clearance without needing ERCP [2]. Used in complex RPC with recurrent stone formation |
| ***Therapeutic EUS (EUS-guided cholangiopancreatography)*** | Alternative when ERCP fails — EUS-guided puncture of bile duct from duodenum/stomach → guidewire → stent [7] |

---

## Phase 2: Long-Term / Definitive Management

Once the acute episode is controlled, the focus shifts to ***breaking the vicious cycle*** and ***preventing long-term complications*** (cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma).

### A. Regular Ductal Clearance (Non-Operative)

| Strategy | Detail | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| ***USG surveillance*** | Regular interval ultrasound (e.g., every 6–12 months) [2] | Monitor for stone recurrence, new strictures, hepatic atrophy, suspicious masses (cholangioCA) |
| ***Interval ERCP*** | Scheduled ERCP sessions to ***remove stones and dilate strictures*** [2] | Reduces stone burden and relieves obstruction — breaks the stasis → infection → stone cycle |
| **Percutaneous choledochoscopy** | Through a mature PTBD or HCJ tract → direct visualisation and stone extraction | Allows repeated access to intrahepatic ducts for clearance without repeated ERCP |

### B. Hepatobiliary Resection + Biliary-Enteric Anastomosis (Definitive Surgery)

This is the ***cornerstone of definitive management*** for RPC when disease is localised and the non-operative approach fails or complications arise [1][2].

#### Indications for Surgical Resection [2]

| Indication | Rationale |
|---|---|
| ***Atrophic liver segment*** | The segment is non-functional, harbours stones and strictures, and serves as a persistent source of infection. Removing it eliminates the diseased reservoir [2] |
| ***Failed non-operative treatment*** | Recurrent cholangitis despite regular ERCP/PTBD stone clearance → the strictures and stones are too extensive for endoscopic management alone [2] |
| ***Suspected cholangiocarcinoma*** | Chronic inflammation → dysplasia → carcinoma. Resection is both diagnostic and therapeutic — removes the at-risk tissue [2] |

#### Surgical Procedures

**a) Hepatobiliary Resection** [1]

- ***Resection of the hepatobiliary segments with the aim to resect areas of recurrent infection, biliary stasis and hepatic atrophy*** [1]
- Typically involves **left hepatectomy** (or left lateral sectionectomy) given the left lobe predilection of RPC
- May involve segmentectomy if disease is more localised
- Removes the entire diseased segment — strictures, stones, atrophic parenchyma, and potential pre-malignant tissue

**b) Biliary-Enteric Anastomosis** [1]

| Procedure | Description | Role in RPC |
|---|---|---|
| ***Hepaticojejunostomy (HJ)*** | Anastomosis of the hepatic duct to a Roux-en-Y jejunal loop | ***Frequently required*** in RPC [1] — provides wide drainage of the remaining biliary tree into the jejunum, bypassing any residual extrahepatic strictures |
| Choledochoduodenostomy | Anastomosis of CBD to duodenum | ***Contraindicated in RPC*** — residual strictured biliary segments may not be drained adequately [1] |
| Choledochojejunostomy | Anastomosis of CBD to jejunum | ***Also contraindicated in RPC*** — same reason; does not address intrahepatic disease above the anastomosis [1] |

<Callout title="Why Hepaticojejunostomy and NOT Choledochoduodenostomy/Choledochojejunostomy?">
***Standard biliary drainage procedures such as choledochoduodenostomy or choledochojejunostomy are contraindicated in RPC since residual strictured biliary segments may not be drained adequately*** [1]. The problem in RPC is **intrahepatic** — connecting the CBD to the bowel does nothing for strictured intrahepatic segments above the anastomosis. Hepaticojejunostomy connects at a **higher level** (at the hepatic duct), and when combined with resection of the diseased segments, ensures that the remaining healthy biliary tree drains adequately.
</Callout>

**c) Hepaticocutaneojejunostomy (HCJ)** [2]

- A specialised procedure where a Roux-en-Y jejunal loop is brought to the skin (subcutaneous) as a future access loop
- Purpose: allows ***repeated percutaneous access*** for choledochoscopy and stone clearance through the subcutaneous loop without needing ERCP or reoperation
- Particularly useful in patients with diffuse bilateral disease where complete resection is not possible but ongoing stone clearance is needed

### C. Anti-Parasitic Treatment

| Condition | Treatment | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| ***Clonorchis sinensis infection*** | ***Praziquantel 25 mg/kg PO TDS × 1 day*** [3] | Eliminates the parasitic trigger that initiated and perpetuates epithelial damage → breaks the vicious cycle at its origin |

### D. Nutritional Support

| Intervention | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Adequate protein intake** | Low-protein diet was the historical risk factor → relative enzyme deficiency → promotes stone formation. Improving nutrition may reduce stone recurrence |
| **Fat-soluble vitamin supplementation** (A, D, E, K) | Chronic biliary obstruction → malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin K specifically to prevent coagulopathy |

---

## Management Summary by Phase

| Phase | Priorities | Key Interventions |
|---|---|---|
| ***Acute (RAD)*** | Control sepsis, relieve obstruction | ***Resuscitation*** (NPO, IV fluids, monitoring); ***Antibiotics*** (Augmentin/Tazocin/Cefuroxime+Metro); ***Drainage*** (ERCP → PTBD → ECBD) [6][7] |
| **Subacute (post-sepsis)** | Complete stone clearance, map disease extent | Interval ERCP for stone removal; CT/MRCP for surgical planning; stool O&P; anti-parasitic Rx |
| ***Long-term (definitive)*** | Break the vicious cycle, prevent complications | ***Regular ductal clearance*** (USG surveillance + ERCP) [2]; ***Hepatobiliary resection + HJ*** if indicated [1][2]; anti-parasitic treatment |
| **Surveillance** | Detect cholangiocarcinoma early | Regular USG; serial CA 19-9 if indicated; low threshold for CT/MRI if new symptoms |

---

## Special Considerations

### Monitoring for Treatment Failure [6]

During the acute phase, continuously monitor for signs that conservative treatment is failing:

| Sign | Implication |
|---|---|
| ***↑ Temperature / Pulse*** | Worsening sepsis |
| ***↓ BP / Consciousness / Urine output*** | Progression to septic shock (Reynold's pentad) |
| ***Increased abdominal tenderness and guarding*** | Potential biliary perforation, peritonitis, or liver abscess formation |

> ***Definitive treatment should be deferred until cholangitis has been treated and the proper diagnosis is established*** [6]. Never rush to definitive surgery during acute sepsis — stabilise first.

### Post-ERCP Complications to Watch For [15]

| Complication | Presentation | Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Post-ERCP fever and tachycardia** | DDx: persistent cholangitis (unsuccessful drainage, migrated/blocked stent, resistant organisms), flare-up sepsis, pancreatitis, perforation [15] | AXR (stent position), repeat imaging, consider re-intervention |
| **Post-ERCP abdominal pain** | DDx: post-ERCP pancreatitis (elevated amylase/lipase), perforation | ***CT abdomen (retroperitoneal free gas)*** [15]; conservative vs surgical management depending on type |

### Stent-Related Issues

| Issue | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Stent occlusion** | Sludge, biofilm, tumour ingrowth (metallic stents) → recurrent cholangitis → requires stent exchange |
| **Stent migration** | Stent displaces distally into duodenum or proximally into duct → loss of drainage → recurrent symptoms |
| ***Patients with indwelling stents and cholangitis*** | ***Usually require repeated imaging and stent removal and replacement*** [6] |

---

## Comparison: Drainage Modalities

| Feature | ERCP | PTBD | ECBD (Surgical) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Access** | Retrograde (from duodenum) | Antegrade (percutaneous through liver) | Direct (open abdomen) |
| **Best for** | CBD/extrahepatic stones | ***Intrahepatic obstruction*** (above confluence) | Failure of both ERCP and PTBD |
| **Therapeutic capability** | Sphincterotomy, stone removal, stent | Drainage, stent, stone removal | Complete exploration + T-tube |
| ***RPC-specific limitation*** | ***Difficult intrahepatic access*** [1][2] | Requires dilated ducts for safe puncture | High mortality (~30%) [7] |
| ***Relative C/I*** | ***Altered GI anatomy (Billroth II, Roux-en-Y)*** [15] | Coagulopathy, ascites, non-dilated ducts | Haemodynamic instability |
| **Mortality** | < 5% [7] | Similar to ERCP [7] | ~30% [7] |

---

## Treatment of Underlying Cause — Cholangitis From Biliary Obstruction (From First Principles)

To truly understand why this management works, recall the pathophysiology from the lecture slides [16]:

> ***Normal ductal pressure: 7–14 cm H₂O. Increased biliary pressure > 25 cm H₂O → bacteria reflux to hepatic veins and lymphatics → bacteraemia and septic shock. Excretion of antibiotics impaired in biliary obstruction. Biliary drainage is mandatory.*** [16]

This explains everything:
1. **Why antibiotics alone fail**: They cannot be excreted into bile when the ducts are obstructed → cannot achieve therapeutic concentrations at the site of infection
2. **Why drainage is mandatory**: Must physically reduce biliary pressure below 25 cm H₂O → stops bacterial reflux into the bloodstream → allows antibiotics to work
3. **Why decompression is urgent in Reynold's pentad**: The patient already has bacteraemia and septic shock → every hour of delay worsens outcomes

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Management of RPC">

1. ***Acute management = RAD***: ***Resuscitation*** (NPO, IV fluids, monitor Q1h) → ***Antibiotics*** (Augmentin for mild / Tazocin for severe / Cefuroxime + Metronidazole × 7 days) → ***Drainage*** (urgent if Reynold's pentad or no response to antibiotics in 24h)

2. ***QMH drainage escalation***: ***ERCP → PTBD → ECBD*** (surgical exploration has ~30% mortality — last resort)

3. **ERCP role in acute setting**: ***Biliary drainage and decompression — NOT stone removal***. Aspirate pus/bile first, then contrast, then plastic stent

4. ***PTBD preferred when intrahepatic obstruction*** — directly accesses intrahepatic ducts that ERCP cannot reach

5. ***Biliary drainage is mandatory*** because ***antibiotic excretion is impaired in biliary obstruction*** and biliary pressure > 25 cm H₂O causes bacteraemia

6. ***15% of patients will NOT respond to antibiotics*** → need emergency drainage

7. **Definitive surgery**: ***Hepatobiliary resection + hepaticojejunostomy*** — indications: atrophic segment, failed non-op Tx, suspected cholangioCA

8. ***Choledochoduodenostomy and choledochojejunostomy are CONTRAINDICATED*** in RPC because residual strictured segments are not drained adequately

9. ***Definitive treatment deferred until cholangitis resolved*** — never operate on a septic patient for definitive surgery

10. **Anti-parasitic**: ***Praziquantel 25 mg/kg TDS × 1 day*** for Clonorchis sinensis

11. **Long-term**: ***Regular ductal clearance*** (USG surveillance + interval ERCP); HCJ for repeated percutaneous access
