## Diagnostic Criteria for Acute Cholangitis (Applied to RPC)

There is no standalone "diagnostic criteria" set for RPC per se — instead, the diagnosis of an **acute RPC flare** uses the diagnostic criteria for **acute cholangitis** (based on the Tokyo Guidelines, TG18/TG13), combined with imaging findings that are characteristic of the underlying RPC disease pattern. Think of it in two layers:

1. **Layer 1**: Is this acute cholangitis? → Apply the Tokyo Guidelines criteria
2. **Layer 2**: Is the underlying cause RPC? → Look for the characteristic imaging triad of **intrahepatic stones + intrahepatic strictures + left lobe predilection**

---

### Tokyo Guidelines Diagnostic Criteria for Acute Cholangitis [6][7]

These criteria apply to any acute cholangitis episode, including those caused by RPC.

#### Suspected Diagnosis

The patient must have **BOTH** of the following [6]:

| Criterion A (Systemic inflammation) | Criterion B (Cholestasis/biliary injury) |
|---|---|
| **ONE** of: Fever or shaking chills **OR** Laboratory evidence of inflammatory response (abnormal WBC, ↑ CRP, or other inflammatory markers) | **ONE** of: Jaundice **OR** Abnormal liver chemistries (↑ AST/ALT/ALP/GGT) |

#### Definite Diagnosis

In addition to meeting criteria for suspected diagnosis, the patient must have **BOTH** of the following [6]:

| Criterion C (Biliary dilatation) | Criterion D (Etiology identified) |
|---|---|
| Biliary dilatation on imaging | Evidence of an etiology on imaging: **stone, stricture, or stent** |

<Callout title="Applying TG18 to RPC">
In RPC, the "definite diagnosis" criteria are almost always met during acute flares because imaging shows both **biliary dilatation** (from stricture-induced obstruction) and the **etiology** (intrahepatic stones and strictures). The challenge is not whether the patient has cholangitis — it's recognising that the **underlying pattern** is RPC rather than simple choledocholithiasis. This requires careful imaging interpretation.
</Callout>

#### Severity Grading (TG18) — Important for Guiding Urgency of Drainage

| Grade | Criteria | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **Grade I (Mild)** | Does not meet criteria for Grade II or III; responds to initial antibiotic therapy | Conservative management |
| **Grade II (Moderate)** | Any 2 of: WBC > 12 or < 4 ×10⁹/L, fever ≥ 39°C, age ≥ 75, bilirubin ≥ 85 μmol/L (5 mg/dL), albumin < 0.7× lower limit of normal | Early biliary drainage recommended |
| ***Grade III (Severe)*** | Organ dysfunction in any ONE system: cardiovascular (hypotension requiring vasopressors), neurological (altered consciousness), respiratory, renal (oliguria, Cr > 176 μmol/L), hepatic (PT-INR > 1.5), haematological (platelets < 100 ×10⁹/L) | ***Urgent biliary drainage*** — this is Reynold's pentad territory [6][7] |

> ***Reynold's pentad*** (Charcot's triad + shock + altered mental status) corresponds to Grade III severity and requires **emergent biliary drainage** — delay leads to multiorgan failure and death [6][7].

---

### Diagnostic Features Specific to RPC (Layer 2)

Once acute cholangitis is confirmed, the following features on investigation point specifically to RPC rather than other causes [1][2]:

| Feature | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Intrahepatic stones** (not just CBD stones) | Stones formed de novo within intrahepatic ducts — pathognomonic |
| **Intrahepatic biliary strictures** with proximal dilatation | Fibrotic narrowing from repeated infection-healing cycles |
| ***Central dilated bile ducts with peripheral tapering*** | Classic CT finding — central ducts dilated, peripheral ducts narrowed by strictures [2] |
| ***Left lobe predilection*** | Due to anatomical drainage angle promoting stasis [2] |
| **Hepatic atrophy** (usually left lobe) | Chronic obstruction and parenchymal destruction [2] |
| **Absence of gallbladder stones** (typically) | Stones form in ducts, not gallbladder — distinguishes from choledocholithiasis |
| ***Brown pigment stones*** (on ERCP/choledochoscopy) | Soft, earthy, calcium bilirubinate — not cholesterol |
| **Recurrent history** | 1–2 episodes per year over many years [2] |
| **Southeast Asian ethnicity** | Strong geographic predilection [1] |

---

## Diagnostic Algorithm

### Overall Approach

The diagnostic workup of a suspected RPC flare follows a logical stepwise approach: **clinical assessment → bloods → initial imaging (USG) → advanced imaging (CT/MRCP) → cholangiography (ERCP/PTC) if therapeutic intervention needed** [1][2][6][7][14].

## Investigation Modalities — Detailed Breakdown

### A. Bedside and Physical Examination

Before any bloods or imaging, the clinical examination itself provides crucial information:

| Finding | Significance | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Charcot's triad** (fever + RUQ pain + jaundice) | Strongly suggests acute cholangitis [6] | Infection + obstruction + biliary backflow |
| **Reynold's pentad** (+ shock + confusion) | ***Grade III severity — needs urgent drainage*** [6][7] | Sepsis → endotoxaemia → cardiovascular collapse + encephalopathy |
| **Palpable gallbladder** | Exception to Courvoisier's law — suggests RPC (not chronic cholecystitis) [4] | Gallbladder not fibrosed (disease is in ducts) → can distend with CBD obstruction |
| **Hepatomegaly** | Intrahepatic ductal dilatation; may also indicate abscess | Biliary obstruction → back-pressure → liver swelling |
| **Signs of chronic liver disease** | Suggests secondary biliary cirrhosis (advanced RPC) | Chronic biliary obstruction → progressive fibrosis |

---

### B. Laboratory Investigations

#### B1. Blood Tests

| Test | Expected Findings in RPC | Why This Test? (Pathophysiological Rationale) |
|---|---|---|
| ***CBC with differentials*** | ***Leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance*** [6][14] | Bacterial infection → bone marrow releases neutrophils → left shift. Thrombocytopenia if sepsis-associated DIC or hypersplenism from cirrhosis |
| **CRP / ESR** | ***↑ ESR and CRP*** [6] | Acute phase reactants produced by the liver in response to IL-6; CRP useful for monitoring treatment response |
| ***LFT*** | ***↑ ALP and GGT (cholestatic pattern)***; ***↑ conjugated bilirubin***; mild ↑ AST/ALT [6][14] | **ALP and GGT** are enzymes concentrated in the biliary epithelium — obstruction causes back-pressure and induction of these enzymes. **Conjugated bilirubin** rises because it is synthesised but cannot be excreted past the obstruction. AST/ALT may be mildly elevated from hepatocellular injury secondary to cholestasis |
| **RFT** | May show ↑ creatinine in severe cases | Renal impairment from sepsis (hepatorenal syndrome in cirrhotic patients) or direct nephrotoxicity from cholestasis |
| ***Clotting profile*** | ***Coagulopathy*** (prolonged PT/INR) [4][14] | **Why?** Bile cannot reach the intestine → cannot emulsify fats → cannot absorb fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, ***K***) → Vitamin K is a co-factor for factors II, VII, IX, X → deficiency causes prolonged PT. This is critical to check **before any invasive procedure** like ERCP or PTBD |
| ***Blood culture*** (×2 sets BEFORE antibiotics) | May grow E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas [7] | ***Blood culture is essential*** — guides targeted antibiotic therapy. Take before starting empirical antibiotics. Positive bile cultures are common with bile duct stones and other causes of obstruction [6] |
| **Amylase / Lipase** | Usually normal; elevated if concurrent pancreatitis | Rule out biliary pancreatitis (stone at ampulla → pancreatic duct obstruction) [7] |
| ***Stool for ova and parasites*** | May detect Clonorchis sinensis eggs [2][3] | Identifies the parasitic trigger — important for targeted treatment (praziquantel) and epidemiological understanding |

<Callout title="The Cholestatic Pattern — Explained from First Principles" type="idea">
**Why ALP and GGT rise more than AST/ALT in biliary obstruction:**
- ALP (alkaline phosphatase) is an enzyme found on the **canalicular surface** of hepatocytes (the bile duct-facing surface). When bile backs up, this membrane is disrupted → ALP leaks into blood. Additionally, bile acids that accumulate act as detergents that solubilise ALP from the membrane.
- GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) is concentrated in the **biliary epithelium** itself. Obstruction → epithelial damage → GGT release. GGT is also induced by bile acids.
- AST/ALT are **cytoplasmic enzymes of hepatocytes** — they rise primarily with hepatocellular damage (e.g., hepatitis). In cholestasis, the hepatocyte itself is not the primary target, so these rise only mildly from secondary back-pressure injury.
- **Conjugated (direct) bilirubin** rises because the hepatocyte conjugates bilirubin normally, but the conjugated product cannot be excreted through the obstructed ducts → refluxes back into the bloodstream → conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.
</Callout>

#### B2. Tumour Markers (When Cholangiocarcinoma is Suspected)

| Marker | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| ***CEA and CA 19-9*** | ***May or may not be elevated; nonspecific*** [5][14] | These markers lack sensitivity and specificity for cholangiocarcinoma. However, in an RPC patient, a **rising CA 19-9** over serial measurements should raise alarm for superimposed malignancy |
| ***Serial assay after resection*** | ***Might aid in diagnosis of persistent or recurrent disease*** [14] |

<Callout title="Tumour Markers — NOT for Screening" type="error">
***CEA and CA 19-9 are NOT useful as screening tools for malignant biliary obstruction*** [14]. They are neither sensitive nor specific. The absence of an elevated tumour marker does NOT exclude underlying malignancy [14]. Their role is in **serial monitoring** after resection to detect recurrence.
</Callout>

#### B3. Urinalysis

| Finding | Significance |
|---|---|
| **Bile in urine (conjugated bilirubin)** | Conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble → filtered by kidneys when serum levels rise → bilirubinuria → dark "tea-coloured" urine. Confirms obstructive (post-hepatic) jaundice [6] |
| **Absent urobilinogen** | No bilirubin reaching the gut → no urobilinogen produced → none reabsorbed → absent in urine. Helps distinguish obstructive from hepatocellular jaundice |

---

### C. Imaging Investigations

This is the cornerstone of RPC diagnosis. The goals of imaging are:

1. **Confirm biliary obstruction** (dilatation)
2. **Identify the cause** (stones, strictures)
3. **Map the extent of disease** (which segments affected, atrophy)
4. **Detect complications** (abscess, cholangiocarcinoma)
5. **Plan intervention** (drainage route, surgical resection)

#### C1. Transabdominal Ultrasound (USG) — First-Line Imaging

***USG is the initial imaging modality*** for any patient with suspected biliary disease [1][2][7].

| Finding | Description | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Dilated intrahepatic ducts*** | Parallel channel sign (dilated duct running alongside portal vein branches); intrahepatic ducts normally < 2–3 mm and not visible on USG [14] | Confirms biliary obstruction |
| ***Intrahepatic stones*** | Hyperechoic foci within dilated ducts ± posterior acoustic shadowing | Direct visualisation of RPC stones; brown pigment stones may be less echogenic than cholesterol stones |
| ***Liver abscess*** | Hypoechoic or complex cystic lesion within liver parenchyma | Complication of RPC — must rule out [1][2] |
| **Gallbladder** | Usually normal (no stones, no wall thickening) | Helps distinguish from cholecystitis/choledocholithiasis |
| **CBD dilatation** | CBD > 8 mm (or > 0.1 cm per decade of age) [14] | May be present if extrahepatic component exists |

**Limitations of USG**:
- **Distal CBD often obscured by bowel gas** [14] — cannot reliably see ampullary pathology
- May miss small intrahepatic stones
- Operator-dependent
- **Acute obstruction** — duct may not yet have time to dilate → false negative [6]

#### C2. CT Abdomen (with Contrast) — Second-Line / Staging

CT provides more anatomical detail than USG and is critical for **surgical planning** and **complication detection** [1][2].

| Finding | Description | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Central dilated bile ducts with peripheral tapering*** | Dilated central intrahepatic ducts that narrow peripherally due to strictures | ***Classic CT finding of RPC*** [2] — the strictures are peripheral, so central ducts dilate while peripheral ducts are narrowed |
| ***Left lobe predilection*** | Disease predominantly affecting left hepatic lobe | Characteristic of RPC [2] |
| ***Hepatic atrophy*** (usually left lobe) | Volume loss of the affected hepatic lobe | Chronic obstruction → parenchymal destruction → atrophy with compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral lobe [1][2] |
| **Intrahepatic calculi** | Hyperdense foci within dilated ducts | Brown pigment stones are radio-opaque (contain calcium) |
| **Liver abscess** | Rim-enhancing hypodense lesion (double-target sign) [8] | Complication |
| **Suspicious mass** | Irregular enhancing mass within or adjacent to strictured duct | Raises concern for superimposed ***cholangiocarcinoma*** [5] |

**Why CT is important in RPC specifically**: CT demonstrates whether disease is ***localised*** (usually to the left lobe) and whether ***atrophy*** has developed [1] — both critical factors in deciding whether **hepatic resection** is indicated.

#### C3. Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) — Biliary Mapping

***MRCP is a non-contrast, T2-weighted MRI sequence*** that provides exquisite detail of the biliary tree without any invasive intervention [14].

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Technique** | ***Non-contrast, T2-weighted*** — bile appears bright (hyperintense) because it is fluid [14] |
| **Advantages** | ***Non-invasive***; permits ***detailed visualisation of extent of biliary involvement*** which may not be possible by ERCP when there are ***extensively occluded segments*** [1]; no radiation; no contrast needed |
| **Limitations** | ***Does NOT permit therapeutic interventions*** [1] — purely diagnostic |
| **Key findings in RPC** | Intrahepatic duct dilatation and strictures; stone burden mapping; extent of disease (unilateral vs bilateral); biliary anatomy before surgery |
| **When to use** | When USG is equivocal but clinical suspicion remains high; for preoperative biliary mapping; when ERCP cannot access occluded segments [1][6] |

<Callout title="MRCP vs ERCP — Understanding the Trade-off">
***MRCP has largely replaced ERCP as a diagnostic tool*** [14]. ERCP carries procedural risks (pancreatitis, perforation, bacteraemia), so it should be reserved for when **therapeutic intervention is planned**. MRCP gives you the anatomy for free — use it first for mapping, then deploy ERCP when you need to drain, stent, or extract stones.
</Callout>

#### C4. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) — Diagnostic AND Therapeutic

***ERCP is both diagnostic and therapeutic*** and is the ***first-line intervention*** for acute biliary drainage [1][6][7].

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Technique** | Endoscope advanced to duodenum → cannulation of ampulla of Vater → contrast injection → fluoroscopic visualisation of biliary tree |
| **Diagnostic role** | Confirm diagnosis; show level and cause of obstruction; delineate biliary anatomy [6] |
| **Therapeutic role** | ***Biliary drainage and decompression*** (the primary goal in acute setting); sphincterotomy; stricture balloon dilatation; stone extraction; stent placement [1][7] |
| **Key RPC-specific finding** | Multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic stones; strictures; soft brown pigment stones |
| ***Prophylactic antibiotics required*** | ***Due to risk of inciting cholangitis or sepsis following manipulation of bile ducts*** [1] |
| **Bile culture** | Can aspirate bile during ERCP for culture and sensitivity — guides antibiotic therapy [6] |

**Challenges of ERCP in RPC** [1]:
- ***Endoscopic intervention is challenging due to multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic stones as well as stricturing*** [1]
- ERCP accesses the biliary tree from below (retrograde) — it is inherently **limited in reaching intrahepatic ducts**, especially those above tight strictures
- ***ERCP difficult to access intrahepatic drainage*** [2] — this is why **PTBD** is often needed

**ERCP procedure in acute cholangitis** [7]:
1. ***Aspirate bile duct*** to remove bile and pus → decompress biliary tree → reduces risk of bacteraemia during contrast injection
2. Then inject contrast and visualise anatomy
3. Place ***plastic stent*** (temporary, requires scheduled change) with or without sphincterotomy
4. Stone removal can be done **now or deferred** (interval ERCP after sepsis resolves)

> ***Role of ERCP in unstable patients is biliary drainage and decompression — NOT stone removal*** [7]. The priority is to relieve obstruction and control sepsis. Definitive stone clearance comes later.

#### C5. Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography / Biliary Drainage (PTC/PTBD)

***PTBD is preferred to ERCP when the obstruction is at or above the level of confluence of hepatic ducts*** — which is often the case in RPC [14].

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Technique** | Percutaneous needle inserted through the liver parenchyma into a dilated intrahepatic duct → contrast injection for cholangiography → guidewire → catheter placement for drainage |
| **Diagnostic role** | Visualisation of biliary tree above the obstruction (where ERCP cannot reach) [14] |
| **Therapeutic role** | ***Bile drainage by catheter (PTBD)*** or insertion of indwelling stents [14] |
| **When preferred over ERCP** | ***Stricture/obstruction at or above the level of confluence of hepatic ducts*** [14]; ERCP unsuccessful or contraindicated; ***examples include cholangiocarcinoma, PSC, RPC*** [14] |
| **Advantage over ERCP for RPC** | ***Transhepatic insertion of intrahepatic bile duct*** (directly accesses the intrahepatic disease, not limited by retrograde access) [7]; ***easy output monitoring*** (external drainage) [7] |
| **Complications** | ***Bacteraemia*** (thus ***antibiotic prophylaxis required***) [14]; ***haemobilia***; bile leak; pneumothorax (if right-sided approach) |
| **Disadvantage** | ***Risk of fluid and electrolyte loss*** (external drainage) [7]; patient discomfort from external catheter |

#### C6. Choledochoscopy (Intraoperative or Percutaneous)

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Technique** | Direct endoscopic visualisation of bile duct lumen — either during surgery (intraoperative choledochoscopy) or percutaneously through a mature PTBD tract |
| **Role in RPC** | Direct visualisation and removal of intrahepatic stones; inspection for strictures; detection of adult Clonorchis sinensis flukes [3]; biopsy of suspicious lesions (r/o cholangiocarcinoma) |
| **Advantage** | Can reach intrahepatic ducts that ERCP and PTBD cannot; allows direct stone fragmentation and extraction |

#### C7. Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Useful adjunct for ***choledocholithiasis*** detection; staging periampullary and pancreatic cancers [14]; ***therapeutic EUS (EUS-guided cholangiopancreatography)*** as alternative drainage when ERCP fails [7] |
| **Limitation in RPC** | Less useful for mapping intrahepatic disease specifically; better for extrahepatic and periampullary pathology |

#### C8. Other Imaging

| Modality | Role |
|---|---|
| **Erect CXR** | ***Aerobilia*** (air in biliary tree — suggests prior sphincterotomy or biliary-enteric fistula); right basal effusion/collapse (if liver abscess present) [7] |
| **AXR (Abdominal X-ray)** | Radio-opaque calculi in RUQ (brown pigment stones contain calcium → may be visible); aerobilia [7] |
| **MRI liver with contrast** | Liver-specific contrast (e.g., Primovist/gadoxetic acid) — superior to CT in detecting small hepatocellular lesions; useful if cholangiocarcinoma suspected |

---

### Summary: Imaging Modalities Comparison for RPC

| Modality | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **USG** | Non-invasive, bedside, cheap, no radiation, first-line | Operator-dependent; misses distal CBD; misses small stones | ***Always first*** |
| **CT** | Anatomical detail; detects atrophy, abscess, mass; staging | Radiation; IV contrast needed; less biliary detail than MRCP | Surgical planning; r/o complications |
| ***MRCP*** | Best non-invasive biliary mapping; no contrast/radiation | ***Not therapeutic***; cannot intervene | Biliary anatomy mapping; pre-op planning |
| ***ERCP*** | Diagnostic AND therapeutic; gold standard for drainage | Invasive; risks (pancreatitis, perforation, sepsis); ***limited intrahepatic access*** | ***Acute drainage; stone removal*** |
| ***PTBD*** | Directly accesses intrahepatic ducts; external drainage | Invasive; bacteraemia risk; fluid/electrolyte loss | ***When ERCP fails or obstruction at/above confluence*** |
| **Choledochoscopy** | Direct visualisation; stone removal; biopsy capability | Requires mature tract or surgical access | Intraoperative; complex stone disease |
| **EUS** | Good for CBD/periampullary; therapeutic alternative | Limited intrahepatic reach | Adjunct; ERCP failure |

---

### QMH Practice Algorithm for Biliary Drainage [6]

The Queen Mary Hospital (HKU-affiliated) approach to biliary drainage in cholangitis follows this stepwise escalation:

> ***QMH practice: ERCP → PTBD → ECBD*** [6]

1. **ERCP** — first attempt at biliary decompression
2. **PTBD** — if ERCP fails (e.g., cannot access intrahepatic ducts through strictures) or contraindicated
3. **ECBD (Exploration of CBD)** — surgical exploration with T-tube placement if both ERCP and PTBD fail; ***high mortality (~30%)*** [7] — reserved as last resort
