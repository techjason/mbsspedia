## Diagnosis of Rotator Cuff Syndrome

### Diagnostic Principles — "There Is No Single Diagnostic Criterion"

Rotator cuff syndrome is fundamentally a **clinical diagnosis** supported by imaging. There is no single blood test, scoring system, or pathognomonic finding that "confirms" it. Instead, the diagnosis is built from the convergence of:

1. **History**: Activity-related shoulder pain, night pain, weakness, age/risk factors
2. **Physical examination**: Specific provocation tests, active vs passive ROM discrepancy
3. **Imaging**: To confirm the clinical suspicion, grade severity, and guide management

The reason there is no formal "diagnostic criteria" (unlike, say, rheumatoid arthritis or SLE) is that rotator cuff syndrome represents a **continuum** — from mild tendinopathy to massive tear — rather than a binary present/absent disease. The clinical question is not just "does the patient have rotator cuff pathology?" (most people over 60 do), but rather "**is the rotator cuff pathology causing this patient's symptoms, how severe is it, and is it reparable?**"

### Systematic Clinical Assessment

***Physical examination*** is the cornerstone and should follow the structured **Look–Feel–Move** approach [1]:

#### ***Look*** [1]
- **Muscle wasting**: Inspect supraspinous and infraspinous fossae from behind — hollowing indicates chronic denervation or disuse atrophy from a rotator cuff tear
- **Asymmetry**: Compare both shoulders for contour changes, swelling
- **Skin changes**: Scars from prior surgery, bruising (acute tear/trauma)
- **Posture**: Protracted shoulder, guarding posture

#### ***Feel*** [1]
- ***Tenderness over the rotator cuff*** [1]: Palpate the supraspinatus insertion at the greater tuberosity (just distal to the anterolateral acromion with arm slightly extended to bring the tendon anterior)
- Bicipital groove tenderness (anterior) → suggests biceps tendinopathy
- AC joint tenderness (superior) → suggests AC joint pathology
- Subacromial tenderness (lateral) → suggests bursitis/impingement

#### ***Move*** [1]
- ***Active*** ROM [1]: Forward flexion, abduction, external rotation, internal rotation (hand behind back)
- ***Passive*** ROM [1]: Repeat the same movements with the examiner moving the arm
- The key distinction: **Active ↓ with passive preserved = rotator cuff pathology**; **Both ↓ = capsular pathology (frozen shoulder / OA)**

#### ***Special Tests*** [1]

***Jobe test (Empty Can Test)*** [1]:
- Tests: **Supraspinatus**
- Technique: Arm at 90° abduction, 30° forward flexion (in the scapular plane), fully internally rotated (thumb pointing down — like emptying a can). Resist downward force.
- Positive: Pain and/or weakness → supraspinatus pathology
- Why it works: This position isolates the supraspinatus by minimising the contribution of the deltoid, and the internal rotation places the supraspinatus insertion directly under the acromion

***Lift-off test (Gerber's test)*** [1]:
- Tests: **Subscapularis**
- Technique: Place patient's hand behind their back (dorsum of hand resting on the lumbar spine). Ask patient to lift the hand away from the back.
- Positive: Inability to lift the hand off the back → subscapularis tear
- Why it works: Lifting the hand off the back requires active internal rotation against resistance — the subscapularis is the primary internal rotator, and if it's torn, the patient cannot generate force in this position

**Other special tests** (summary from the full examination framework [1]):

| Test | Structure Tested | Technique | Positive Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Neer's impingement sign** | Subacromial impingement | Passively flex shoulder to 180° with arm internally rotated | Anterior shoulder pain |
| **Hawkins' sign** | Subacromial impingement | Flex shoulder and elbow to 90°, passively IR | Anterior shoulder pain |
| **Painful arc** | Subacromial impingement | Active abduction 0–180° | ***Pain between 60° and 120°*** [1] |
| **Drop arm test** | Full-thickness supraspinatus tear | Hold arm at 90° abduction, slowly lower | Arm drops suddenly |
| **External rotation lag** | Infraspinatus | Passively place arm in maximal ER, release | Arm falls into IR |
| **Hornblower's sign** | Teres minor | Resist ER with arm at 90° abduction | Cannot hold position |
| **Belly press test** | Subscapularis (alternative to lift-off) | Press palm against abdomen; attempt to keep elbow forward | Elbow drifts posteriorly (compensating with wrist flexion) |

<Callout title="The Impingement Test vs Impingement Sign" type="idea">
There is a subtle distinction:
- **Impingement sign** = Neer's sign or Hawkins' sign is positive (pain reproduced)
- **Impingement test** (Neer's injection test) = Inject local anaesthetic (e.g., 10 mL 1% lignocaine) into the subacromial space, then repeat the impingement signs. If pain is **abolished**, this confirms the pain originates from the subacromial space (rather than the AC joint, cervical spine, etc.). This is both diagnostic and therapeutic.

<Callout title="Key Diagnostic Pathway Summary">

***Investigation including USG and MRI*** [1]

The pathway is: **Clinical diagnosis → X-ray (baseline) → USG (dynamic assessment for tear) → MRI (gold standard for surgical planning)**

Not every patient needs MRI. A straightforward impingement syndrome in a 45-year-old responding to conservative treatment may only need an X-ray. MRI is reserved for when you need to **grade a tear for surgical decision-making** or when the diagnosis is unclear.
</Callout>

### Investigation Modalities — Detailed Interpretation

#### 1. Plain Radiograph (X-ray) of the Shoulder

**Why do we get it?** It's the first-line imaging for any shoulder complaint — cheap, fast, widely available. It **does not directly visualise** the soft tissue rotator cuff, but it provides critical indirect information and excludes other pathology.

**Standard views**:
- **AP view** (true AP / Grashey view): Humeral head centred on glenoid
- **Axillary view**: Visualises glenohumeral congruency, Hill-Sachs/Bankart lesions
- **Y-view (Supraspinatus outlet view)**: Assesses acromion morphology (Bigliani classification)

**What to look for on X-ray** [2]:

| X-ray Finding | What It Tells You | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Acromiohumeral distance** [2] | Normal: 7–14 mm. Decreased ( < 7 mm) = **proximal migration of humeral head** → suggests massive rotator cuff tear | Without the rotator cuff's depressor force couple, the deltoid's unopposed superior pull drags the humeral head upward against the acromion |
| **Acromion morphology** [2] | Bigliani Type I (flat), II (curved), III (hooked). Type III → ↑ risk of impingement | A hooked acromion physically narrows the subacromial space, directly compressing the supraspinatus |
| **Bony spurs** [2] | Subacromial spurs (inferior acromion), acromial enthesophytes | Traction spurs from chronic coracoacromial ligament stress; directly narrow the subacromial space |
| **Calcification of supraspinatus tendon** [2] | Radio-opaque deposits near the greater tuberosity → **calcific tendonitis** | Calcium hydroxyapatite deposition within the tendon substance in areas of hypoxia/degeneration |
| **AC joint changes** | Joint space narrowing, osteophytes, inferior osteophytes projecting into subacromial space | Osteoarthritis of AC joint; inferior osteophytes can contribute to extrinsic impingement |
| **Fractures** [2] | Exclude greater tuberosity fracture, proximal humerus fracture | Important in traumatic presentations — an acute fracture may mimic or co-exist with a rotator cuff tear |
| **Glenohumeral OA** | Joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, osteophytes | Suggests primary GH OA or secondary cuff tear arthropathy |
| **"Acetabularisation" of the acromion** | The acromion becomes concave/cupped on the undersurface | In chronic massive cuff tears, the humeral head articulates with the acromion → the acromion remodels to accommodate the "new articulation" — a sign of cuff tear arthropathy |

<Callout title="The Acromiohumeral Distance" type="error">
This is one of the most important measurements on a shoulder X-ray. If the acromiohumeral distance is < 7 mm, it strongly suggests a **massive, chronic rotator cuff tear** with superior humeral migration. This finding has implications for surgical planning — a standard rotator cuff repair may not be feasible, and the patient may need a **reverse total shoulder arthroplasty** instead.
</Callout>

---

#### 2. Ultrasound (USG) of the Shoulder

***USG shoulder: dynamic test for tear*** [2]

**Why USG?** It's the first-line imaging for confirming a suspected rotator cuff tear [2]. It is:
- **Dynamic**: You can examine the tendon while the patient actively moves the shoulder — this reveals tears, subluxation of the biceps tendon, and impingement in real-time
- **Operator-dependent**: Accuracy is highly dependent on the skill of the sonographer — in experienced hands, sensitivity and specificity for full-thickness tears approach 90–95%
- **Cost-effective and non-invasive**: No radiation, no contrast, performed in clinic
- **Bilateral comparison**: Can easily scan the contralateral shoulder for comparison

**Key USG Findings**:

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| **Hypoechoic / anechoic defect in tendon** | Tendon tear (partial or full-thickness) — fluid or granulation tissue fills the gap |
| **Non-visualisation of tendon** | Complete retracted tear — the tendon has pulled away from the insertion |
| **Tendon thickening / heterogeneity** | Tendinopathy — disorganised collagen, mucoid degeneration |
| **Subacromial bursal fluid / thickening** | Subacromial bursitis — secondary to impingement |
| **Cortical irregularity of greater tuberosity** | Enthesopathy at the tendon insertion — chronic traction changes |
| **Calcific deposit** | Calcific tendonitis — hyperechoic focus with or without posterior acoustic shadowing |
| **Dynamic impingement** | Bunching of subacromial bursa/tendon during active abduction — confirms impingement |
| **Biceps tendon subluxation/dislocation** | May indicate subscapularis tear (the transverse humeral ligament and subscapularis hold the biceps in the groove) |

**Limitations of USG**:
- Cannot reliably assess **fatty infiltration** of the muscle (critical for assessing reparability)
- Cannot assess **intra-articular pathology** (labral tears, SLAP lesions, glenohumeral cartilage)
- Posterior structures (infraspinatus, teres minor) can be harder to visualise
- **Operator-dependent** — results vary significantly with sonographer experience

---

#### 3. MRI of the Shoulder — Gold Standard

**MRI shoulder: gold standard, degree of tear** [2] — ***irreparable if fatty infiltration or muscle tendon atrophy*** [2]

**Why MRI?** MRI provides the most comprehensive assessment of the rotator cuff and is the definitive pre-operative investigation. It answers the key surgical questions:

1. **Which tendon(s) are torn?** (Supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, or multiple)
2. **Is the tear partial or full-thickness?** And if partial, is it articular-side, bursal-side, or intratendinous?
3. **What is the tear size?** (Small/medium/large/massive)
4. **Is there tendon retraction?** How far has the torn edge pulled back from the insertion?
5. **Is there fatty infiltration of the muscle?** (Goutallier classification — determines reparability)
6. **Is there muscle atrophy?** (Tangent sign — if the supraspinatus muscle belly sits below the tangent line drawn from the scapular spine to the coracoid, atrophy is present)
7. **What is the condition of the remaining cuff?** (Are other tendons degenerative?)
8. **Are there associated pathologies?** (Labral tears, biceps pathology, capsular thickening, GH OA)

**Key MRI sequences and findings**:

| Sequence | What It Shows Best |
|---|---|
| **T1-weighted** | Anatomy, fatty infiltration (fat appears bright/hyperintense on T1) |
| **T2-weighted / PD fat-sat** | Fluid (bright on T2), tendon tears (fluid signal within tendon gap), oedema, bursitis |
| **Oblique coronal** | Best for supraspinatus and infraspinatus tears (perpendicular to the tendon) |
| **Oblique sagittal** | Best for assessing fatty infiltration, tear retraction, muscle bulk |
| **Axial** | Best for subscapularis, biceps tendon in the groove, labral pathology |

**MRI findings in specific conditions**:

| Condition | MRI Appearance |
|---|---|
| **Tendinopathy** | Thickened tendon with intermediate signal on T1/T2 (no discrete fluid-filled defect) |
| **Partial-thickness tear** | Focal area of increased T2 signal within the tendon substance that does not extend full-thickness |
| **Full-thickness tear** | Fluid signal (bright on T2) extending from bursal to articular surface; gap in the tendon |
| **Massive retracted tear** | Tendon stump retracted to or beyond the glenoid level; associated muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration |
| **Fatty infiltration** | Muscle replaced by fat (bright on T1 in the muscle belly) — Goutallier classification |
| **Subacromial bursitis** | Fluid in the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa (bright on T2) |
| **Calcific tendonitis** | Low signal focus on all sequences (calcium is dark on MRI — better seen on X-ray!) |

<Callout title="Goutallier Classification on MRI — Reparability Assessment">
The **Goutallier classification** was originally described on CT but is now routinely applied on MRI oblique sagittal images:

| Stage | Fatty Infiltration | Reparability |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | None | Fully reparable |
| 1 | Fatty streaks | Reparable |
| 2 | < 50% fat | Reparable (borderline if Grade 2+) |
| **3** | **50% fat** | **Generally irreparable** |
| **4** | **> 50% fat** | **Irreparable** |

Goutallier ≥ 3 means the muscle is too fatty/atrophied to function even if the tendon is re-attached surgically. These patients are candidates for **tendon transfer** or **reverse total shoulder arthroplasty** rather than primary repair.
</Callout>

**MR Arthrogram** (MRI with intra-articular gadolinium contrast):
- **When?** When conventional MRI is equivocal, particularly for:
  - **Partial-thickness articular-side tears**: Contrast leaking into a partial tear makes it more conspicuous
  - **Labral pathology / SLAP lesions**: Contrast distends the joint and outlines labral tears
- Not routinely needed for straightforward full-thickness tears (these are well-seen on standard MRI)

---

#### 4. Other Investigations

| Investigation | When / Why |
|---|---|
| **CT scan** | Rarely needed for rotator cuff. Useful for assessing **bony anatomy** (acromion morphology, glenoid bone loss in instability, fractures). CT with 3D reconstruction helps pre-operative planning for arthroplasty. |
| **CT arthrogram** | Alternative to MR arthrogram if MRI is contraindicated (e.g., pacemaker). Contrast outlines intra-articular structures. |
| **Blood tests** | Not diagnostic for rotator cuff syndrome per se, but: **HbA1c** (if frozen shoulder suspected — screen for DM [2]); **ESR/CRP** (if infection or inflammatory arthritis suspected); **FBC, CRP, blood cultures** (if septic arthritis being considered) |
| **Diagnostic subacromial injection** (Neer's impingement test) | Inject 5–10 mL lignocaine into the subacromial space. If pain is abolished and strength improves → confirms subacromial impingement as the pain generator. If pain persists → pain source is elsewhere (AC joint, GH joint, cervical spine) |
| **Nerve conduction studies / EMG** | If cervical radiculopathy or peripheral nerve entrapment is suspected. Differentiates neurogenic weakness from tendon pathology. |

---

### Putting It All Together — The Decision Pathway

The investigation strategy depends on **where you are in the clinical pathway**:

| Clinical Scenario | Recommended Investigation |
|---|---|
| Acute traumatic shoulder pain in young patient | X-ray (exclude fracture/dislocation) → if weakness persists, USG → MRI |
| Chronic activity-related shoulder pain in middle-aged patient, responding to conservative Rx | X-ray (baseline) → clinical monitoring |
| Chronic shoulder pain, failed 6 weeks conservative Rx | X-ray + USG → if tear confirmed, MRI for pre-op planning |
| Suspected massive tear (drop arm+, severe weakness, wasting) | X-ray (acromiohumeral distance) → USG → MRI (assess reparability: fatty infiltration, retraction) |
| Suspected calcific tendonitis (acute severe pain, limited movement) | X-ray (calcification visible) → USG (guided barbotage if needed) |
| Diagnostic uncertainty: is this shoulder or cervical spine? | X-ray shoulder + C-spine → diagnostic subacromial injection → if negative, MRI C-spine / nerve conduction studies |

> ***Investigation including USG and MRI*** [1] — this is the lecture slide's explicit summary of the investigation modalities for rotator cuff pathology. In practice, X-ray is always the starting point, USG is the dynamic bedside/clinic assessment, and MRI is the gold standard for pre-operative planning.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Diagnosis is clinical, supported by imaging** — no formal diagnostic criteria exist for rotator cuff syndrome.

**Physical examination framework**: ***Look, Feel, Move*** [1] → then ***Special tests: Jobe test (supraspinatus), Lift-off test (subscapularis)*** [1], Neer's sign, Hawkins' sign, painful arc, drop arm test.

**Key clinical finding**: Active ROM ↓ with passive ROM preserved → rotator cuff pathology. Both ↓ → frozen shoulder / GH OA.

**X-ray** [2]: First-line. Look for acromiohumeral distance ( < 7 mm = massive tear), acromion morphology, bony spurs, calcification, fractures.

***USG*** [2]: Dynamic test for tear. First-line imaging to confirm tear. Operator-dependent. Cannot assess fatty infiltration.

**MRI** [2]: Gold standard for pre-operative planning. Grades tear size, fatty infiltration (Goutallier), muscle atrophy. ***Irreparable if fatty infiltration or muscle tendon atrophy*** [2].

**Diagnostic subacromial injection**: Confirms subacromial space as pain source when clinical picture is ambiguous.
