## Complications of Cervical Myelopathy

Complications in cervical myelopathy arise from two broad sources: the **disease process itself** (what happens if the cord compression goes untreated or progresses) and the **treatment** (complications of surgery). Both are high-yield and both are directly testable.

---

### A. Complications of the Disease Process (Untreated / Progressive Myelopathy)

The core problem is ongoing spinal cord compression → progressive neuronal loss → irreversible functional decline. The complications are essentially a catalogue of what each damaged tract/system produces as the disease worsens.

#### 1. Progressive Neurological Deterioration

- The natural history of untreated moderate-severe cervical myelopathy is **stepwise or gradual decline** in ~75% of patients.
- ***Motor weakness and sphincteric dysfunction appear in the late stage*** [1] — by the time these develop, substantial irreversible cord damage has occurred.
- ***The spinal cord is very unforgiving*** [3] — unlike peripheral nerves, central neurons do not regenerate.
- ***Complete injury — prognosis is generally poor. Incomplete injury — prognosis highly variable*** [3].

**Pattern of progression:**

| Stage | What Happens | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Early | Hand numbness, subtle clumsiness | Early dorsal column and corticospinal tract compression — mild demyelination, still partially reversible |
| Intermediate | Spastic gait, frequent falls, worsening hand dexterity | Progressive demyelination + early axonal loss in lateral and posterior columns |
| Late | ***Sphincter dysfunction*** [3], severe weakness, wheelchair-dependent | Extensive axonal loss + gliosis + ***myelomalacia (intramedullary signal change)*** [1]; destruction of descending autonomic pathways to sacral micturition/defecation centres |

#### 2. Acute-on-Chronic Deterioration

***Chronic condition with acute deterioration*** [3].

This is the classic scenario of an elderly patient with pre-existing cervical stenosis and mild chronic myelopathy who suffers a minor fall or hyperextension injury → **acute neurological deterioration**.

- ***Central cord syndrome*** [1]: ***Most common incomplete spinal cord injury. Hyperextension injury in a degenerative cervical spine*** [1].
- ***Quadriparesis initially, with recovery*** [1]
- ***Arm affected more than legs*** [1]
- ***Sensory sparing variable*** [1]
- ***Most patients regain ambulation*** [1]
- ***Persistent distal upper limb neurological deficits common*** [1] — even after recovery, fine hand function often remains impaired because the centrally located cervical motor fibres were most damaged.

***Anterior cord syndrome*** [1] (less common but worse prognosis):
- ***Hyperflexion injury with bone or disc fragment*** [1]
- ***Anterior spinal artery compression*** [1]
- ***Motor and pain/temperature loss*** [1]
- ***Posterior column preserved*** [1]
- ***Prognosis poor*** [1]

*Why is the pre-existing stenosis so dangerous?* A normal cervical canal has ~17 mm of AP diameter — plenty of room for the cord (~10 mm). With spondylotic stenosis, this may narrow to 11–12 mm, leaving virtually no CSF buffer. Even a minor hyperextension (ligamentum flavum buckling inward) can pinch the cord against anterior osteophytes. The cord has nowhere to go.

#### 3. ***Sphincter Dysfunction*** — The Point of No Return

***Sphincter dysfunction — a point of no return*** [3].

- **Urinary dysfunction** progresses through stages:
  - **Early:** Urgency, frequency (loss of descending cortical inhibition → detrusor hyperreflexia = the bladder contracts involuntarily because the pontine micturition centre loses cortical modulation)
  - **Late:** Retention with overflow incontinence (loss of coordinated voiding → detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia = the bladder and sphincter contract simultaneously, preventing emptying)
- **Bowel dysfunction:** Constipation → faecal incontinence (same mechanism — loss of descending control over sacral defecation centre S2–S4).
- **Sexual dysfunction:** Erectile dysfunction, loss of ejaculatory control.

*Why is this "the point of no return"?* Sphincter control requires intact descending autonomic pathways from the brainstem (pontine micturition centre) through the entire spinal cord to the sacral segments (S2–S4). By the time these long pathways are sufficiently damaged to produce sphincter dysfunction, there is typically extensive, irreversible cord damage across multiple segments.

#### 4. ***Long-Term Complications of Spinal Cord Dysfunction***

***Long-term issues with dysreflexia, neurogenic bladder, spasticity, contracture, and skin problems*** [3].

These are particularly relevant in severe myelopathy or after traumatic SCI:

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **Autonomic dysreflexia** | Noxious stimulus below the level of lesion (e.g., full bladder, faecal impaction) → massive uncontrolled sympathetic discharge below the lesion → severe hypertension, reflex bradycardia, headache, flushing above the level, pallor below | Medical emergency (hypertensive crisis); occurs in lesions at T6 or above (because splanchnic sympathetic outflow is below T6 — if disconnected from brainstem control, it fires uncontrollably) |
| **Neurogenic bladder** | Upper motor neuron bladder (cord lesion above S2–S4) → hyperreflexic detrusor, small-capacity bladder, urgency/incontinence, high-pressure system → risk of vesicoureteric reflux and renal damage | Requires urodynamic assessment; managed with intermittent catheterisation, anticholinergics, botulinum toxin |
| **Spasticity** | Loss of corticospinal tract inhibition → exaggerated stretch reflexes, increased tone, clonus | Functionally disabling; may cause pain, contractures; managed with baclofen (oral or intrathecal), tizanidine, physiotherapy |
| **Contractures** | Prolonged spasticity + immobility → fixed shortening of muscles, tendons, and joint capsules | Prevented by regular ROM exercises and positioning; once established, may require serial casting or surgery |
| **Pressure ulceration** | Loss of sensation below lesion + immobility → sustained pressure on bony prominences → ischaemic necrosis of skin and underlying tissue | Most common sites: sacrum, ischial tuberosities, heels, trochanters; prevented by regular repositioning, pressure-relieving mattresses; can lead to osteomyelitis, sepsis |

***Organ system complications following spinal cord injury*** [1]:

| ***Organ System*** | ***Complications*** |
|---|---|
| ***Cardiovascular*** | ***Bradycardia/dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic pulmonary oedema*** |
| ***Pulmonary*** | ***Hypoventilation/respiratory failure, poor secretion control, ARDS, aspiration, pneumonia*** |
| ***Gastrointestinal*** | ***Gastric dysmotility, adynamic ileus, gastritis and ulceration, pancreatitis*** |
| ***Haematologic*** | ***Venothromboembolism*** |
| ***Neurologic*** | ***Neurogenic shock, depression, PTSD, anxiety, autonomic dysreflexia*** |
| ***Genitourinary*** | ***Bladder dysfunction, urinary tract infection, priapism*** |
| ***Integument*** | ***Pressure ulceration*** |

Let me explain the "why" behind the key systemic complications:

- ***Bradycardia/cardiac arrest*** [1]: The heart's sympathetic innervation originates from T1–T4. Cervical cord lesions disconnect the heart from sympathetic drive → unopposed vagal (parasympathetic) tone → bradycardia. In severe cases, cardiac arrest can occur.
- ***Hypoventilation/respiratory failure*** [1]: The diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve (C3, C4, C5 — "C3, 4, 5 keeps the diaphragm alive"). High cervical lesions (C3 and above) can paralyse the diaphragm. Even lesions at C5–C8 impair intercostal muscles (T1–T12) and abdominal muscles, reducing cough strength and vital capacity → retained secretions → pneumonia → respiratory failure.
- ***Venothromboembolism (VTE)*** [1]: Loss of lower limb motor function → loss of the calf muscle pump → venous stasis → DVT/PE. This is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in SCI patients. Prophylaxis with LMWH + compression stockings is essential.
- ***Gastritis and ulceration*** [1]: Cushing's ulcer — stress response + disrupted autonomic regulation → increased gastric acid secretion → mucosal ulceration. Prophylaxis with PPI.
- ***Depression, PTSD, anxiety*** [1]: Understandable given the sudden loss of independence and function; high prevalence in SCI patients; requires screening and management.

<Callout title="Respiratory Complications — The #1 Killer" type="error">
Pulmonary complications are the **leading cause of morbidity and mortality** in cervical spinal cord injury patients, both in the acute and chronic phases. A patient with C5 myelopathy still has diaphragmatic function but has lost intercostal and abdominal muscle function → cannot cough effectively → secretion retention → pneumonia → respiratory failure. Aggressive chest physiotherapy and early mobilisation are critical.

### B. Complications of Surgical Treatment

***Counseling patients on complications*** [1]:

#### Anterior Surgery Complications

| ***Complication*** | Pathophysiology / Explanation |
|---|---|
| ***Oesophageal injury (intra-op or late due to implant)*** [1] | The anterior approach requires retraction of the oesophagus medially. Excessive retraction → oesophageal contusion, perforation, or delayed erosion from prominent hardware (plate/screws). Late perforation is rare but devastating → mediastinitis. |
| ***Vertebral artery injury*** [1] | The vertebral arteries run through the transverse foramina of C1–C6, just lateral to the vertebral bodies. Over-zealous lateral dissection or decompression → arterial laceration → massive haemorrhage or posterior circulation stroke. |
| ***Airway compromise*** [1] | Post-operative retropharyngeal haematoma or soft tissue swelling can compress the airway. Most dangerous in the first 24–48 hours. In multilevel ACDF, bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury → bilateral vocal cord paralysis → airway obstruction. Patients are typically observed closely and may have planned delayed extubation. |
| ***Pseudoarthrosis (failed fusion)*** [1] | The bone graft or cage fails to integrate with the adjacent vertebrae → persistent motion at the fused segment → ongoing pain, potential hardware failure, recurrent compression. Risk factors: smoking, multi-level fusion, diabetes, osteoporosis. |
| ***Adjacent level degeneration*** [1] | Fusion eliminates motion at the treated segment → increased stress on the disc levels above and below → accelerated degenerative changes at these adjacent levels → potential need for future surgery. This is one of the strongest arguments for motion-preserving techniques (disc replacement, laminoplasty). |
| **Dysphagia** | Related to oesophageal retraction; very common (up to 50% in the early post-operative period); usually transient (resolves within weeks); persistent in ~5%. More common with multi-level ACDF and revision surgery. |
| **Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy** | The recurrent laryngeal nerve runs in the tracheo-oesophageal groove. Right-sided approaches carry higher risk (the right recurrent laryngeal nerve has a more variable course, looping around the subclavian artery rather than the aortic arch). Results in hoarseness, weak voice, aspiration risk. Usually unilateral → usually recovers. |
| **Graft/cage subsidence** | The graft or cage settles into the soft bone of the vertebral endplates → loss of disc height → loss of lordosis correction → potential foraminal narrowing. More common with osteoporotic bone. |
| **Horner's syndrome** | Rare; damage to the cervical sympathetic chain (runs along the longus colli muscle) during anterior dissection → ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis. |

#### Posterior Surgery Complications

| ***Complication*** | Pathophysiology / Explanation |
|---|---|
| ***Post-op kyphosis*** [1] | Laminectomy without fusion removes the posterior tension band (laminae, spinous processes, supraspinous and interspinous ligaments) → the spine loses its posterior restraint → progressive kyphotic collapse. This is why laminectomy alone is almost never performed without fusion in current practice. Laminoplasty has a lower risk because it preserves some posterior structural integrity. |
| ***Axial symptoms (shoulder and neck pain)*** [1] | Posterior approaches require extensive paraspinal muscle dissection and detachment from the spinous processes → denervation, atrophy, and scarring of the posterior cervical musculature → chronic axial neck and shoulder pain. ***Laminoplasty patients may experience more post-op axial neck pain*** [1]. Reported in 30–60% of patients after posterior cervical surgery. |
| ***C5 nerve root paresis*** [1] | This is a unique and important complication. After posterior decompression (laminoplasty or laminectomy + fusion), the cord drifts posteriorly away from the anterior compression. As the cord shifts back, the C5 nerve root (which is the shortest cervical root and has the most acute takeoff angle from the cord) gets stretched or tethered → segmental motor palsy → acute deltoid and/or biceps weakness, typically appearing 1–3 days post-operatively. Incidence: 5–15%. Usually recovers over weeks to months but can be permanent. |
| **Wound infection** | Posterior cervical wounds have a higher infection rate than anterior wounds (larger wound, more muscle dissection, dead space). Deep infection may require washout and long-term antibiotics. |
| **Epidural haematoma** | Bleeding into the epidural space post-operatively → cord compression → acute neurological deterioration. A surgical emergency requiring urgent evacuation. More common in patients on anticoagulants. |
| **Hardware failure** | Screw pullout, rod fracture, or loosening → loss of fixation → instability and recurrent compression. Risk factors: osteoporosis, multi-level constructs, excessive motion. |
| **Dural tear / CSF leak** | Incidental durotomy during decompression → CSF leak → headache, wound leakage, risk of meningitis. More common in revision surgery or when OPLL is adherent to the dura. |

<Callout title="C5 Palsy — A Must-Know Complication" type="idea">
C5 palsy is uniquely associated with **posterior cervical decompression**. Why C5 specifically?
1. The C5 root is the **shortest cervical root** — it has the least slack.
2. It has the **most perpendicular angle of exit** from the cord.
3. When the cord drifts posteriorly after decompression, C5 is the root most likely to be stretched beyond its limit → traction neuropraxia.

**Clinical presentation:** New-onset deltoid weakness ± biceps weakness 1–3 days after surgery. The patient could abduct their shoulder before surgery but now suddenly cannot.

**Management:** Observation (most recover); physiotherapy; some surgeons perform prophylactic foraminotomy at C4/5 during posterior decompression to reduce the risk.

### C. Prognosis

***Prognosis*** [1]:

- ***Complete injury — poor*** [1]
  - ***No motor or sensory recovery, including sacral roots, distal to the site of injury and at the end of spinal shock*** [1]
- ***Incomplete injury — good*** [1]
  - ***Degree of sparing*** [1]
  - ***Speed of recovery*** [1]

**Prognostic factors for cervical spondylotic myelopathy specifically:**

| Factor | Better Outcome | Worse Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-operative mJOA | Higher (less severe) | Lower (more severe) |
| Duration of symptoms | Shorter | Longer (> 2 years → poorer recovery) |
| MRI signal change | None | T2 hyperintensity (worse: T1 hypointensity = ***myelomalacia*** [1]) |
| Age | Younger | Older (> 70 years) |
| Extent of injury | ***Incomplete*** [3] | ***Complete*** [3] |
| Sphincter function | Preserved | ***Sphincter dysfunction = point of no return*** [3] |
| Number of compressed levels | Single level | Multi-level |
| Smoking status | Non-smoker | Smoker (impairs fusion, impairs microvascular recovery) |

For **central cord syndrome** specifically:
- ***Most patients regain ambulation*** [1] — the lower limb fibres (peripheral in the corticospinal tract) are relatively spared.
- ***Persistent distal upper limb neurological deficits common*** [1] — the hand intrinsic muscles (medial/central fibres) are the most affected and recover the least. This has profound functional implications: the patient can walk but cannot button a shirt or use chopsticks.

Mechanism: noxious stimulus below the lesion level (commonly full bladder or faecal impaction) triggers massive uncontrolled sympathetic discharge below the lesion (because descending inhibitory pathways are interrupted). Above T6, the splanchnic bed sympathetics fire unopposed causing severe vasoconstriction and hypertension. Baroreceptors detect hypertension and trigger vagal bradycardia, but the descending sympatholytic response cannot reach below the lesion. Immediate management: sit patient upright, identify and remove the noxious stimulus (catheterise bladder, check for faecal impaction), antihypertensives if severe."

    {
      question: "What is the prognosis of central cord syndrome? Which functions recover and which tend to remain impaired?",
      markscheme: "Prognosis is relatively good compared to other incomplete cord syndromes. Most patients regain ambulation because lower limb corticospinal fibres are located peripherally in the lateral corticospinal tract and are relatively spared. However, persistent distal upper limb neurological deficits are common because the centrally located cervical motor fibres (controlling hand intrinsics) are most damaged. Patients typically can walk but have difficulty with fine motor tasks such as using chopsticks or buttoning shirts."
