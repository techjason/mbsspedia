## Definition

Cervical myelopathy refers to the clinical syndrome resulting from **compression of the cervical spinal cord** within the cervical spinal canal [1][2]. The word itself breaks down nicely: "cervical" = pertaining to the neck, "myelo-" (Greek _myelos_) = spinal cord, "-pathy" (Greek _pathos_) = disease/suffering. So literally: a disease of the spinal cord at the neck level.

This is fundamentally different from cervical _radiculopathy_, which is compression of a **nerve root** (peripheral nerve issue → lower motor neuron signs), whereas myelopathy is compression of the **spinal cord itself** (central nervous system issue → upper motor neuron signs below the level, potentially lower motor neuron signs at the level).

<Callout title="Key Distinction">
  Myelopathy = spinal **cord** compression → UMN signs below, LMN signs at the
  level. Radiculopathy = nerve **root** compression → LMN signs in that root's
  distribution only. These can and frequently do coexist — this is called
  **myeloradiculopathy**.

## Epidemiology

- **Most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults over 55 years old** worldwide [1].
- **_Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is the most common cause_** — degenerative disease accounts for the overwhelming majority of cases [1][2].
- **_Bimodal distribution of spinal cord injury_** [3]:
  - **_Young adults: high-energy trauma_**
  - **_Old adults: low-energy trauma, osteoporotic bone, pre-existing spinal stenosis_** — even a simple fall in an elderly patient with a degenerative narrowed canal can cause acute-on-chronic myelopathy (classically **central cord syndrome**).
- **Male predominance** overall, particularly for OPLL and degenerative spondylosis.
- **Geographic relevance (Hong Kong/Asia)**:
  - **_Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is much more common in Asian vs non-Asian populations (up to 2–4%)_** [3] — this is a distinctly important cause in our population.
  - Rheumatoid arthritis with cervical spine involvement is also relevant, though RA medications have reduced its incidence [3].
  - TB spine (Pott's disease) remains a consideration in Hong Kong given regional TB prevalence.

## Anatomy and Function

Understanding cervical myelopathy requires solid knowledge of the cervical spinal anatomy, because the clinical features are entirely dictated by _what gets compressed and where_.

### The Cervical Spine (C1–C7)

- **7 cervical vertebrae**, but **8 cervical nerve roots** (C1–C8).
- **_C8 exits between C7 and T1 (there is no C8 vertebra)_** [2].
- **_Above C8: nerve roots exit above their corresponding vertebra_** (e.g., C4 root exits between C3/C4) [2].
- **_Below C8: nerve roots exit below their corresponding vertebra_** (e.g., L4 exits between L4/L5) [2].

This numbering system matters clinically: a C5/6 disc prolapse will compress the **C6 nerve root** (exits above C7 but below C6).

### The Spinal Canal and Its Contents

The cervical spinal cord sits within the spinal canal, surrounded by:

1. **Anterior structures** (front):
   - Vertebral bodies
   - Intervertebral discs
   - **_Posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL)_** — runs along the posterior aspect of the vertebral bodies inside the canal [1][2]
     - **_Ossification of PLL (OPLL) is very common in Japanese and Chinese — a common cause of cervical myelopathy_** [2]

2. **Posterior structures** (back):
   - Laminae
   - **_Ligamentum flavum (LF)_** — connects adjacent laminae [1][2]
     - **_Dynamic compression: osteophytes + buckled LF during extension_** — this is why extension worsens myelopathy [2]
     - **_Ossification of LF (OLF)_** can also contribute [2]
   - Spinous processes
   - Supraspinous and interspinous ligaments

3. **Lateral structures**:
   - Pedicles
   - Facet (apophyseal/zygapophyseal) joints
   - Neural foramina — where nerve roots exit

### Cross-Sectional Anatomy of the Spinal Cord

This is critical for understanding the clinical signs:

| Tract                             | Location in Cord      | Function                              | What Happens When Compressed                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Corticospinal tract (lateral)** | Lateral columns       | Voluntary motor (UMN)                 | Weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, upgoing plantars                         |
| **Spinothalamic tract**           | Anterolateral columns | Pain and temperature                  | Loss of pain/temperature sensation                                            |
| **Dorsal columns**                | Posterior columns     | Proprioception, vibration, fine touch | Loss of proprioception → sensory ataxia, positive Romberg                     |
| **Anterior horn cells**           | Central grey matter   | LMN to muscles at that level          | LMN signs at the level of compression (atrophy, fasciculations, hyporeflexia) |

The **somatotopic arrangement** of the corticospinal and spinothalamic tracts is key:

- In the **lateral corticospinal tract**: cervical fibres are **medial** (central), sacral fibres are **lateral** (peripheral).
- This is why **central cord syndrome** (compression from within outward) preferentially affects the **upper limbs** (cervical fibres are central) while relatively sparing the **lower limbs** (sacral fibres are peripheral) [3].

### Vascular Supply

- **Anterior spinal artery** (single) — supplies the anterior 2/3 of the cord (corticospinal tracts, spinothalamic tracts, anterior horn cells).
- **Posterior spinal arteries** (paired) — supply the posterior 1/3 (dorsal columns).
- Compression can compromise these vessels, adding an ischaemic component to the mechanical compression — this is part of why myelopathy can be progressive and irreversible.

### Spinal Canal Dimensions

- **_Pavlov ratio > 0.8 is normal_** (ratio of spinal canal AP diameter to vertebral body AP diameter) [2]. A ratio < 0.8 indicates **congenital spinal stenosis** — these patients have less "reserve space" and are more vulnerable to developing myelopathy from even mild degenerative changes.
- Normal cervical canal AP diameter: ~17 mm. Myelopathy typically develops when the canal narrows to < 13 mm.

## Etiology (Focus on Hong Kong)

The causes of cervical myelopathy can be broadly divided into **compressive** (structural) and **non-compressive** causes [4]. For clinical purposes and exams, the compressive causes dominate.

### Compressive Causes (by location) [4]

**_By location:_**

- **_Extradural_**
- **_Intradural extramedullary_**
- **_Intradural intramedullary_**

#### 1. Degenerative (Most Common Cause Overall) [1][2][4]

**_Cervical spondylosis is the most common (MC) cause_** [2].

Degenerative changes include:

- **_Spondylosis_** (wear-and-tear degeneration of the vertebral column)
- **_Disc degeneration/prolapse_** — herniated disc material directly compresses the cord anteriorly [4]
- **_Osteophytes_** — bony spurs from degenerative vertebral endplates [4]
- **_Apophyseal (facet) joint hypertrophy_** — narrows the canal and foramina [4]
- **_Hypertrophy/buckling of the ligamentum flavum_** — compresses the cord posteriorly, especially in extension [1][2]
- **_Instability_** [4]
- **_Spinal canal stenosis_** [4]
- **_Degenerative spondylolisthesis_** — forward slip of one vertebra on another [2]

**Pathophysiology of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM):**

The degenerative cascade works like this:

1. Disc desiccation and loss of height → abnormal loading on vertebral endplates
2. Osteophyte formation (body's attempt to stabilise) → anterior cord compression
3. Facet joint hypertrophy → lateral and posterolateral narrowing
4. Ligamentum flavum buckling/hypertrophy → posterior cord compression
5. Segmental instability → dynamic compression (worse with movement, especially extension)

The result is **circumferential narrowing** of the spinal canal → direct mechanical compression of the cord + ischaemia from vascular compromise → demyelination, neuronal loss, and gliosis.

**_Myelopathy = central compression; Radiculopathy = lateral compression_** [4].

**_Can present as chronic progressive OR acute exacerbation_** [4] — the classic scenario is an elderly patient with long-standing mild symptoms who deteriorates acutely after a minor fall (acute-on-chronic myelopathy → often **central cord syndrome**).

#### 2. Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (OPLL) [1][3]

- **_Ectopic calcification as a cause of cord compression_** [3]
- **_Much more common in Asian vs non-Asian populations (up to 2–4%)_** [3]
- **_Male predominance, affects younger population_** [3]
- **_More commonly affects cervical than thoracic spine_** [3]

**Pathophysiology:** The PLL, which normally lies just posterior to the vertebral bodies, undergoes heterotopic ossification (the ligament turns to bone). This creates a rigid bony bar that compresses the cord from the front. It is often multi-segmental.

**Why is it relevant in Hong Kong?** OPLL has a strong genetic predisposition in East Asian populations. It should always be in the differential for a younger Asian male presenting with cervical myelopathy.

#### 3. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) [3]

- **_High prevalence of cervical spine involvement_** in RA [3]
- **_Formation of retroodontoid pannus_** — synovial inflammatory tissue behind the dens [3]
- **_Synovial inflammation predisposes to cervical instability_** [3]:
  - **_Atlantoaxial subluxation (C1/2)_** — most common pattern; the transverse ligament is destroyed by pannus, allowing C1 to slide forward on C2
  - **_Subaxial subluxation_** — "staircase" pattern of multiple levels subluxing
  - **_Vertical subluxation (basilar invagination)_** — the dens migrates superiorly through the foramen magnum
- **_Use of RA medications reduces the incidence of cervical involvement_** [3] — good disease control with DMARDs/biologics prevents ligamentous destruction.
- **_Atlantodental interval (ADI)_**: abnormal (atlantoaxial subluxation) if **_ADI ≥ 3 mm (adult) or ≥ 5 mm (children)_** [2].
- **_Causes of atlantoaxial subluxation: trauma, Down syndrome (absent transverse ligament), RA (inflammation/rupture of transverse ligament)_** [2].

#### 4. Congenital Spinal Stenosis [2]

- Patients born with a constitutionally narrow canal (Pavlov ratio < 0.8).
- They have less "reserve space" and are more vulnerable to myelopathy from even minor degenerative changes or minor trauma.

#### 5. Trauma [2][3]

- Direct fracture-dislocation → bony fragment or haematoma compressing the cord.
- **_Central cord syndrome: hyperextension injury in a degenerative cervical spine_** [3] — the most classic acute traumatic myelopathy in the elderly.
  - **_Most common incomplete spinal cord injury_** [3]
  - Mechanism: hyperextension → **_pinching of cord between anterior osteophytes and infolded/thickened ligamentum flavum posteriorly_** [3]

#### 6. Neoplastic [4]

- **_Primary or secondary (metastatic) tumours_** [4]
- Extradural metastases (most common spinal tumours) — from lung, breast, prostate, kidney, thyroid (mnemonic: **Pb-KTL** — Lead Kills The Lungs/Liver, or the "paired organs" mnemonic).
- Intradural extramedullary: meningioma, schwannoma/neurofibroma.
- Intradural intramedullary: ependymoma, astrocytoma.

#### 7. Infective [4]

- **_Abscess / TB spine_** [4]
- Epidural abscess — bacterial (Staph aureus most common) or tuberculous.
- Pott's disease (TB spondylitis) — relevant in Hong Kong. Typically involves anterior vertebral body → collapse → kyphotic deformity → cord compression.

#### 8. Cystic [4]

- **_Arachnoid cyst_**
- **_Syringomyelia_** — fluid-filled cavity within the cord itself (technically intramedullary).

#### 9. Vascular [4]

- **_Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)_**

### Non-Compressive Causes [4]

- **_Transverse myelitis_** — inflammatory; **_diagnosis by exclusion; LP shows high CSF protein_** [4]
- **_Arterial occlusion_** — **_thromboembolic occlusion of spinal arteries and segmental supply; iatrogenic (e.g., aortic surgery)_** [4]
- **_Spinal arteriovenous fistula_** — **_spinal cord oedema and haemorrhage_** [4]
- Multiple sclerosis (demyelination)
- Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) — aquaporin-4 antibody-mediated
- Subacute combined degeneration (B12 deficiency)

<Callout title="Hong Kong High-Yield Causes" type="idea">

## Pathophysiology (Detailed)

The pathophysiology of cervical myelopathy involves a combination of **static mechanical compression**, **dynamic mechanical compression**, and **secondary ischaemia**.

### 1. Static Mechanical Compression

Fixed structural narrowing of the spinal canal by:

- Osteophytes (anterior)
- Disc herniation (anterior/anterolateral)
- OPLL (anterior)
- Hypertrophied/ossified ligamentum flavum (posterior)
- Facet joint hypertrophy (posterolateral)

This directly compresses the spinal cord, damaging axons and myelin sheaths.

### 2. Dynamic Mechanical Compression

**_Dynamic compression: osteophytes + buckled LF during extension_** [2].

During **neck extension**, the ligamentum flavum buckles inward and the spinal canal shortens — this further narrows the canal. Conversely, **neck flexion** opens up the canal. This is why patients often adopt a slightly flexed posture and why extension is dangerous in cervical myelopathy.

During **neck flexion**, the cord is draped over anterior osteophytes like a towel over a clothesline, increasing tension on the cord.

### 3. Ischaemia

Compression of the spinal cord also compromises its blood supply:

- Compression of the **anterior spinal artery** → ischaemia to the anterior 2/3 of the cord (motor tracts, spinothalamic tracts).
- Compression of intramedullary vessels → microvascular ischaemia.
- This ischaemic component explains why recovery after decompression may be incomplete — there is already irreversible neuronal loss.

### 4. Histopathological Changes

The combination of mechanical and vascular injury leads to:

- **Demyelination** of lateral and posterior columns
- **Wallerian degeneration** of ascending and descending tracts
- **Neuronal loss** in grey matter (especially anterior horn cells at the level of compression)
- **Gliosis** (scarring) — this is seen as **intramedullary signal change on MRI** (T2 hyperintensity = myelomalacia/gliosis; T1 hypointensity = more advanced, worse prognosis).

**_MRI interpretation: intramedullary signal change (myelomalacia)_** [1] — this is a marker of irreversible damage and a poor prognostic sign.

## Classification

### Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) Score [2]

The JOA score is the most widely used classification for **severity assessment** of cervical myelopathy.

- Assesses: upper limb motor function, lower limb motor function, sensory function, and bladder function.
- **Maximum score = 17** (normal).
- **Lower score = more severe myelopathy**.
- Used to calculate **recovery rate** after surgery:
  - Recovery rate (%) = (Post-op JOA − Pre-op JOA) / (17 − Pre-op JOA) × 100

### Modified JOA (mJOA) Score

- More commonly used in Western literature.
- **Maximum score = 18**.
- Classification:
  - Mild myelopathy: mJOA 15–17
  - Moderate myelopathy: mJOA 12–14
  - Severe myelopathy: mJOA < 12

### Nurick Grading (Historical)

Focuses on gait:

- Grade 0: Root signs only, no cord involvement
- Grade 1: Signs of cord involvement, normal gait
- Grade 2: Gait difficulty, but employed and mobile
- Grade 3: Gait difficulty, needs assistance, unable to work
- Grade 4: Only walks with aid
- Grade 5: Wheelchair-bound or bedridden

### **_Neurological Level Diagnosis of Cervical Stenotic Myelopathy (Seichi et al., 2006)_** [1]

**_A new index of neurological level diagnosis:_**

| Feature                              | **_C3–C4_**        | **_C4–C5_**        | **_C5–C6_**          | **_C6–C7_**        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| **_Reflex_**                         | **_BTR ↑_**        | **_BTR ↑ or →_**   | **_BTR → or ↓_**     | **_BTR →_**        |
|                                      | **_TTR ↑_**        | **_TTR ↑_**        | **_TTR ↑ or →_**     | **_TTR →_**        |
|                                      | **_FF ↑_**         | **_FF ↑_**         | **_FF ↑_**           | **_FF ↑_**         |
| **_Uppermost muscle with weakness_** | **_Deltoid_**      | **_Biceps_**       | **_Triceps or EDC_** | **_APB or ADM_**   |
| **_Sensory disturbance_**            | **_C4 dermatome_** | **_C5 dermatome_** | **_C6 dermatome_**   | **_C7 dermatome_** |

_(BTR = biceps tendon reflex; TTR = triceps tendon reflex; FF = finger flexor reflex; EDC = extensor digitorum communis; APB = abductor pollicis brevis; ADM = abductor digiti minimi)_ [1]

This table is extraordinarily useful for localizing the level of compression based on the clinical examination. The key principle:

- **Reflexes are increased (UMN) below the level** and **decreased or inverted at the level**.
- The **uppermost weak muscle** tells you the level of compression (because LMN damage occurs at that segment).

## Clinical Features

### Overview of Presentation

**_Clinical features of cervical myelopathy_** [1]:

- **_Numbness or sensory disturbance (fingers, upper limb)_**
- **_Loss of hand dexterity_**
- **_Poor proprioception + spastic gait_**
- **_Motor weakness and sphincteric dysfunction appear in the late stage_**
- **_Pain is not a predominant feature_**
- **_Upper motor neuron signs below level of compression_**
- **_Lower motor neuron signs at the level of compression_**

<Callout title="Pain Is NOT the Main Feature!" type="error">
  A common mistake is assuming cervical myelopathy presents primarily with pain.
  ***Pain is not a predominant feature*** [1]. The cardinal features are
  **numbness, clumsiness, gait instability, and UMN signs**. Pain is more
  typical of radiculopathy. If a patient has predominantly painless progressive
  dysfunction of the hands and gait — think myelopathy.
</Callout>

### Symptoms

#### 1. Upper Limb Symptoms

| Symptom                                                           | Pathophysiological Basis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Numbness/sensory disturbance in fingers and upper limbs_** [1] | Compression of the dorsal columns (proprioception, fine touch, vibration) and/or spinothalamic tracts (pain, temperature) at the cervical level. The hands are often affected first because the cervical cord segments innervating the hands (C6–T1) are the ones being compressed.                                                           |
| **_Loss of hand dexterity_** [1]                                  | LMN damage to anterior horn cells at the level of compression (C7–T1 innervate intrinsic hand muscles) + UMN damage to the corticospinal tract above these segments → loss of fine motor control. Patients report dropping objects, difficulty with buttons, chopsticks (particularly relevant in Hong Kong!), and handwriting deterioration. |
| Upper limb weakness                                               | Combination of LMN weakness at the level (lower motor neuron damage to anterior horn cells) and UMN weakness below the level (corticospinal tract damage).                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Pseudoathetosis (involuntary writhing movements of fingers)       | Loss of proprioception from dorsal column compression → the brain doesn't know where the fingers are → involuntary slow movements when the eyes are closed [2].                                                                                                                                                                               |

#### 2. Lower Limb Symptoms

| Symptom                                          | Pathophysiological Basis                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **_Spastic gait / gait instability_** [1]        | UMN damage to the lateral corticospinal tracts → spasticity and weakness in the lower limbs. The legs are controlled by spinal segments below the cervical cord, so any cervical cord compression will affect them via UMN pathways. |
| **_Poor proprioception_** [1]                    | Dorsal column compression → impaired joint position sense → sensory ataxia → unsteady gait, especially in the dark or with eyes closed.                                                                                              |
| Difficulty with tandem (heel-to-toe) walking [2] | Combined posterior column (proprioceptive) and lateral column (corticospinal/spasticity) dysfunction makes balance tasks extremely difficult.                                                                                        |
| Lower limb numbness                              | Spinothalamic and/or dorsal column involvement.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

#### 3. Neck Symptoms

| Symptom                                                                                            | Pathophysiological Basis                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Neck pain and stiffness [2]                                                                        | From the underlying degenerative spondylosis (facet joint arthritis, disc degeneration) rather than the cord compression itself. Remember: **pain is not a predominant feature of myelopathy itself** — it comes from the degenerative process. |
| **Lhermitte's sign** (electric shock sensation radiating down the spine/limbs on neck flexion) [2] | Neck flexion stretches the already-compressed and demyelinated dorsal columns over anterior osteophytes → mechanosensitivity of damaged axons → electrical discharge sensation.

| Reversed Lhermitte's sign (same sensation on neck extension) [2]                                   | Extension causes ligamentum flavum to buckle into the cord posteriorly → compression of dorsal columns.                                                                                                                                         |

| **_Sphincteric dysfunction (urinary retention/incontinence)_** [1] | **_Appears in the late stage_** [1]. The descending pathways controlling the sacral micturition centre (S2–S4) are interrupted by cervical cord compression. Initially presents as urgency/frequency (loss of inhibitory control → detrusor hyperreflexia), later as retention (loss of coordinated voiding). |
| Bowel dysfunction                                                  | Similar mechanism — loss of descending control over sacral defecation centre.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### **_Myelopathic Hand Signs_** [1][2]

| **_Hoffmann's sign_** [1]                           | Flick the distal phalanx of the middle finger downward; positive if thumb and index finger flex reflexly.                                      | Analogous to a Babinski sign for the upper limb. Release of primitive flexor reflex due to loss of corticospinal tract inhibition → UMN sign.                                                                                                                     |
| **_Finger escape sign_** [1]                        | Ask patient to hold all fingers extended and adducted; positive if the little finger (and then ring finger) drifts into abduction and flexion. | The ulnar-innervated intrinsic muscles (controlled by C8/T1 segments) are the earliest to lose corticospinal input → the little finger "escapes" because it can no longer maintain its position against intrinsic muscle tone imbalance.                          |
| **_10-second grip-and-release test_** [1]           | Ask patient to rapidly open and close fists for 10 seconds; count the number of cycles. Normal: ≥ 20 cycles. Abnormal: < 20 cycles.            | Impaired fine motor control from corticospinal tract dysfunction → slowed rapid alternating movements.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Inverted supinator (brachioradialis) reflex** [2] | Tap the brachioradialis tendon at the distal radius. Instead of elbow flexion (normal), you get finger flexion.                                | LMN damage at C5/C6 (brachioradialis segment) abolishes the normal reflex arc, but UMN damage below releases the C8/T1 finger flexor reflex → the reflex is "inverted" — you tap C6 but get a C8 response. This is pathognomonic of cervical myelopathy at C5/C6. |
| **Inverted biceps reflex** [2]                      | Tap biceps tendon. Instead of biceps contraction, you get triceps contraction (elbow extension) or finger flexion.                             | Same principle: LMN damage at C5/C6 (biceps level) + UMN release of C7 (triceps) or C8 (finger flexors) reflexes below.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Grip and release test** [2]                       | Patient repeatedly grips and releases — observe speed and clumsiness.                                                                          | Corticospinal tract dysfunction → impaired rapid alternating hand movements.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

<Callout title="Inverted Reflexes — The Key Concept">
An "inverted reflex" is the **single most localising sign** in cervical myelopathy. It tells you:
1. **LMN damage AT the level** (the normal reflex is lost)
2. **UMN damage BELOW the level** (a reflex from a lower segment is released)

Example: Inverted supinator reflex = LMN lesion at C5/C6 + UMN lesion below C6. This localises compression to the C5/C6 level precisely.

The normal adult plantar response (toe flexion) requires an intact corticospinal tract to suppress the primitive extension pattern. |
| **_Positive Romberg sign_** [1]                  | Patient stands with feet together, eyes closed; positive if patient sways/falls | Dorsal column dysfunction → loss of proprioception. Patient can compensate with vision (eyes open OK), but removing visual input (eyes closed) unmasks the proprioceptive deficit.                                           |
| **_Failed tandem walking test_** [1]             | Heel-to-toe walking                                                             | Requires intact proprioception + corticospinal tract function. Both are impaired in myelopathy → patient cannot maintain balance on a narrow base.                                                                           |

| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dermatomal sensory loss at the level of compression   | Direct damage to the spinothalamic tract or dorsal column fibres entering at that segment                                                                                                                                            |
| Sensory level (if severe)                             | Complete interruption of ascending sensory tracts → loss of sensation below the level. T4 = nipple, T10 = umbilicus [2]. However, in cervical myelopathy a clear-cut sensory level is less common than in thoracic cord compression. |
| Loss of proprioception and vibration (dorsal columns) | Compression of posterior columns → impaired joint position sense, impaired vibration sense in hands and feet                                                                                                                         |
| Dissociated sensory loss (in central cord syndrome)   | Central cord lesion preferentially damages crossing spinothalamic fibres → "cape-like" loss of pain/temperature with preserved dorsal column function                                                                                |

#### **_Central Cord Syndrome_** [3][4]

**_Most common incomplete spinal cord injury_** [3].

- **_Hyperextension injury in a degenerative cervical spine_** [3]
- **_Pinching of cord between anterior osteophytes and posterior ligamentum flavum_** [3]
- Affects **central grey matter and medial portions of the corticospinal and spinothalamic tracts**
- Clinical pattern:
  - **Upper limbs affected more than lower limbs** (because cervical motor fibres are located centrally in the corticospinal tract, while sacral/lumbar fibres are peripheral)
  - Variable sensory loss (often dissociated — loss of pain/temperature in a cape distribution due to crossing spinothalamic fibres being damaged centrally)
  - Bladder dysfunction common
- Classic scenario: **_Old man with degenerated spine after a fall_** [4]

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Definition:** Cervical myelopathy = compression of the cervical spinal cord → UMN signs below the level, LMN signs at the level.

**Epidemiology:** Most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults > 55. Bimodal age distribution for traumatic causes. OPLL prevalence 2–4% in Asian populations.

**Top Causes (HK-focused):**

1. Cervical spondylosis (MC)
2. OPLL (Asian predominance)
3. RA (atlantoaxial subluxation)
4. Trauma (central cord syndrome in elderly)
5. TB spine / epidural abscess

**Pathophysiology:** Static + dynamic mechanical compression + ischaemia → demyelination, neuronal loss, gliosis.

**Cardinal Clinical Features:**

- Numbness and loss of hand dexterity (NOT primarily pain!)
- Spastic gait with poor proprioception
- Myelopathic hand signs: Hoffmann's, finger escape, 10-second test, inverted reflexes
- LL: spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, upgoing plantars, positive Romberg
- Sphincteric dysfunction is LATE

**Key Exam Concepts:**

- Inverted reflexes = LMN at the level + UMN below = pathognomonic
- Central cord syndrome = hyperextension + degenerative spine → UL > LL weakness
- Pavlov ratio < 0.8 = congenital stenosis
- ADI ≥ 3 mm (adult) = atlantoaxial subluxation
- MRI intramedullary signal change = myelomalacia = poor prognosis

Prevalence up to 2-4% in Asian (Japanese, Chinese) populations vs much lower in non-Asian populations. Male predominance, affects younger population, more commonly cervical than thoracic spine.",

        "Name four myelopathic hand signs and briefly explain the mechanism of each.",
      markscheme:
        "(1) Hoffmann sign — flicking middle finger DIP causes thumb/index flexion; release of primitive flexor reflex due to corticospinal tract damage (UMN sign). (2) Finger escape sign — little finger abducts/flexes when trying to hold fingers extended/adducted; earliest loss of corticospinal input to ulnar-innervated intrinsics (C8/T1). (3) 10-second grip-and-release test — fewer than 20 cycles in 10s; impaired rapid alternating movements from corticospinal dysfunction. (4) Inverted reflexes (supinator/biceps) — LMN loss at level + UMN release below level.",

      question:
        "What Pavlov ratio indicates congenital cervical stenosis, and what ADI value indicates atlantoaxial subluxation in an adult? Name three causes of atlantoaxial subluxation.",
      markscheme:
        "Pavlov ratio less than 0.8 indicates congenital cervical stenosis. ADI 3 mm or more in adults indicates atlantoaxial subluxation. Three causes: (1) Trauma, (2) Down syndrome (absent/lax transverse ligament), (3) Rheumatoid arthritis (inflammation/rupture of transverse ligament by pannus).",
