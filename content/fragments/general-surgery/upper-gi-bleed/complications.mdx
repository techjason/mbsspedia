## Complications of Upper GI Bleed

Complications of UGIB can be organised into three categories:

1. **Complications of the bleeding itself** (hypovolaemia, organ damage)
2. **Complications of the underlying disease** (perforation, obstruction, malignancy)
3. **Complications of treatment** (endoscopic, pharmacological, surgical, and interventional radiology)

Understanding each complication from first principles means tracing the chain from *what went wrong* → *why it causes harm* → *how to recognise it* → *how to manage it*.

---

### 1. Complications of the Bleeding Itself

These are consequences of **acute blood loss** and **hypovolaemia**. Every complication below flows from the same root problem: **insufficient oxygen delivery to tissues**.

#### 1.1 Hypovolaemic Shock

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| Mechanism | Acute haemorrhage → ↓ circulating blood volume → ↓ venous return → ↓ cardiac output → ↓ tissue perfusion → cellular hypoxia → anaerobic metabolism → lactic acidosis |
| Recognition | Tachycardia → hypotension → oliguria → confusion → obtundation (follows ATLS classification: Class I–IV) [3] |
| Key point | ***Blood pressure does NOT drop until > 30% of blood volume is lost*** (Class III) — tachycardia is the **earliest** compensatory sign. Relying on BP alone leads to false reassurance [3] |
| Management | Aggressive fluid resuscitation + blood transfusion + source control (endoscopic/surgical haemostasis) |

**Why does shock kill?** Prolonged tissue hypoperfusion leads to **multi-organ failure** — the organs most vulnerable are those with the highest metabolic demand (brain, kidneys, heart) and those dependent on high blood flow (splanchnic bed → gut mucosal barrier failure → bacterial translocation → sepsis).

#### 1.2 Rebleeding

This is the single most important complication to watch for and the **main predictor of mortality** in UGIB.

> ***Signs of recurrence of bleeding:*** [9]
> - ***Haematemesis / fresh melena***
> - ***Tachycardia***
> - ***Falling Hb trend (anaemia)***
> - ***Blood in the NG tube***

Per lecture slides [1]:

> ***After therapeutic endoscopy — close monitoring, look out for rebleeding (first 3 days):***
> - ***Increasing pulse rate***
> - ***Haematemesis***
> - ***Pass fresh melaena again***
> - ***Fresh blood aspirated from nasogastric tube***
> - ***Drop in haemoglobin level***

**Why does rebleeding occur?**
- The endoscopic haemostasis creates a temporary seal (clot, coagulum, clip) — if the clot is lysed by pepsin (at low pH) or dislodged mechanically, the underlying vessel re-opens
- This is why ***IV PPI 80 mg stat then 8 mg/h for 72 hours*** is critical post-endoscopy — maintaining pH > 6 prevents pepsin activation and clot lysis [3]
- Rebleeding is most likely in the **first 72 hours** — hence the intensive monitoring period [1]

**Risk factors for rebleeding** (from earlier sections, repeated here for completeness) [1]:

> ***Risk factors for recurrent bleeding:***
> - ***Shock on presentation***
> - ***Hb < 8.0 g/dL on presentation***
> - ***Transfusion requirement***
> - ***Age > 60 yrs***
> - ***Comorbidity***
> - ***Coagulopathy***
> - ***Patient already hospitalised***
> - ***Large ulcer***
> - ***Ulcer on posterior D1***
> - ***Ulcer on higher posterior lesser curve***

**Management of rebleeding**:
1. Re-resuscitate (ABC)
2. **Repeat OGD** with re-attempt at endoscopic haemostasis — a second endoscopy is reasonable and often successful
3. If the **second endoscopy fails** → escalate to ***surgery*** or ***TAE (transcatheter arterial embolisation)*** [5][9]

#### 1.3 Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| Mechanism | Hypovolaemia → ↓ renal perfusion → **pre-renal AKI** → oliguria, ↑ urea, ↑ creatinine |
| Why urea rises disproportionately | Two reasons: (1) ↓ GFR → ↑ urea reabsorption in proximal tubule. (2) Blood in the GI tract is digested → amino acids absorbed → hepatic urea synthesis ↑. This gives the characteristic ***elevated urea:creatinine ratio > 100:1*** [3] |
| Prevention | Adequate fluid resuscitation, avoid nephrotoxins (NSAIDs, contrast dye if possible) |
| Management | Volume restoration; if progresses to ATN (acute tubular necrosis from prolonged ischaemia), may require renal replacement therapy |

#### 1.4 Myocardial Ischaemia / Infarction

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| Mechanism | ↓ Haemoglobin → ↓ oxygen-carrying capacity → **demand ischaemia** in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease. The heart needs to work harder (compensatory tachycardia) with less oxygen available |
| Who is at risk | Elderly patients, those with IHD, aortic stenosis |
| Recognition | New chest pain, ECG changes (ST depression/elevation), troponin rise |
| Prevention | This is why the transfusion threshold is ***Hb < 9 g/dL in high-risk patients (e.g. elderly, CAD)*** rather than the standard Hb < 7 [2] |

#### 1.5 Aspiration Pneumonia

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| Mechanism | Massive haematemesis → blood pools in the oropharynx → aspiration into the tracheobronchial tree → chemical pneumonitis → secondary bacterial infection |
| Who is at risk | Patients with impaired consciousness (hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotics, severe shock), elderly, those without a protected airway |
| Prevention | ***Cuffed ET tube*** for airway protection in patients with massive haematemesis or GCS ≤ 8 [3]. Semi-upright positioning. NG decompression |
| Management | Broad-spectrum antibiotics, physiotherapy, mechanical ventilation if severe |

#### 1.6 Hepatic Encephalopathy (in Cirrhotics)

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| Mechanism | Blood in the GI tract is a massive **protein load** → bacterial breakdown produces **ammonia** → cirrhotic liver cannot clear ammonia (impaired urea cycle) → ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier → astrocyte swelling + altered neurotransmission → confusion, asterixis, coma |
| Why UGIB specifically triggers it | 250 mL of blood in the gut = ~50 g of protein = enormous ammonia production. Combined with impaired hepatic clearance in cirrhosis, this is a potent trigger |
| Recognition | Confusion, asterixis (liver flap), fetor hepaticus, drowsiness progressing to coma |
| Management | Lactulose (osmotic laxative → acidifies colonic lumen → traps NH₄⁺ → increases faecal ammonia excretion), rifaximin (non-absorbable antibiotic → reduces ammonia-producing gut bacteria), NG tube to remove blood from the stomach |

#### 1.7 Iron-Deficiency Anaemia (Chronic/Occult UGIB)

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| Mechanism | Chronic slow blood loss (e.g. from erosive gastritis, Cameron lesions, angiodysplasia, occult malignancy) → gradual depletion of iron stores → microcytic hypochromic anaemia |
| Why iron specifically | Each mL of blood lost = ~0.5 mg of iron. The body has limited iron absorption capacity (~1–2 mg/day). Chronic losses exceeding absorption → iron stores depleted → haemoglobin synthesis impaired |
| Recognition | Fatigue, pallor, glossitis, koilonychia (spoon nails), pica. Lab: ↓ Hb, ↓ MCV, ↓ ferritin, ↑ TIBC |
| Significance | Iron-deficiency anaemia in any adult should prompt investigation for GI malignancy (upper AND lower GI endoscopy) — it may be the **only presenting feature** of an occult gastric or oesophageal cancer [9] |

### 2. Complications of the Underlying Disease

These are complications of the specific pathology causing the UGIB, not of the bleeding per se.

#### 2.1 Peptic Ulcer Disease — Complications Beyond Bleeding

PUD has **four classic complications** — bleeding is just one of them. A patient presenting with UGIB from PUD is also at risk of the other three:

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Features | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Bleeding** (most common) | Ulcer erodes into a submucosal/mural artery (***posterior D1 → GDA; lesser curve → left gastric artery***) | Haematemesis, melena, shock. ***Leading cause of death of peptic ulcer*** [5] | Endoscopic dual therapy → IV PPI 72h → surgery/TAE if fails [9] |
| **Perforation** | Ulcer erodes through the **full thickness** of the bowel wall → free communication with peritoneal cavity. ***MC site: anterior wall of D1*** [5] | ***Sudden onset severe generalised abdominal pain*** (can pinpoint exact onset time). ***Board-like rigidity***. CXR: ***pneumoperitoneum (free gas under diaphragm in 60–70%)*** [5] | NPO, IV fluids, NG decompression, IV antibiotics, ***IV PPI. Do NOT perform OGD*** (may convert sealed perforation to real perforation) [5]. Surgery: omental patch repair (Graham patch) ± vagotomy + pyloroplasty |
| **Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO)** | Acute: inflammation → **oedema and duodenal spasm**. Chronic: **fibrosis and scarring** from repeated ulceration → narrowing of pylorus/duodenum [9] | Epigastric pain after eating, ***early satiety, vomiting of undigested food, succussion splash***. Metabolic: ***hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis*** (loss of HCl from vomiting) ± ***paradoxical aciduria*** (secondary hyperaldosteronism → H⁺/K⁺ exchange in kidneys) [5] | NPO, NG decompression ("drip and suck"), IV fluids + KCl, IV PPI. Endoscopic balloon dilatation ± stenting. Surgery: vagotomy + antrectomy + Billroth reconstruction [9] |
| **Penetration** | Ulcer erodes **into an adjacent organ** without free perforation into the peritoneal cavity. ***Order of frequency: pancreas > lesser omentum > biliary tract > liver > greater omentum > colon > vascular structures*** [9] | Change in pain pattern: more intense, longer duration, shift from vague visceral discomfort to **localised intense pain radiating to the back** (pancreatic penetration). NOT relieved by food or antacids [9] | Medical management (PPI, H. pylori eradication). ***Surgery NOT recommended*** for penetration alone [9] |

<Callout title="Perforation vs Bleeding — Anatomical Logic">
**Anterior** D1 ulcers tend to **perforate** — because anteriorly there is only the peritoneal cavity, so the ulcer breaks through into free space. **Posterior** D1 ulcers tend to **bleed** — because posteriorly lies the GDA, so the ulcer erodes into a major artery before reaching the retroperitoneum. This anterior-perforation / posterior-bleeding pattern is a classic exam point [5][9].
</Callout>

#### 2.2 Variceal Bleeding — Complications Specific to Cirrhosis

Patients with variceal bleeding are cirrhotic, and the bleed itself triggers a cascade of liver-specific complications:

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Hepatic encephalopathy** | Blood protein → ammonia (as above) | Lactulose, rifaximin, NG aspiration of blood |
| **Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)** | Gut bacterial translocation (↑ during variceal bleeding from mucosal hypoperfusion) + impaired hepatic reticuloendothelial clearance → bacteria seed ascitic fluid | ***IV ceftriaxone 1g daily for 7 days*** (prophylactic) [3] |
| **Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)** | Splanchnic vasodilation (portal hypertension) → ↓ effective circulating volume → renal vasoconstriction → functional renal failure with no structural renal damage | IV terlipressin + albumin. TIPSS. Liver transplant (definitive) |
| **Coagulopathy** | ↓ Hepatic synthesis of clotting factors (II, V, VII, IX, X) + thrombocytopenia from hypersplenism + possible DIC | FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate. IV vitamin K (limited benefit in parenchymal disease) [2] |

#### 2.3 Malignancy

An underlying upper GI malignancy (gastric cancer, oesophageal cancer) causing UGIB carries the additional risk of:
- **Gastric outlet obstruction** — tumour mass occludes pylorus/duodenum [9]
- **Perforation** — tumour necrosis → full-thickness bowel wall breakdown → peritonitis [9]
- **Metastatic spread** — by the time a tumour bleeds, it may already be locally advanced or metastatic
- **Iron-deficiency anaemia** — chronic occult blood loss is often the presenting feature of GI malignancy

### 3. Complications of Treatment

#### 3.1 Complications of OGD [13]

> ***Complications of OGD:*** [13]

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Pre-operative (sedation-related)** | ***Cardiopulmonary complications*** (***most frequent***): ***hypoxaemia, respiratory depression, aspiration pneumonia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, AMI*** [13] | Sedatives (midazolam, propofol) depress respiratory drive and lower BP. Aspiration risk if stomach full of blood |
| **Intraoperative** | ***Perforation*** | Risk increased with therapeutic manoeuvres (dilatation, EMR/ESD) and in patients with ***oesophageal diverticula***. Insufflation of air can also perforate a weakened/ulcerated wall [13] |
| | ***Bleeding*** | Biopsy sites, post-polypectomy, thermal injury to vessel during haemostasis |
| **Post-operative** | ***Delayed bleeding*** (***typically 5–7 days***) | ***Sloughing of an eschar covering a blood vessel*** or ***extension of zone of thermal necrosis to non-injured tissues → bleeding if it involves a blood vessel*** [13] |
| | Post-banding ulcers (after EBL for varices) | Band strangulates tissue → necrosis → ulcer at banding site → can bleed. Managed with oral PPI [3] |

<Callout title="Delayed Post-Endoscopy Bleeding" type="error">
A patient who had endoscopic haemostasis and was doing well suddenly rebleeds on day 5–7. This is ***delayed bleeding*** — the thermal coagulation creates an eschar (scab), which sloughs off as the tissue heals, unroofing the underlying vessel. This is distinct from rebleeding in the first 72h (which is failure of initial haemostasis). It requires re-endoscopy and repeat therapy [13].
</Callout>

#### 3.2 Complications of Histoacryl Glue Injection (for Gastric Varices) [3]

> ***Complications of Histoacryl glue:*** ***ulceration, stricture, mediastinitis, obviates use of subsequent EBL*** [3]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **Ulceration** | Glue polymerises and forms a hard cast → mechanical irritation of adjacent mucosa → ulceration |
| **Stricture** | Inflammatory reaction from glue → fibrosis → luminal narrowing |
| **Mediastinitis** | If glue injected too superficially or perforates the oesophageal/gastric wall → mediastinal contamination |
| **Systemic embolisation** | Glue can travel through the varix into the systemic venous circulation → pulmonary embolism or even cerebral embolism (if PFO present). This is the most feared complication |
| **Obviates subsequent EBL** | The hardened glue mass changes the tissue architecture → banding becomes technically impossible |

#### 3.3 Complications of Sengstaken-Blakemore Tube [12]

> ***Complications of SB tube:*** [12]
> - ***Pressure necrosis*** (deflate after 12h and re-inflate if ongoing bleed)
> - ***Oesophageal perforation***
> - ***Bleeding, pain***

- **Why pressure necrosis?** The inflated balloons exert sustained pressure on the oesophageal/gastric wall → mucosal ischaemia → necrosis. Maximum inflation time is **12 hours** before deflation is mandatory
- **Why oesophageal perforation?** If the oesophageal balloon migrates into the pharynx and is still inflated → mechanical rupture. Or if inflated in a weakened oesophagus (stricture, recent surgery). ***Confirm position by CXR*** before inflation [12]

#### 3.4 Complications of Surgery

##### Post-Gastrectomy Complications (after surgery for bleeding GU/DU or gastric cancer) [14][5]

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Immediate** | Bleeding, injury to nearby organs (pancreas, duodenum, spleen) | Operative technical complications |
| **Early** | Anastomotic leak (***typically POD 5–10***) [14] | Failure of surgical anastomosis to heal → enteric contents leak into peritoneal cavity → peritonitis, sepsis |
| | Duodenal stump blowout (after Billroth II) | Duodenal stump closure fails → bilious/enteric leak → severe sepsis |
| | Wound infection, chest infection, post-op ileus | Standard post-operative complications |
| **Late** | **Dumping syndrome** | Early: rapid delivery of hyperosmolar chyme into small bowel → fluid shift into lumen → hypovolaemia + distension → vasomotor symptoms (30 min post-meal). Late: rapid carbohydrate absorption → hyperglycaemia → excessive insulin release → reactive hypoglycaemia (1–3h post-meal) |
| | **Bile reflux gastritis** | Loss of pylorus → bile refluxes into gastric remnant → chronic gastritis |
| | **Afferent loop syndrome** (Billroth II/Roux-en-Y) | Obstruction of the afferent limb → accumulation of bile/pancreatic secretions → distension, pain, bilious vomiting [14] |
| | **Nutritional deficiencies** | Vitamin B12 deficiency (loss of intrinsic factor from parietal cells), iron deficiency (↓ acid → ↓ iron absorption), calcium/vitamin D malabsorption |
| | **Marginal (stomal) ulcer** | Acid from gastric remnant acts on unprotected jejunal mucosa at the anastomotic site |
| | **Gastric stump cancer** | Long-term bile reflux → chronic atrophic gastritis → intestinal metaplasia → dysplasia → carcinoma (risk increases > 15 years post-gastrectomy) |

##### Post-Vagotomy Complications [9]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **Gastroparesis / Delayed gastric emptying** | Truncal vagotomy denervates the pylorus → loss of coordinated gastric motility → food stasis (this is why **pyloroplasty** is always added as a drainage procedure) |
| **Diarrhoea** | Vagal denervation of small bowel → rapid transit → malabsorption → osmotic diarrhoea (occurs in ~20% post-truncal vagotomy) |
| **Dumping syndrome** | Combined effect of vagotomy + pyloroplasty → loss of pyloric regulation → rapid gastric emptying |

#### 3.5 Complications of TAE (Transcatheter Arterial Embolisation) [9]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **Rebleeding** | Collateral arterial flow reconstitutes after embolisation → re-perfuses the bleeding vessel |
| **Bowel ischaemia** | Non-selective embolisation occludes end-arteries supplying bowel segments → ischaemic necrosis. Risk ~20% with standard technique, reduced to 3–4% with ***super-selective embolisation*** |
| **Contrast nephropathy** | Iodinated contrast → direct tubular toxicity + renal vasoconstriction → AKI |
| **Femoral haematoma / dissection** | Vascular access site complication |
| **Post-embolisation syndrome** | Pain, fever, nausea — inflammatory response to tissue ischaemia |

#### 3.6 Complications of TIPSS

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **Hepatic encephalopathy** (most significant) | The shunt diverts portal blood (laden with gut-derived ammonia) directly into the systemic circulation, bypassing the liver → ↑ systemic ammonia → encephalopathy. Occurs in ~30% of patients |
| **Shunt stenosis / thrombosis** | Neointimal hyperplasia or thrombus within the stent → reduced shunt patency → recurrent portal hypertension → rebleeding. Managed with shunt revision/dilatation |
| **Heart failure** | Sudden ↑ venous return (the shunt dumps large volume into the systemic circulation) → volume overload → cardiac decompensation (especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease) |

#### 3.7 Complications of PPI Therapy (Long-term)

While IV PPI for 72 hours is unlikely to cause problems, many UGIB patients are placed on **long-term oral PPI** for secondary prophylaxis. Complications of chronic PPI use include:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **C. difficile infection** | ↑ Gastric pH → loss of acid barrier → altered gut microbiome → C. diff colonisation |
| **Community-acquired pneumonia** | ↑ Gastric pH → bacterial colonisation of stomach → micro-aspiration |
| **Hypomagnesaemia** | Impaired intestinal magnesium absorption (mechanism incompletely understood) |
| **Bone fractures** | ↓ Calcium absorption (calcium salts need acid for dissolution) → ↓ bone mineral density |
| **Vitamin B12 deficiency** | Acid is needed to release B12 from food proteins; PPI reduces this |
| **Rebound acid hypersecretion** | Chronic PPI → compensatory ↑ gastrin → parietal cell hyperplasia → on withdrawal, ↑↑ acid secretion |
| **Fundic gland polyps** | Chronic acid suppression → cystic dilation of fundic glands (benign, but can be mistaken for neoplastic polyps) |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of UGIB">

**Rebleeding** is the most dangerous complication and the main predictor of mortality. Watch for it in the first 72 hours (↑ pulse, haematemesis, fresh melena, blood in NG tube, ↓ Hb). Risk factors: shock on presentation, Hb < 8, age > 60, posterior D1 ulcer, large ulcer, coagulopathy.

**Anterior D1 ulcers perforate; posterior D1 ulcers bleed** — anatomical logic (anterior = peritoneal cavity; posterior = GDA).

**PUD has 4 complications**: Bleeding (MC cause of PUD death), perforation, GOO, penetration.

**Cirrhotic patients** with variceal bleeding are at risk of hepatic encephalopathy (blood = protein load → ammonia), SBP (bacterial translocation), HRS, and coagulopathy.

**OGD complications**: sedation (most frequent = cardiopulmonary), perforation, delayed bleeding at POD 5–7 from eschar sloughing.

**Histoacryl glue**: ulceration, stricture, mediastinitis, systemic embolisation, prevents future EBL.

**SB tube**: pressure necrosis (deflate after 12h), oesophageal perforation.

**TIPSS**: hepatic encephalopathy (~30%), shunt stenosis, heart failure from volume overload.

**Long-term PPI**: C. diff, pneumonia, hypomagnesaemia, fractures, B12 deficiency.
