## Complications of Gallbladder Cancer

Complications of GBC can be organised into three major categories:

1. **Complications of the disease itself** (from tumour growth and spread)
2. **Complications of surgical treatment** (from cholecystectomy and extended resection)
3. **Complications of palliative interventions** (from stenting, PTBD, and chemotherapy)

Understanding these from first principles means linking each complication back to the anatomy, the natural history of GBC, and the specific physiological insults of each treatment.

---

### I. Complications of the Disease Itself

These arise from the **local invasion**, **biliary obstruction**, **metastatic spread**, and **systemic effects** of GBC.

#### A. Obstructive Jaundice and Its Sequelae

GBC causes biliary obstruction by three mechanisms (cystic duct LN compression, direct CBD infiltration, tumour fragments) [8]. Once bile flow is obstructed, a cascade of complications follows:

| Complication | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia / Jaundice** | Bile cannot drain into duodenum → conjugated bilirubin refluxes into blood → deposits in skin, sclera (visible when bilirubin > 35 µmol/L) |
| **Pruritus** | Bile salts normally excreted in bile accumulate in blood → deposit in skin → stimulate cutaneous nerve endings. Severe, intractable pruritus significantly impairs quality of life |
| **Dark urine / Pale stools** | Conjugated bilirubin (water-soluble) excreted by kidneys → dark "tea-coloured" urine. No bilirubin reaching gut → no stercobilinogen → pale/clay stools |
| ***Coagulopathy*** | No bile salts in the gut → cannot emulsify dietary fat → impaired absorption of **fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)**. ***Vitamin K deficiency → impaired hepatic synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, X → prolonged PT/INR → bleeding tendency*** [1][10][22] |
| ***Malabsorption and malnutrition*** | Fat malabsorption → steatorrhoea (floating, foul-smelling, pale, greasy stools). Also: loss of fat-soluble vitamins → Vitamin A deficiency (night blindness), Vitamin D deficiency (osteomalacia/osteoporosis), Vitamin E deficiency (neuropathy) [22] |
| ***Immune dysfunction*** | Cholestasis impairs reticuloendothelial system function and cell-mediated immunity. The liver normally clears endotoxin from portal blood; in obstructive jaundice, this clearance is impaired → endotoxaemia → increased susceptibility to sepsis [10][22] |
| **Renal failure** | Conjugated bilirubin and bile salts are directly nephrotoxic. Also: endotoxaemia in cholestatic patients causes renal vasoconstriction → hepatorenal physiology. Studies from the 1980s showed ***higher rates of renal failure in jaundiced patients undergoing surgery*** [22] |

> The lecture slide summarises these consequences neatly: ***"Jaundice → coagulopathy, malabsorption, malnutrition and immune dysfunction"*** [22]

#### B. Biliary Sepsis (Acute Cholangitis)

- When bile stasis occurs proximal to a malignant obstruction, the stagnant bile becomes a fertile medium for bacterial growth
- Bacteria ascend from the duodenum or reach the bile via the portal circulation
- Common organisms: **E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterococcus faecalis** (same as for any cholangitis)
- Presents as **Charcot's triad** (fever + jaundice + RUQ pain) or **Reynolds' pentad** (adds hypotension + altered mental status)
- ***Biliary sepsis is one of the leading causes of mortality in MBO*** [23]

<Callout title="Causes of Mortality in MBO" type="error">
The lecture slides explicitly list ***three causes of mortality*** [23]:
1. ***Biliary sepsis*** — infection of obstructed, stagnant bile → bacteraemia → septic shock
2. ***Cancer cachexia*** — tumour-derived cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) → progressive wasting → organ failure
3. ***Liver failure*** — chronic biliary obstruction → secondary biliary cirrhosis → hepatic decompensation; also direct tumour invasion destroying liver parenchyma
</Callout>

#### C. Direct Tumour Invasion — Local Complications

The anatomy of the gallbladder means that as tumour grows, it invades neighbouring structures in a predictable pattern [1]:

| Structure Invaded | Resulting Complication | Why (Anatomical Basis) |
|---|---|---|
| **Liver (Segments IVb, V)** | Hepatic insufficiency, portal hypertension, liver failure | GB body directly adherent to liver via loose connective tissue with no serosa on hepatic side; venous drainage flows directly into these segments |
| **Duodenum (D1/D2)** | ***Gastric outlet obstruction / duodenal obstruction*** → nausea, vomiting, inability to eat | GB body free margin abuts the duodenum inferiorly [1] |
| **Hepatic flexure of colon** | Large bowel obstruction (rare) | GB fundus is anatomically associated with the hepatic flexure [1] |
| **Stomach** | Gastric outlet obstruction; fistula formation (rare) | Proximity of GB body to gastric antrum |
| **Pancreas** | Secondary pancreatitis; exocrine/endocrine insufficiency | Head of pancreas adjacent to distal CBD and duodenum |
| **Extrahepatic bile ducts** | Obstructive jaundice (as discussed above) | Tumour at neck/cystic duct directly infiltrates CHD/CBD |
| ***Hepatoduodenal ligament*** | Portal vein or hepatic artery encasement → portal hypertension → ascites, variceal bleeding | The hepatoduodenal ligament contains the portal triad (portal vein, hepatic artery, CBD); tumour or nodes invading this ligament compromise all three structures |
| **Omentum / Peritoneum** | Peritoneal carcinomatosis → malignant ascites | Transcelomic spread from serosal penetration (T3+) |
| **Abdominal wall** | Tumour nodule in abdominal wall (rare) | Direct invasion through the peritoneum |

#### D. Metastatic Complications

***Sites of distant metastasis include lung, pleura, and peritoneum*** [1]

| Metastatic Site | Complications |
|---|---|
| **Liver** (haematogenous via cystic veins) | Progressive hepatic insufficiency; portal hypertension |
| **Peritoneum** | Malignant ascites (exudative); bowel obstruction from carcinomatosis |
| **Lung and pleura** | Malignant pleural effusion → dyspnoea; pulmonary nodules |
| **Lymph nodes** (para-aortic, celiac, SMA) | Compression of adjacent structures; considered distant metastasis and therefore incurable |
| ***Port-site metastasis*** | Recurrence at trocar sites after prior laparoscopic cholecystectomy — ***port site recurrences and late peritoneal metastasis associated with bile spillage are reported*** [1] |

#### E. Systemic Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Cancer cachexia*** [23] | Tumour-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α/cachectin, IL-1, IL-6) → increased basal metabolic rate + skeletal muscle proteolysis + adipose tissue lipolysis + anorexia. Leads to progressive wasting, weakness, and ultimately multi-organ failure |
| **Venous thromboembolism (VTE)** | Mucin-producing adenocarcinomas (like GBC) activate the coagulation cascade → hypercoagulable state → DVT/PE. Also known as **Trousseau syndrome** (migratory superficial thrombophlebitis) |
| **Anaemia of chronic disease** | Chronic inflammation → hepcidin elevation → iron sequestration in macrophages → functional iron deficiency → normocytic normochromic anaemia |

### II. Complications of Surgical Treatment

These are divided by the specific operation performed.

#### A. Simple Cholecystectomy — Specific Complications [3][24]

Even simple cholecystectomy carries risks. Since GBC requires an **open approach**, the complication profile differs slightly from elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

**Immediate:**
- ***Conversion to open surgery*** (if started laparoscopically — 5% elective, 25% emergency) — ***NOT an indication of failure*** [24]
- GA risks, haemorrhage
- ***Damage to neighbouring structures*** [24]:
  - **Bile duct injury** → bile leakage (the most feared complication of any cholecystectomy)
  - **Cystic artery bleeding**
  - **Duodenal, transverse colon, or hepatic flexure injury** (especially during difficult dissection in inflamed Calot's triangle)

**Early (days to weeks):**

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Biliary leakage*** (from cystic duct stump or duct of Luschka — 0.5%) [24] | Insecure clip on cystic duct stump; or injury to an accessory bile duct (duct of Luschka) draining directly from the liver bed into the gallbladder | Minor: ERCP + stent to reduce transsphincteric pressure gradient → promotes healing. Major: Laparotomy + lavage + Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy [24] |
| ***Bleeding*** | Liver (middle hepatic vein close to GB fossa), cystic artery, trocar site | Haemostasis; may require re-exploration |
| **Post-operative jaundice** | Dropped/missed CBD stones; retained cystic duct stone; bile duct injury | ERCP for stone removal; surgical repair if duct injury |
| **Cholangitis** | Infected retained stone; biliary stasis | Antibiotics + ERCP drainage |
| **Post-operative diarrhoea** | ***Initial uncoordinated excessive bile salt excretion + fat malabsorption*** [24] — without the gallbladder to store and concentrate bile, a larger volume of dilute bile enters the colon continuously | Usually self-limiting; bile salt binders (cholestyramine) if persistent |

**Late (weeks to months):**

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bile duct stricture*** | Ischaemic injury to the bile duct wall during dissection → fibrosis → narrowing | ***Reconstruction ± hepaticojejunostomy*** [24] |
| **Subphrenic abscess** | Infected collection in the subphrenic space from bile/blood leak | Percutaneous drainage + antibiotics [24] |
| ***Post-cholecystectomy syndrome*** | ***Persistent symptoms (biliary colic, diarrhoea) after operation*** [24] — due to sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, retained CBD stones, bile duct stricture, or non-biliary causes (IBS, peptic ulcer) | Investigate with MRCP/ERCP; treat underlying cause |
| **Post-cholecystectomy choledocholithiasis** | ***Bile stasis due to increased CBD calibre (loss of GB storing function)*** [24] → new stone formation in CBD | ERCP stone extraction |

#### B. Extended (Radical) Cholecystectomy — Additional Complications

Extended cholecystectomy adds **liver resection + lymphadenectomy ± bile duct resection**, each contributing specific complications:

| Complication | Mechanism | Relevant to Which Component |
|---|---|---|
| **Haemorrhage** (intra/post-operative) | Liver parenchymal transection → bleeding from hepatic veins, portal vein branches, or raw liver surface | Liver resection |
| ***Bile leak*** | Cut surface of liver (especially gallbladder fossa) has small bile ductules that can leak; also from hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis | Liver resection; bile duct resection |
| ***Anastomotic stricture*** (of Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy) | Fibrosis and scarring at the surgical anastomosis → narrowing → recurrent jaundice, cholangitis | Bile duct resection with reconstruction. ***Routine bile duct resection is NOT associated with survival benefit and has potential serious complications such as bile leak and anastomotic stricture*** [1] |
| **Liver failure / Post-hepatectomy liver failure** | Insufficient future liver remnant (FLR) after resection — the remaining liver cannot sustain synthetic, metabolic, and excretory functions | Liver resection (especially if underlying liver disease or extensive resection) |
| **Subphrenic / Perihepatic abscess** | Infected collection at the liver resection surface or in the subphrenic space | Liver resection |
| **Lymphatic leak / Chylous ascites** | Disruption of lymphatic channels during extensive porta hepatis lymphadenectomy | Lymph node dissection |
| **Portal vein thrombosis** | Endothelial injury during dissection around the portal vein; low flow states post-operatively | Lymph node dissection / vascular manipulation |
| **Wound infection / Dehiscence** | Large right subcostal or chevron incision in a malnourished, jaundiced, immunocompromised patient | Open approach; host factors |

<Callout title="Why Is MBO High Risk for Surgery?" type="idea">
The lecture slides identify ***three key reasons why MBO patients are high-risk surgical candidates*** [19]:
1. ***Cancer cachexia → Malnutrition → Nutritional support needed***
2. ***Liver derangement → Bleeding tendency → IV Vitamin K and FFP during surgery***
3. ***Superimposed biliary infection → Antibiotic cover essential***

These factors all converge to increase the risk of post-operative haemorrhage, infection, poor healing, and organ failure.
</Callout>

#### C. Incidental GBC After Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy — Specific Complications

When GBC is discovered incidentally after laparoscopic cholecystectomy:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Port-site recurrence*** | Tumour cells seed along trocar tracks during laparoscopic GB extraction — reported in 10–20% of incidental GBC cases. This is why port sites must be excised during re-resection [1] |
| ***Peritoneal carcinomatosis*** | Bile spillage during laparoscopic cholecystectomy → tumour-containing bile contaminates the peritoneal cavity → peritoneal metastasis [1] |
| ***Incomplete initial resection*** | Simple laparoscopic cholecystectomy is inadequate for T1b+ disease → residual disease in liver bed and lymph nodes → local and distant recurrence if re-resection is not performed |

---

### III. Complications of Palliative Interventions

#### A. ERCP with Stenting [10][21]

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Stent occlusion*** | ***Sludge, tumour ingrowth (tumour grows through mesh of metallic stent), tumour overgrowth (tumour grows over the ends of stent)*** [10] | ***Sweeping (mechanical cleaning) or placing a new stent through the occluded one*** [21] |
| ***Stent migration*** | Stent shifts position → loss of drainage → recurrent jaundice | Endoscopic retrieval and replacement [21] |
| ***Cholangitis*** | Introduction of bacteria during ERCP; stent becomes a nidus for infection; incomplete drainage | IV antibiotics; stent exchange or drainage |
| **Post-ERCP pancreatitis** | Cannulation-related oedema of the pancreatic duct orifice → obstruction of pancreatic drainage → autodigestion | Conservative (NPO, IVF, analgesia); usually self-limiting |
| **Bleeding** | Sphincterotomy → arterial bleeding from papilla | Endoscopic haemostasis; correct coagulopathy first |
| **Perforation** | Retroduodenal perforation during sphincterotomy; guide wire perforation of bile duct | Surgical repair if large; conservative if contained |
| ***Cholecystitis*** (stent-related) | Metallic stent may cover the cystic duct orifice → bile cannot drain from gallbladder → acute cholecystitis. ***Uncovered stents are preferred*** to reduce this risk [21] | Percutaneous cholecystostomy or cholecystectomy if feasible |

> ***Pre-op biliary drainage has increased risk of serious complications — pancreatitis (7%), cholangitis (26%), blocked stent (15%), bleeding (2%), perforation (2%)*** [22]

#### B. PTBD [10]

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bleeding*** | ***Common due to puncture of hepatic artery or portal vein before reaching the bile duct (portal triad)*** [10] | ***Stabilise and resuscitate → Clamp the PTBD catheter → Perform cholangiogram to determine if catheter is in hepatic artery or portal vein → Remove catheter slowly*** (do NOT remove immediately — converts to free haemoperitoneum) [10] |
| **Bacteraemia / Sepsis** | Introducing bacteria during the procedure; manipulation of an infected obstructed system | Prophylactic antibiotics before procedure |
| **Haemobilia** | Hepatic artery branch fistula to bile duct from catheter trauma | Angiographic embolisation |
| ***Electrolyte and fluid loss*** | ***Simple external PTBD is prone to electrolyte and fluid loss due to bile output*** [10] — bile contains Na+, K+, HCO3−, Cl−. Losing ~500–1000 mL bile daily causes dehydration and metabolic acidosis | IVF replacement; convert to internal-external drainage |
| **Catheter dislodgement** | Accidental pull-out | Re-insertion; consider internal stenting |
| **Bile peritonitis** | Bile leaks around catheter insertion site into peritoneal cavity | Catheter adjustment; percutaneous drain; laparotomy if severe |

#### C. Chemotherapy-Related Complications

| Agent | Key Toxicities | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Gemcitabine** | Myelosuppression (neutropaenia, thrombocytopaenia), nausea, hepatotoxicity, flu-like symptoms | Nucleoside analogue → inhibits DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells (bone marrow, GI mucosa) |
| **Cisplatin** | Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, severe nausea | Platinum cross-links DNA; accumulates in renal tubular cells |
| **Capecitabine** | Hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia), diarrhoea, mucositis | Oral prodrug of 5-FU; activated preferentially in tumour tissue but also affects skin and GI mucosa |
| **Durvalumab** (immune checkpoint inhibitor) | Immune-related adverse events: pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, thyroiditis, adrenalitis | PD-L1 blockade → unleashes T-cell activity → autoimmune inflammation in various organs |

---

### IV. Disease Recurrence After Curative Resection

Even after apparently curative R0 resection, GBC has a high recurrence rate:

| Pattern of Recurrence | Mechanism | Detection |
|---|---|---|
| **Local recurrence** (liver bed, porta hepatis) | Microscopic residual disease at resection margins; perineural invasion | CT/MRI; rising CA 19-9 |
| **Peritoneal recurrence** | Transcoelomic dissemination (especially if there was bile spillage at index operation) | CT; diagnostic laparoscopy |
| **Distant recurrence** (lung, bone) | Haematogenous spread via cystic veins → systemic circulation | CT thorax; bone scan; PET/CT |
| **Port-site recurrence** | Tumour seeding during prior laparoscopic surgery | Clinical examination; CT of abdominal wall |

**Serial CA 19-9 monitoring** after resection can aid in detection of persistent or recurrent disease — a rising trend is concerning even if imaging is negative [1]
