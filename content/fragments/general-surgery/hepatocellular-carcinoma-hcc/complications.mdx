## Complications of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

HCC is a disease that kills through multiple, often overlapping pathways. The complications arise from three interconnected sources: **(A) the tumour itself** (local effects, spread, rupture), **(B) the underlying chronic liver disease/cirrhosis** (which is present in 80% of HCC patients in HK), and **(C) treatment-related complications**. Let's work through each systematically, explaining the "why" from first principles.

---

### 1. Complications of the Tumour Itself

#### 1.1 ***Ruptured HCC*** — The Surgical Emergency [1][2][4]

This is the single most dramatic and life-threatening complication of HCC. ***Rupture occurs in 5–10% of HCC patients*** [2] and carries a ***mortality of 25–100%*** [2].

**Pathogenesis** [2]:
- ***Tend to occur in large and peripherally located tumours*** — subcapsular tumours have less surrounding parenchyma to contain them
- ***Increased intra-tumoural pressure with occlusion of hepatic veins by tumour thrombi or invasion*** — venous outflow obstruction raises pressure within the tumour, like a balloon with a blocked outlet
- ***Rapid tumour growth and necrosis*** — the tumour outgrows its blood supply, leading to central necrosis with softening and structural weakness
- ***Vascular dysfunction → friable vessels*** — HCC neoangiogenesis produces structurally abnormal, thin-walled vessels that lack the smooth muscle and elastic layers of normal vessels; these are prone to spontaneous rupture

**Clinical features** [1][2]:
- ***Leads to intraperitoneal haemorrhage*** [1]
- ***Presents with severe abdominal pain with peritoneal signs and shock*** [1]
- ***Sudden onset of epigastric pain with abdominal distension*** [2]
- ***Hypovolaemic shock*** — tachycardia, hypotension, pallor, diaphoresis, altered consciousness
- ***Increased likelihood of peritoneal seeding*** [2] — rupture exposes tumour cells directly to the peritoneal cavity, dramatically increasing the risk of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Even patients who survive the acute event face a much worse long-term prognosis.

**Management** [1][2][4]:
- ***Treatment of choice is transarterial embolisation (TAE)*** [1][4] — if portal vein is patent and liver function is reasonable
- ***Uncontrolled bleeding should proceed directly to laparotomy*** [1][4]:
  - Perihepatic packing + suture plication
  - Absolute alcohol injection
  - Selective hepatic artery ligation (HAL)
  - Staged liver resection

<Callout title="Ruptured HCC — Why Is Mortality So High?">
Three reasons compound each other: (1) the patient is already cirrhotic with impaired coagulation (↓ clotting factors + thrombocytopenia from hypersplenism), so bleeding is harder to control; (2) haemorrhagic shock further damages the already compromised liver (ischaemic hepatitis); (3) the underlying HCC is usually large and advanced if it has ruptured, limiting definitive treatment options even after haemostasis.
</Callout>

#### 1.2 Portal Vein Tumour Thrombus (PVTT)

***HCC is a vascular tumour with a high propensity for venous invasion (portal and hepatic veins)*** [4]. Portal vein tumour thrombus is found in **30–60%** of HCC patients at diagnosis or during disease course.

**Why does HCC invade the portal vein?**
- HCC grows into the path of least resistance. The portal vein branches run through the liver parenchyma immediately adjacent to hepatocytes. Malignant hepatocytes can directly invade through the thin sinusoidal walls into portal venule tributaries, then grow "upstream" along the portal vein like ivy growing along a pipe.

**Consequences of PVTT** (each explained from first principles):

| Consequence | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Worsened portal hypertension** | Tumour thrombus physically obstructs portal venous flow → ↑ portal venous pressure → worsened ascites, oesophageal/gastric varices, splenomegaly |
| **Variceal bleeding** | ↑ Portal pressure → portosystemic collaterals dilate further → varices enlarge → risk of catastrophic UGIB |
| **Hepatic decompensation** | Portal vein supplies ~75% of hepatic blood flow. Obstruction → ischaemic injury to non-tumorous hepatocytes → accelerated liver failure |
| **Contraindication to TACE** | If portal vein is blocked, the non-tumorous liver depends entirely on hepatic artery. Embolising the artery (TACE) → total ischaemia → liver death [1] |
| **Worse prognosis** | PVTT indicates ***early IV spread*** [1] with circulating tumour cells → high risk of intrahepatic and distant metastasis |

#### 1.3 Hepatic Vein / IVC Invasion

***Spread through hepatic vein branches and spread to IVC, right heart and lungs*** [1][4].

- Tumour can grow as a "tongue" of tissue extending from hepatic veins into the IVC and even into the right atrium
- **Budd-Chiari-like syndrome**: hepatic venous outflow obstruction → hepatic congestion, worsened ascites, hepatomegaly
- **Right atrial tumour extension**: can cause acute right heart obstruction → cardiogenic shock, sudden death
- **Pulmonary tumour embolism**: tumour fragments can embolise to the lungs → acute dyspnoea, right heart failure

#### 1.4 ***Metastatic Disease*** [1][3][4]

***Spread of HCC*** [3]:
- ***Local invasion: portal vein, hepatic vein, bile duct***
- ***Lymphatic spread: one quarter of patients***
- ***Transperitoneal spread: rare***
- ***Haematogenous spread: lung and bone***

| Metastatic Site | Mechanism | Clinical Consequences |
|---|---|---|
| ***Intrahepatic metastasis*** [4] | ***Via portal venous circulation*** — tumour cells shed into portal vein branches and seed distant segments | Multiple new tumour nodules; the most common pattern of spread; responsible for high post-resection recurrence |
| ***Lung*** [1][3][4] | ***Via hepatic vein dissemination*** — tumour cells enter hepatic veins → IVC → right heart → pulmonary arteries | ***Secondaries in lung*** [3]: cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, pleural effusion |
| ***Bone*** [1][3] | Haematogenous via systemic circulation | ***Secondaries in bone*** [3]: pain, pathological fractures, cord compression; osteolytic lesions on imaging |
| ***Lymph nodes (porta hepatis)*** [1] | Direct lymphatic drainage from liver hilum | May cause obstructive jaundice if compressing the CBD |
| ***Peritoneum*** [4] | ***Peritoneal metastasis*** — especially after spontaneous rupture of HCC or transperitoneal seeding during interventions | Malignant ascites (bloody, exudative); peritoneal carcinomatosis |
| ***Adrenals*** [1] | Haematogenous | Usually asymptomatic; rarely bilateral adrenal insufficiency |
| **Brain** | Haematogenous (rare) | Headache, focal neurological deficits, seizures |

<Callout title="Why Does Death Usually Precede Extensive Metastasis?">
***Usually death precedes extensive metastasis*** [1]. This is a key exam point. Unlike many solid cancers where metastatic burden is the cause of death, in HCC the **underlying liver failure** (from cirrhosis + tumour burden replacing hepatic parenchyma) typically kills the patient before metastases have time to become clinically dominant. The liver is just too critical an organ — lose it and you lose everything.
</Callout>

#### 1.5 Biliary Invasion

***Local invasion into bile duct*** [3]:
- HCC can invade the biliary tree causing obstructive jaundice (though this is NOT common [2])
- **Haemobilia** — tumour eroding into bile ducts causes bleeding into the biliary system → melaena, jaundice, RUQ pain (Quincke's triad)
- Biliary obstruction can precipitate **ascending cholangitis** (Charcot's triad: fever, jaundice, RUQ pain)

#### 1.6 Paraneoplastic Syndromes

These were covered extensively in the Clinical Features section but represent a category of "complications" in their own right:

- ***Hypoglycaemia*** — can be severe and recurrent, causing seizures, LOC, and even death if not recognised. Occurs via IGF-2 secretion and high metabolic tumour demand [2][3]
- ***Hypercalcaemia*** — via PTHrP secretion; can cause cardiac arrhythmias, delirium, renal failure [2][3][4]
- ***Erythrocytosis*** — secondary polycythaemia from ectopic EPO; increases blood viscosity → risk of thrombosis [2][4]
- ***Diarrhoea*** — from VIP secretion; causes dehydration and electrolyte derangement [2][3]

---

### 2. Complications of the Underlying Liver Disease (Cirrhosis)

Since ***80–100% of HCC patients have underlying cirrhosis*** [1], the complications of cirrhosis run in parallel with — and are worsened by — the tumour. HCC accelerates cirrhotic decompensation through several mechanisms:
- **Mass effect** replacing functioning hepatic parenchyma → ↓ functional reserve
- **Portal vein invasion** → worsened portal hypertension
- **Increased metabolic demands** of the tumour → metabolic stress on the failing liver

#### 2.1 Portal Hypertension and Its Sequelae

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| ***Ascites*** [4] | ↑ Portal venous pressure (hydrostatic) + ↓ albumin (↓ oncotic pressure) + splanchnic vasodilation activating RAAS (Na⁺/H₂O retention) + PVTT worsening outflow obstruction |
| ***Variceal bleeding*** [4] | Portal HT → portosystemic collaterals (oesophageal, gastric, rectal) → varices → rupture → massive UGIB. HCC + PVTT dramatically increases variceal pressure. |
| **Splenomegaly / Hypersplenism** | Splenic congestion from portal HT → splenomegaly → ↑ sequestration and destruction of blood cells → pancytopenia (↓ Hb, ↓ WBC, ↓ Plt) [2] |
| **Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)** [2] | Extreme splanchnic vasodilation (mediated by NO) → ↓ effective circulating volume → renal vasoconstriction → oliguric renal failure. Type 1 HRS (rapidly progressive) carries > 80% mortality within 2 weeks without transplant. |

#### 2.2 ***Hepatic Encephalopathy*** [4]

***Decompensation of cirrhosis: ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy*** [4].

- The cirrhotic liver cannot adequately clear ammonia (from GI bacterial metabolism and deamination of amino acids)
- Ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier → astrocytes convert it to glutamine (via glutamine synthetase) → ↑ intracellular osmolality → astrocyte swelling → cerebral oedema → altered consciousness
- HCC worsens this by: (a) further reducing functional hepatic mass, (b) portal vein thrombosis creating more portosystemic shunting of ammonia-rich blood
- Precipitants in HCC patients: GI bleeding (blood = protein load in gut → ↑ ammonia production), infection (SBP), constipation, sedatives

#### 2.3 Coagulopathy

- The cirrhotic liver has ↓ synthesis of clotting factors (II, V, VII, IX, X, fibrinogen) AND ↓ synthesis of anticoagulant proteins (protein C, S, antithrombin)
- Thrombocytopenia from hypersplenism compounds this
- Result: "rebalanced" haemostasis that is fragile — patients can bleed OR clot unpredictably
- In the context of HCC: surgery, biopsy, or ruptured HCC can provoke life-threatening haemorrhage

#### 2.4 Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)

- Cirrhotic ascites provides a culture medium for bacteria; impaired hepatic reticuloendothelial function (↓ Kupffer cell activity) fails to clear portal bacteraemia
- Presents with fever, abdominal pain, worsening ascites, encephalopathy
- Diagnosis: ascitic fluid PMN ≥ 250/mm³
- Common in HCC patients because they often have refractory ascites requiring frequent paracentesis (entry point for infection)

### 3. Treatment-Related Complications

#### 3.1 Post-Hepatectomy Complications [1][2]

| Complication | Definition / Mechanism | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| ***Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF)*** | ***Impairment in the liver's ability to maintain its synthetic, excretory, and detoxifying functions characterised by ↑ INR and hyperbilirubinaemia after post-operative day 5*** [1]. ***Day 5 bilirubin > 50 µmol/L AND INR > 1.7 ("50-50 rule") = high risk*** [2]. | ***Cirrhotic patients have 2× higher risk than non-cirrhotic patients*** [1]. Prevented by ensuring ***sufficient FLR*** [1]. The most feared complication of hepatic resection. |
| ***Bile leakage*** | ***Drain bilirubin concentration ≥ 3× serum bilirubin on or after post-op Day 3*** [1][2]. Occurs when small bile ducts on the raw cut surface are not adequately sealed. | May require ERCP with sphincterotomy/stenting or percutaneous drainage |
| ***Ischaemic damage to liver remnant*** | ***Prolonged rotation → twisting of inflow and outflow pedicles*** [1][2]. During mobilisation, the remnant liver can rotate on its vascular pedicle, kinking the hepatic artery, portal vein, and/or hepatic vein. | Prevented by careful fixation of the remnant; may require re-operation |
| ***Portal vein and hepatic artery thrombosis*** | ***Uncommon but serious complication due to technical issues during operation*** [1]. Low-flow states post-resection, vessel wall injury, or hypercoagulability. | Can cause acute liver failure; requires urgent anticoagulation or thrombectomy |
| **Subphrenic abscess / collection** | Infected fluid collection in the dead space left after resection | Fever, ↑ WCC; requires percutaneous drainage + antibiotics |
| **Pleural effusion** | Right-sided effusion is common after right hepatectomy (diaphragmatic irritation + post-surgical inflammation) | Usually self-limiting; may need thoracocentesis if large |

***Overall post-hepatectomy outcomes*** [1][4][11]:
- ***Operative mortality: 1–5%***
- ***Morbidity: ~30%***
- ***5-year recurrence rate: ~50%*** — due to ***"field cancerisation"*** effect [1][4]

#### 3.2 Post-Transplantation Complications [2]

| Complication | Mechanism / Details |
|---|---|
| ***Graft failure*** [2] | Primary non-function (graft never works) or early allograft dysfunction; requires urgent re-transplantation |
| ***Acute and chronic rejection*** [2] | T-cell mediated immune attack on the donor liver despite immunosuppression; acute rejection (days–weeks) vs chronic ductopenic rejection (months–years) |
| ***Hepatic artery thrombosis*** [2] | The hepatic artery is an end-artery for the biliary system (bile ducts depend on arterial supply, unlike hepatocytes which have dual supply). Thrombosis → biliary ischaemia → ischaemic cholangiopathy → graft loss |
| ***Portal vein thrombosis, IVC obstruction*** [2] | Technical vascular complications at the anastomotic sites |
| ***Immunosuppression-related complications*** [2] | ***Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, osteoporosis, opportunistic infections*** — the price of preventing rejection. Tacrolimus/cyclosporine cause nephrotoxicity, new-onset diabetes, neurotoxicity. |
| **HCC recurrence** | Even within Milan criteria, recurrence in the graft occurs in ~10–15% at 5 years. AFP > 1000 pre-transplant is a risk factor. |
| **De novo malignancy** | Long-term immunosuppression increases risk of skin cancers, PTLD (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, EBV-related), and other solid tumours |

#### 3.3 Post-Ablation (RFA) Complications [2]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Bile duct injury*** [2] | Thermal energy damages the biliary epithelium → stricture or biliary leak. Particularly problematic for centrally located tumours near the hilum. |
| ***Thermal injury to surrounding tissues*** [2] | Damage to adjacent structures: diaphragm (→ diaphragmatic perforation, pneumothorax), bowel, gallbladder |
| **Liver abscess** | Necrotic tumour tissue becomes secondarily infected |
| **Needle tract seeding** | Similar to biopsy — tumour cells deposited along the needle path (risk ~1–2%) |
| **Post-ablation syndrome** | Low-grade fever, malaise, local pain lasting days — due to inflammatory response to tumour necrosis (self-limiting) |

#### 3.4 Post-TACE Complications [2]

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| ***Post-embolisation syndrome*** [2] | ***Liver injury due to tumour lysis or ischaemic damage to normal liver tissue; S/S: fever, RUQ pain, anorexia; resolves spontaneously after ~1 week*** | Occurs within 14 days. The most common complication. Supportive treatment only (analgesia, antiemetics, hydration). |
| ***Liver failure*** [2] | ***Infarction of normal liver tissues*** — if embolisation is too aggressive or liver function is borderline | The reason TACE is contraindicated in Child-Pugh C |
| ***Bile duct injury*** [2] | Ischaemic damage to biliary epithelium (bile ducts depend exclusively on arterial supply) | Can cause biliary strictures, bilomas |
| ***GI bleeding*** [2] | ***Cytotoxic reflux into other arterial supply to stomach*** — if chemotherapy/lipiodol inadvertently refluxes into the left gastric artery or gastroduodenal artery during injection | Gastric/duodenal ulceration → UGIB |
| **Hepatic artery dissection/thrombosis** | Catheter-related vascular injury during the procedure | Can compromise future TACE sessions and hepatic arterial supply |

#### 3.5 Systemic Therapy Complications

| Agent | Key Side Effects | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Sorafenib** | ***Hand-foot syndrome (acral erythema/palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia)*** [2]; fatigue; diarrhoea; hypertension | Drug concentrates in palms/soles capillary beds → keratinocyte damage. VEGFR inhibition → ↑ SVR → hypertension |
| **Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab** | GI bleeding (especially variceal — bevacizumab is anti-VEGF, impairs mucosal healing); hypertension; proteinuria; immune-related adverse events (hepatitis, colitis, pneumonitis, thyroiditis) | Anti-PD-L1 unleashes T-cell activity → autoimmune-like tissue damage. Anti-VEGF → impaired angiogenesis in normal tissues. **Must screen for and treat varices before starting bevacizumab** — untreated varices are a contraindication. |
| **Nivolumab / Pembrolizumab** | Immune-related hepatitis (can be severe in a patient with already compromised liver); endocrinopathies (thyroid, adrenal, pituitary); pneumonitis; colitis | Checkpoint inhibition removes the "brakes" on T-cells → they can attack normal tissues. |
| **Lenvatinib** | Hypertension, diarrhoea, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia, hypothyroidism | Multi-kinase inhibition including thyroid peroxidase pathway → hypothyroidism |

### 4. ***Why the Prognosis is So Poor*** — ***The 4 Reasons*** [1]

This is a favourite exam question. The senior notes explicitly outline ***4 reasons for poor prognosis*** [1]:

1. ***Present in the late stage*** [1]
   - ***Asymptomatic when the tumour is < 8 cm*** — ***no nerve fibres in the liver*** parenchyma itself; pain only occurs when Glisson's capsule is stretched, which requires a sizeable tumour
   - By the time symptoms develop, the tumour is usually too advanced for curative treatment

2. ***Presence of underlying liver diseases*** [1]
   - ***80–100% of patients with HCC have underlying cirrhosis*** (80% HBV, 100% HCV/alcohol)
   - This ***limits the scope for resection*** — you can't remove half a cirrhotic liver
   - ***Predisposes patients to post-treatment liver failure*** [1]

3. ***Early venous permeation*** [1]
   - ***High recurrence rate due to circulating tumour cells***
   - HCC's propensity for portal and hepatic vein invasion means microscopic vascular invasion is often already present at the time of "curative" resection

4. ***Field cancerisation effect*** [1]
   - ***Whole liver is exposed to oncogenic influence of HBV/HCV or cirrhosis***
   - ***Presence of multiple small tumours in sites that are not identified*** on preoperative imaging
   - Even after complete resection, a ***second primary HCC*** can develop from the remaining at-risk liver parenchyma
   - This explains the ***5-year recurrence rate of ~50%*** after hepatectomy [1][4]

<Callout title="Recurrence Timeline — Two Populations" type="idea">
Post-resection recurrence can be classified into two types [2]:
- **Early recurrence (< 2 years)**: predominantly **intrahepatic metastasis** — tumour cells that had already invaded portal vein branches before surgery but were undetectable on imaging
- **Late recurrence (> 2 years)**: predominantly **de novo HCC** — a new primary cancer arising from the field cancerisation effect in the remaining cirrhotic liver

This distinction matters because early recurrence reflects aggressive tumour biology (poor prognostic sign), while late recurrence reflects the ongoing oncogenic environment (supports the case for liver transplantation over resection in selected patients, as transplant removes the entire at-risk field).

### 5. Summary Table — Complications of HCC

| Category | Complications |
|---|---|
| **Tumour-related** | Ruptured HCC; PVTT and consequences; hepatic vein/IVC invasion; metastasis (intrahepatic, lung, bone, LN, peritoneum, adrenals); biliary invasion/haemobilia; paraneoplastic syndromes |
| **Cirrhosis-related** | Portal hypertension (ascites, variceal bleeding, splenomegaly); hepatic encephalopathy; coagulopathy; hepatorenal syndrome; SBP |
| **Post-hepatectomy** | Liver failure (50-50 rule); bile leakage; ischaemic damage; vascular thrombosis; pleural effusion; abscess |
| **Post-transplant** | Graft failure; rejection; vascular thrombosis; immunosuppression effects; recurrence |
| **Post-ablation** | Bile duct injury; thermal injury; abscess; needle tract seeding; post-ablation syndrome |
| **Post-TACE** | Post-embolisation syndrome; liver failure; bile duct injury; GI bleeding; arterial injury |
| **Systemic therapy** | Hand-foot syndrome; GI bleeding (bevacizumab); immune-related adverse events; hypertension |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Ruptured HCC**: Occurs in 5–10%, mortality 25–100%. Caused by large peripheral tumours with friable neovasculature. Presents with acute abdomen + shock. First-line = TAE; laparotomy if bleeding uncontrolled. Increases peritoneal seeding risk.

**Portal vein tumour thrombus**: Present in 30–60% of HCC. Worsens portal hypertension, causes variceal bleeding, accelerates liver failure, and contraindicates TACE. Indicates early IV spread with circulating tumour cells.

**Metastasis**: Intrahepatic (portal vein, most common) > Lung (hepatic vein → IVC) > Bone > LN > Peritoneum > Adrenals. Death usually precedes extensive metastasis due to liver failure.

**Post-hepatectomy liver failure**: Defined by Day 5 bilirubin > 50 + INR > 1.7 (50-50 rule). 2× higher risk in cirrhotics. Prevented by ensuring adequate FLR.

**4 Reasons for Poor Prognosis**: (1) Late presentation (asymptomatic until > 8 cm); (2) Underlying cirrhosis limits treatment and predisposes to liver failure; (3) Early venous permeation; (4) Field cancerisation (entire liver is at risk → 50% recurrence at 5 years).

**Recurrence after resection**: Early (< 2 years) = intrahepatic metastasis; Late (> 2 years) = de novo HCC from field change.
