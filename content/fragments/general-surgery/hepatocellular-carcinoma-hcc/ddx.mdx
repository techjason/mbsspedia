## Differential Diagnosis of a Liver Mass / Suspected HCC

When you encounter a patient with a liver mass — whether detected incidentally on imaging, found during screening of a chronic HBV carrier, or presenting with RUQ pain and hepatomegaly — you need a systematic framework to work through the differential diagnosis. The critical first question is always: **Is this mass malignant or benign? If malignant, is it primary or secondary (metastatic)?**

Let's build this framework from first principles, then work through each entity, explaining **why** it can mimic HCC and **how** to distinguish it.

---

### Overarching Framework

***The lecture slide from Prof Poon provides a clean framework for the differential diagnosis of hepatomegaly*** [4]:

**Malignancy:**
- ***Primary liver malignancies***
- ***Metastasis***
- ***Haematological malignancies (lymphoma, leukaemia, myeloproliferative disease)***

**Benign disease:**
- ***Benign neoplasms (haemangioma, adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia)***
- ***Cyst (simple cyst, polycystic disease)***
- ***Alcoholic cirrhosis***
- ***Others (e.g. liver abscess)***

The senior notes [1] present a slightly more granular version:

**Benign primary liver tumours:**
- Hepatic haemangioma
- Hepatic adenoma
- Focal nodular hyperplasia

**Malignant primary liver tumours:**
- Hepatocellular carcinoma
- Cholangiocarcinoma
- Fibrolamellar carcinoma
- Haemangioendothelioma

**Metastatic or disseminated tumours:**
- Leukaemia
- Lymphoma
- Myeloma
- Metastatic solid tumour

Let me now walk through each of these in clinical detail, explaining what they are, why they enter the differential, and the key distinguishing features from HCC.

### 1. Benign Primary Liver Tumours

#### 1.1 Hepatic Haemangioma

- **What it is**: A congenital vascular malformation composed of dilated blood-filled vascular spaces lined by endothelium. It is the ***most common benign liver tumour*** [2][6].
- **Why it enters the differential**: Both haemangioma and HCC are hypervascular on imaging. Both can present as incidental liver masses. A large haemangioma can cause RUQ pain and hepatomegaly.
- **Key distinguishing features**:

| Feature | Haemangioma | HCC |
|---|---|---|
| Demographics | Female predominance; any age | Male predominance; > 50 years; HBV/cirrhosis |
| AFP | **Normal** | Raised in ~70% |
| ***Triphasic CT*** | ***Peripheral nodular enhancement in arterial phase with progressive centripetal "fill-in" in portal/delayed phases*** — contrast "pools" in the vascular spaces and slowly fills inward (like pouring honey into a bowl from the edges) | ***Arterial hyperenhancement with portal venous/delayed washout*** — contrast washes OUT |
| MRI T2 | **Very bright** ("light bulb" sign) — because blood in dilated spaces has long T2 | Moderately bright |
| Biopsy | **Contraindicated** — risk of catastrophic haemorrhage (it's literally a bag of blood) | Only if diagnosis uncertain and unresectable |

<Callout title="Exam Pearl">
The **hallmark** of haemangioma on triphasic CT is **centripetal fill-in** (from periphery to centre) in the delayed phase. This is the exact **opposite** of HCC, which shows **centrifugal washout** (contrast leaves the tumour). If the CT shows delayed phase enhancement → think haemangioma, not HCC.
</Callout>

#### 1.2 Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH)

- **What it is**: A hyperplastic regenerative nodule that forms in response to a pre-existing arterial malformation (an aberrant "feeding" artery). It is **not a true neoplasm** — it's a hyperplastic response to abnormal blood flow [6].
- **Why it enters the differential**: Arterially enhancing liver mass in a young/middle-aged patient. Can be mistaken for HCC especially if a background liver disease is present.
- **Key distinguishing features**:

| Feature | FNH | HCC |
|---|---|---|
| Demographics | Female; 20–50 years; OCP use (but NOT caused by OCP) | Male; > 50 years; HBV/cirrhosis |
| AFP | Normal | Raised in ~70% |
| **Characteristic imaging** | ***Central stellate scar*** (a fibrous scar containing the anomalous artery, bile ductules, and Kupffer cells); arterial enhancement but **NO washout** (or very mild). The scar enhances on **delayed phase**. | Arterial enhancement WITH washout |
| Kupffer cells | **Present** (this is key — FNH contains functioning Kupffer cells) → takes up hepatospecific contrast (Primovist/gadoxetate) on MRI and technetium-99m sulphur colloid on scintigraphy | **Absent or dysfunctional** Kupffer cells → does NOT take up hepatospecific contrast |
| ***Size*** | ***Usually solitary and < 5 cm*** [6] | Variable, often > 5 cm at diagnosis |
| Malignant potential | **None** — no risk of malignant transformation | N/A (already malignant) |
| Management | **Observation** (no treatment needed unless symptomatic) | Surgical/locoregional treatment |

#### 1.3 Hepatic Adenoma

- **What it is**: A **benign proliferation of hepatocytes** (a true neoplasm, unlike FNH). The name "hepat-oma" literally means liver tumour — confusingly, some older texts use "hepatoma" for HCC, but strictly it should refer to this benign lesion [6].
- **Why it enters the differential**: Arterially enhancing solid liver mass, can be large, and importantly **can rupture** (like HCC) causing haemoperitoneum. Also has **malignant potential** → can transform into HCC.
- **Key distinguishing features**:

| Feature | Hepatic Adenoma | HCC |
|---|---|---|
| Demographics | ***Female, 25–50 years, OCP use*** (oestrogen-driven) [6] | Male; > 50 years; HBV/cirrhosis |
| AFP | Normal | Raised in ~70% |
| Background liver | **Normal** (no cirrhosis) | Usually cirrhotic |
| Risk of rupture | ***Yes — rupture → haemoperitoneum*** [6] | Yes |
| Malignant transformation | **Yes** (especially β-catenin-activating subtype) — reason for recommending resection | N/A |
| Imaging | Arterial enhancement, may have internal haemorrhage/fat; **NO central scar** (unlike FNH); variable washout | Classic arterial enhancement + washout |
| Management | **Stop OCP** + consider resection (especially if > 5 cm or β-catenin subtype) | Treat as HCC |

<Callout title="Adenoma vs FNH — The Management Crux" type="idea">
FNH = observe (no malignant potential, no rupture risk). Adenoma = stop OCP and consider resection (risk of rupture AND malignant transformation). Don't mix these up — the management is completely different despite both being "benign liver lesions in young women."
</Callout>

### 2. Malignant Primary Liver Tumours

#### 2.1 ***Cholangiocarcinoma (CC)*** [4][7][8]

- **What it is**: ***Adenocarcinoma of the bile duct epithelium*** (cholangio- = bile duct, carcinoma = malignant epithelial tumour). > 90% are adenocarcinoma [7][8].
- ***Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) accounts for 5–20% of primary liver malignancy*** [7] and is the **second most common primary liver cancer after HCC** [2].
- **Why it enters the differential**: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma presents as a liver mass, often in a patient with chronic liver disease (HCV, PSC), and can be difficult to distinguish from HCC on imaging.

| Feature | Cholangiocarcinoma | HCC |
|---|---|---|
| Cell of origin | Cholangiocyte (bile duct epithelium) | Hepatocyte |
| ***Association*** | ***Ulcerative colitis/PSC (Western), recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (Oriental)*** [7] | HBV, HCV, cirrhosis |
| AFP | **Normal** (bile duct cells don't make AFP) | Raised in ~70% |
| ***Tumour markers*** | ***CEA, CA 19-9 (may or may not be elevated, nonspecific)*** [7] | AFP |
| Triphasic CT | **Peripheral rim enhancement** in arterial phase, progressive **centripetal enhancement** in delayed phase (because of the dense desmoplastic stroma that slowly takes up contrast) — the opposite of HCC washout | Arterial hyperenhancement + washout |
| Histology (IHC) | **CK7+, CK19+** (biliary markers); **HepPar-1 negative** | **HepPar-1+, Glypican-3+**; CK7 variable |
| Bile production (gross) | No green discolouration (cholangiocytes don't make bile pigment; they secrete mucin) | ***Green discolouration (bile production)*** |
| ***Clinical*** | ***RUQ pain, hepatomegaly, jaundice (extrahepatic obstruction)*** [7] | RUQ pain, hepatomegaly, jaundice less common |
| Mucin | **Mucin-producing** (desmoplastic, scirrhous tumour) | No mucin |

<Callout title="AFP as the Key Discriminator" type="error">
If AFP is significantly elevated ( > 400 ng/mL), the mass is almost certainly HCC, not cholangiocarcinoma. Conversely, if AFP is normal and CA 19-9 is elevated, think cholangiocarcinoma. However, there exists a rare **combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma** that may have elevated AFP [8].
</Callout>

#### 2.2 ***Fibrolamellar Carcinoma (FLC)***

- Already discussed in the pathology section but worth reiterating as a differential:
- ***Histologic variant of HCC; most common in younger women, good prognosis*** [4]
- ***Not associated with HBV or cirrhosis*** [2]
- AFP is typically **normal** (because the well-differentiated tumour cells don't secrete AFP efficiently)
- Imaging: large mass with **central calcified scar** (unlike FNH, the scar does NOT enhance on delayed phase)
- If you see a large liver mass in a young patient without cirrhosis and normal AFP → think fibrolamellar HCC

#### 2.3 Haemangioendothelioma

- **Epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (EHE)**: a rare low-to-intermediate grade vascular malignancy
- Presents as **multiple liver lesions**, often at the periphery with capsular retraction (a fairly characteristic finding)
- Can mimic metastatic disease on imaging
- Distinguished from HCC by: no association with HBV/cirrhosis, normal AFP, IHC positive for vascular markers (CD31, CD34, Factor VIII)
- In children, **infantile haemangioendothelioma** is a distinct entity (benign vascular tumour of infancy)

#### 2.4 Hepatic Angiosarcoma

- Extremely rare, highly aggressive malignant vascular tumour
- Associated with **Thorotrast** (thorium dioxide — an old radiological contrast agent), vinyl chloride, arsenic, and anabolic steroids
- Presents with rapidly enlarging liver mass, haemoperitoneum (rupture), consumptive coagulopathy
- Prognosis is dismal

#### 2.5 Primary Hepatic Lymphoma

- Rare; liver is more commonly involved secondarily in systemic lymphoma
- Can present as a solitary mass or diffuse infiltration
- Distinguished from HCC by: LDH elevation, normal AFP, imaging may show a "low density" mass, and diagnosis requires biopsy with IHC (CD20+ for B-cell lymphoma)

### 3. ***Metastatic / Secondary Liver Tumours*** [4][9]

***Metastatic carcinoma to the liver is commoner than primary liver cancer*** [9]. In fact, liver metastases are ***20× more common than primary liver tumours*** [2].

Why? Because the liver receives the **entire portal venous drainage from the GI tract** — any cancer shedding cells into the portal circulation has direct access to the liver sinusoids. The liver also has a dual blood supply and a rich sinusoidal network that acts as a "filter" trapping circulating tumour cells.

#### Common Primary Sources [2][9]

The mnemonic from the senior notes is helpful: ***"Some GU Cancers Produce Bumpy Lumps"*** [2]:
- **S**tomach
- **GU**: kidney, ovary, uterus
- **C**olon (***most common*** — accounts for ~1/3 of liver metastases) [2]
- **P**ancreas
- **B**reast
- **L**ung

***Commonest site is from GI tract (portal venous circulation): colorectal, stomach, pancreas*** [9].

#### Key Distinguishing Features from HCC

| Feature | Liver Metastasis | HCC |
|---|---|---|
| History | Known primary cancer elsewhere; change of bowel habit (CRC); breast lump | HBV carrier, cirrhosis |
| Number | Usually **multiple** (bilateral involvement) | Often solitary or oligonodular (though multifocal possible) |
| Liver parenchyma | **Normal** (no cirrhosis) | Usually **cirrhotic** |
| AFP | **Normal** (unless primary is germ cell tumour or gastric) | Raised in ~70% |
| ***Tumour markers*** | ***CEA (CRC, gastric), CA 19-9 (pancreatic, biliary), CA 125 (ovarian), chromogranin A (neuroendocrine)*** [2][9] | AFP |
| ***Triphasic CT*** | ***Hypodense on ALL phases*** [2] (most metastases are **hypovascular** — in contrast to HCC which is hypervascular) | Arterial hyperenhancement + washout |
| Exception | **Hypervascular metastases** (RCC, neuroendocrine tumours, melanoma, thyroid, breast) may show arterial enhancement — can mimic HCC | — |
| Clinical | ***Hard nodular hepatomegaly, RUQ tenderness, obstructive jaundice (if metastasis to porta hepatis LN)*** [2] | Variable |

<Callout title="The Triphasic CT 'Cheat Sheet'">

| Lesion | Arterial Phase | Portovenous Phase | Delayed Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HCC** | ***Hyperdense*** | ***Washout (hypodense)*** | ***Hypodense*** |
| **Haemangioma** | Peripheral nodular enhancement | Progressive centripetal fill-in | **Isodense or hyperdense (fill-in complete)** |
| **Liver metastasis** | ***Hypodense*** | ***Hypodense*** | ***Hypodense*** |
| **Cholangiocarcinoma** | Peripheral rim enhancement | Progressive delayed enhancement | Hyperdense (desmoplastic stroma) |
| **FNH** | Hyperdense (except scar) | Iso/slightly hyperdense | Scar enhances late |

This table alone will answer a huge number of exam questions. Memorise it.
</Callout>

### 4. ***Cystic Lesions*** [4]

***Cysts (simple cyst, polycystic disease)*** [4] should be mentioned:

| Entity | Features | Why in DDx |
|---|---|---|
| **Simple hepatic cyst** | Thin-walled, anechoic on USG, no internal septations or solid components | Common incidental finding; easy to distinguish from HCC on USG |
| **Polycystic liver disease** | Multiple cysts, often associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) | Can cause massive hepatomegaly; distinguished by cystic nature |
| **Hydatid cyst** (Echinococcus) | Thick-walled, may have "daughter cysts," calcification, "water lily" sign | Endemic in sheep-farming areas; eosinophilia, positive serology |
| **Biliary cystadenoma / cystadenocarcinoma** | Multiloculated cystic mass with mural nodules, thick septae | Rare; malignant potential; middle-aged women |
| ***Liver abscess*** [4] | Pyogenic (polymicrobial, often post-biliary surgery) or amoebic (Entamoeba histolytica); fever, RUQ pain, leucocytosis | Can mimic necrotic HCC on imaging; distinguished by clinical context (fever, leucocytosis), aspiration (pus) |

---

### 5. Other Non-Neoplastic Causes of Hepatomegaly [4]

While not true "liver masses," these conditions cause hepatomegaly and may enter the differential on physical examination:

- ***Alcoholic cirrhosis*** [4] — early cirrhosis can cause hepatomegaly (fatty, enlarged liver); later it becomes shrunken
- **Congestive hepatopathy** (right heart failure) — smooth, tender hepatomegaly; pulsatile if tricuspid regurgitation
- **Budd-Chiari syndrome** — hepatic vein thrombosis → congestive hepatomegaly, ascites, abdominal pain
- **Amyloidosis** — diffuse infiltration → massive firm hepatomegaly
- **Glycogen storage diseases** — paediatric; massive hepatomegaly

---

### 6. ***Clinical Approach to Hepatomegaly*** [4]

The lecture slides give a structured approach that you should follow on the wards:

**History** [4]:
- ***Pain, change of bowel habit, other GI symptoms, tea-colour urine***
- ***Systemic symptoms of malignancy (anorexia, nausea, weight loss), fever***
- ***Systemic review of other systems***
- ***Past history of chronic liver disease***
- ***Social history: alcohol***
- ***Family history: any malignancy***

**Physical Examination** [4]:
- ***General examination: cachexia, pallor, jaundice, lymphadenopathy, chronic stigmata of liver disease***
- ***Abdominal examination: hepatomegaly — size, tenderness, consistency, surface, edge, bruit***
- ***Other organomegaly (spleen), mass, ascites***
- ***PR examination***

**Investigations** [4]:
- ***Blood tests: complete blood count, liver function test, coagulation, hepatitis serology (B and C), tumour markers (AFP, CEA, CA 19.9)***
- ***Imaging: chest X-ray, ultrasound, CT scan, MRI***
- ***Endoscopy (for suspected GI primary): upper endoscopy, colonoscopy***
- ***Biopsy: fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), Trucut biopsy***

<Callout title="The Systematic Approach to a Liver Mass — Summary">

1. **History**: HBV status, alcohol, chronic liver disease, known cancer, constitutional symptoms
2. **Examination**: Characterise the hepatomegaly (size, consistency, surface, tenderness, bruit); look for stigmata of CLD; check for splenomegaly and ascites
3. **Bloods**: AFP, CEA, CA 19-9, LFT, hepatitis serology, coagulation
4. **Imaging**: USG first → Triphasic CT (gold standard) → MRI if needed
5. **Biopsy**: ONLY if diagnosis remains uncertain AND the lesion is unresectable (risk of bleeding and needle tract seeding)

### Summary Table — Differential Diagnosis of a Liver Mass

| Diagnosis | Age/Sex | Background | AFP | Key Imaging Feature | Other Markers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **HCC** | M > 50 | HBV, cirrhosis | **↑↑** | Arterial enhancement + washout | HBV serology |
| **Haemangioma** | F, any age | None | Normal | Peripheral fill-in on delayed | None |
| **FNH** | F, 20–50 | None | Normal | Central scar, no washout | None |
| **Hepatic adenoma** | F, 25–50, OCP | None | Normal | Arterial enhancement, heterogeneous | None |
| **Cholangiocarcinoma** | > 50 | PSC, RPC | Normal | Delayed enhancement (desmoplasia) | CA 19-9, CEA |
| **Fibrolamellar HCC** | Young | **No** cirrhosis | Normal | Central calcified scar | None |
| **Liver metastasis** | Any | Known primary | Normal | Hypodense all phases (most) | CEA, CA 19-9 |
| **Liver abscess** | Any | Biliary disease, travel | Normal | Rim-enhancing collection, air | Leucocytosis, CRP |
| **Haemangioendothelioma** | Any | Thorotrast | Normal | Peripheral capsular retraction | CD31, CD34 |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Framework**: Liver mass DDx = Benign primary (haemangioma, FNH, adenoma) vs Malignant primary (HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, fibrolamellar, haemangioendothelioma) vs Metastatic (most common: CRC, stomach, pancreas, breast, lung) vs Cystic (simple cyst, abscess, hydatid) vs Non-neoplastic (cirrhosis, congestion).

**Key discriminators**:
- **AFP > 400** → virtually diagnostic of HCC
- **Triphasic CT** is the gold standard: HCC = arterial enhancement + washout; haemangioma = peripheral fill-in; metastasis = hypodense all phases; cholangiocarcinoma = delayed enhancement
- **Background liver**: HCC almost always has cirrhosis/HBV; metastases and benign tumours have normal liver
- **Liver metastases are 20× more common than primary liver tumours** — always consider a secondary cause
- **Biopsy only if diagnosis uncertain AND lesion unresectable** — risk of bleeding and tumour seeding

**Clinical approach to hepatomegaly** (Prof Poon): History (CLD, alcohol, malignancy) → Examination (characterise liver, stigmata of CLD, spleen, ascites) → Bloods (AFP, CEA, CA19-9, LFT, Hep serology) → Imaging (USG → CT → MRI) → Endoscopy if GI primary suspected → Biopsy only if indicated.
