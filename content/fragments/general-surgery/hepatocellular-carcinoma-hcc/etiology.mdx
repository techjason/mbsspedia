## 1. Definition

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a **primary malignant neoplasm arising from hepatocytes** — the principal parenchymal cells of the liver. Let's break the name down:

- **Hepato-** (Greek *hēpar*) = liver
- **-cellular** = of cells
- **Carcinoma** (Greek *karkinos* = crab + *-oma* = tumour) = malignant epithelial neoplasm

So the name literally tells you: **a malignant tumour of liver cells**.

It is the **most common primary liver cancer (~80%)**, with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) accounting for ~15% and other rare subtypes making up the remainder [1][2][3].

HCC characteristically develops in a background of **chronic liver disease and cirrhosis**, making it almost unique among solid malignancies — the organ harbouring the cancer is itself already diseased and dysfunctional. This dual pathology (cancer + liver failure) is what makes HCC so challenging to manage and so lethal.

<Callout title="Key Concept">
HCC is one of the few cancers where the patient may die from the **underlying organ failure** (cirrhosis) rather than from the cancer itself. Treatment must always account for **both** the tumour burden AND the liver function reserve.
</Callout>

## 2. Epidemiology

### 2.1 Global Epidemiology

- HCC is the **6th most common cancer worldwide** and the **3rd leading cause of cancer-related death globally** (after lung and colorectal cancer) [1][2].
- Globally ~900,000 new cases/year and ~830,000 deaths/year (2020 GLOBOCAN data), reflecting the very high case-fatality ratio.
- There is a striking **geographic variation** linked to the prevalence of underlying aetiologies:

| Region | Incidence | Dominant Aetiology |
|---|---|---|
| ***East Asia (China, HK), Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa*** | **High** | **HBV** |
| Japan, Southern Europe, Egypt | Intermediate–High | HCV |
| ***UK, North America, Australia*** | **Low (but rising)** | HCV, NAFLD/NASH, Alcohol |

- The rising incidence in Western countries is driven by the **NAFLD/NASH epidemic** (obesity, metabolic syndrome) and ageing HCV cohorts [2].

### 2.2 Hong Kong Epidemiology

This is **extremely high-yield** for HKUMed exams.

- ***HCC is exceedingly common in Hong Kong*** [1][4].
- ***Second commonest cancer death in Hong Kong*** [4] (some older data cites 3rd — the ranking fluctuates between 2nd and 3rd with lung and colorectal cancer; as of recent data, it is the **3rd most common cause of cancer death** in HK, but lecture slides from Prof Poon state **second** [4]).
- ***5th most common cancer in HK*** overall by incidence [2].
- ***HCC is 6× more common than cholangiocarcinoma*** (HCC:CC = 6:1) [1].
- HCC constitutes **78.7%** of primary malignant liver tumours in HK, CC = 9.7% [1].
- ***M:F = 4:1*** [4] (some older data quotes 6:1 — the key point is a **strong male predominance**, partly explained by higher HBV carrier rates in males, androgen-related pathways, and higher rates of alcohol use).
- ***Most patients age > 50 years, but can occur in young patients*** [4].
- **Peak age of mortality = 45–55 years** in HK [1].
- ***80% of HCC in Hong Kong are HBsAg-positive*** — i.e. **Hepatitis B is the overwhelmingly dominant aetiology in HK** [3][4].
- ***Frequent association with cirrhosis (80% in Hong Kong)*** [4].

<Callout title="High Yield — Hong Kong Focus">
In HK, think **HBV → Cirrhosis → HCC**. About **80% of HCC patients are HBsAg+**, and **80% have underlying cirrhosis**. This is the bread-and-butter clinical scenario you will see on the wards at Queen Mary Hospital.
</Callout>

### 2.3 Survival

- ***Insidious onset with rapidly progressing course which is fatal*** [1].
- **Median survival of untreated HCC = 2–4 months** (for symptomatic, advanced disease) [1].
- **5-year survival** varies dramatically by stage:
  - Early stage (BCLC 0/A) with curative treatment: **50–70%**
  - Intermediate stage (BCLC B): **~20%**
  - Advanced/Terminal stage: **< 5%**

---

## 3. Anatomy and Function — Relevant Hepatic Anatomy

Understanding liver anatomy is **critical** for HCC because it determines resectability, blood supply for locoregional therapy, and patterns of spread.

### 3.1 Liver Segments (Couinaud Classification)

The liver is divided into **8 functionally independent segments** (I–VIII), each with its own:
- Portal pedicle (portal vein branch, hepatic artery branch, bile duct)
- Hepatic venous drainage

This segmental anatomy is the basis for **anatomical hepatic resection** — you can remove segments independently because each is a self-contained unit.

| Division | Segments | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Right lobe** | V, VI, VII, VIII | Separated from left by the **middle hepatic vein** (Cantlie's line) |
| **Left lobe** | II, III, IV | Segment IV is the **quadrate lobe** |
| **Caudate lobe** | I | Unique: drains directly into IVC via short hepatic veins; has dual portal blood supply from both right and left portal branches |

### 3.2 Dual Blood Supply

The liver has a **unique dual blood supply**, which is essential for understanding HCC biology and treatment:

1. **Portal vein** (~75% of hepatic blood flow): carries nutrient-rich, relatively deoxygenated blood from the GI tract
2. **Hepatic artery** (~25% of hepatic blood flow): carries oxygenated blood from the coeliac trunk

**Why does this matter for HCC?**

- **Normal hepatocytes** derive most of their blood supply from the **portal vein**.
- **HCC tumour nodules** derive **>90% of their blood supply from the hepatic artery** (neoangiogenesis is predominantly arterial).
- This differential supply is the basis for:
  - ***Arterial enhancement on CT/MRI*** (tumour "lights up" in arterial phase → washes out in portal venous/delayed phase — the **hallmark imaging feature** of HCC)
  - ***Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE)*** — you deliver chemotherapy and embolic material via the hepatic artery, selectively starving the tumour while relatively sparing normal liver parenchyma

### 3.3 Hepatic Venous Drainage

Three major hepatic veins (right, middle, left) drain into the **inferior vena cava (IVC)**. This is relevant because:

- HCC has a ***high propensity for venous invasion (portal and hepatic veins)*** [4]
- ***Spread through portal vein branches*** → **intrahepatic metastasis** (the most common route of intrahepatic spread)
- ***Spread through hepatic vein branches*** → IVC → **right heart → lungs** [1]
- **Portal vein tumour thrombus (PVTT)** is one of the most significant adverse prognostic features

### 3.4 Glisson's Capsule

The liver is enveloped by **Glisson's capsule** (a thin layer of connective tissue derived from the peritoneum). The **liver parenchyma itself has no pain fibres** — pain only occurs when Glisson's capsule is **stretched or invaded** by tumour. This explains why:

- Small HCCs are **painless** (they don't stretch the capsule)
- Large HCCs cause **RUQ pain ± referred right shoulder pain** (diaphragmatic irritation via phrenic nerve, C3-C5) [2]
- **Ruptured HCC** causes sudden severe abdominal pain and peritonism

### 3.5 Relationship to Other Structures

- **Hilum (porta hepatis)**: where the portal vein, hepatic artery, and common hepatic duct enter/exit. HCC spread to hilar lymph nodes occurs here [1].
- **Diaphragm**: the liver dome is in close proximity; large HCCs can invade or irritate the diaphragm.

## 4. Etiology (Focus on Hong Kong)

<Callout title="Framework for HCC Aetiology" type="idea">
Think of it as: **Anything that causes chronic liver injury → inflammation → fibrosis → cirrhosis → HCC**. The carcinogenic "highway" is: **Chronic injury → Regeneration → Mutation accumulation → Dysplasia → HCC**. However, HBV is unique because it can cause HCC even WITHOUT cirrhosis (via direct DNA integration).
</Callout>

### 4.1 Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) — ***The Dominant Cause in HK (80%)*** [3][4]

***Hepatitis B virus is responsible for ~80% of HCC cases in Hong Kong*** [3][4].

**Why does HBV cause HCC? Two mechanisms:**

1. **Indirect (via cirrhosis):** Chronic HBV infection → chronic hepatic inflammation → hepatocyte necrosis and regeneration → progressive fibrosis → **cirrhosis** → HCC
   - ***Risk of cirrhosis = 20–30% of chronically infected adults will develop cirrhosis over 10–15 years*** [1]

2. **Direct oncogenic effect (unique to HBV, not HCV):**
   - ***HBV DNA integrates into the host hepatocyte genome*** — this can activate proto-oncogenes or disrupt tumour suppressor genes [5]
   - ***HBV-encoded X antigen (HBxAg), Pre-S1, Pre-S2 proteins are responsible for carcinogenesis*** [1]:
     - **HBx protein** → transactivates cellular oncogenes, inhibits p53 tumour suppressor function, promotes cell proliferation, inhibits DNA repair, activates NF-κB and MAPK pathways
     - **Pre-S mutants** → cause ER stress, oxidative DNA damage, and genomic instability
   - Because of this direct oncogenic effect, ***HCC complicating HBV can present on a non-cirrhotic liver (20% of cases)*** [1]

<Callout title="HBV vs HCV in HCC" type="error">
A common exam mistake: students assume all HCC arises in cirrhotic livers. **This is true for HCV (100% cirrhotic) but NOT for HBV (80% cirrhotic, 20% non-cirrhotic)**. HBV has a **direct oncogenic effect** through DNA integration — it doesn't need cirrhosis as an intermediate step. This is a favourite exam question.
</Callout>

**Risk factors for HCC in HBV carriers:**
- Male sex
- Older age (> 40 years)
- Family history of HCC
- High HBV DNA viral load (> 2000 IU/mL)
- HBeAg positivity
- Genotype C (common in HK)
- Co-infection with HCV, HDV, or HIV
- Active inflammation (elevated ALT)
- Presence of cirrhosis
- Aflatoxin exposure (synergistic with HBV)

### 4.2 Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)

- ***Common in Japan and Western countries*** [4] but accounts for only ~4% of HCC in HK [1].
- ***HCC complicating HCV ALWAYS presents on a cirrhotic liver (100%)*** [1] — HCV is an RNA virus that does **not** integrate into host DNA (unlike HBV). Therefore HCV causes HCC purely through the **indirect pathway**: chronic inflammation → cirrhosis → HCC.
- HCV causes HCC at a rate of ~1–4% per year in cirrhotic patients.
- With the advent of **direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)**, HCV can now be cured in > 95% of cases, but the risk of HCC persists even after viral eradication (especially if cirrhosis is already established).

### 4.3 ***Cirrhosis (Any Cause)*** [3][4]

- ***Cirrhosis is present in 70–90% of HCC cases overall; 80% in HK*** [1][4].
- **Any cause of cirrhosis** can lead to HCC, because the final common pathway is: **chronic hepatocyte injury → regenerative hyperplasia → dysplastic nodules → HCC**.
- The annual risk of HCC development in a cirrhotic liver is **1–6%/year** depending on the aetiology.

### 4.4 ***Alcoholic Liver Disease*** [3][4]

- Accounts for ~4% of HCC cases in HK [1] but is a major cause in Western countries.
- ***HCC develops on top of alcoholic cirrhosis (100%)*** — alcohol does not have a direct oncogenic effect comparable to HBV [1].
- Mechanism: Chronic alcohol → acetaldehyde (toxic metabolite) → oxidative stress + lipid peroxidation → hepatocyte injury → inflammation → fibrosis → cirrhosis → HCC.
- ***High but NOT moderate level of alcohol consumption*** is the risk factor [1].
- Alcohol can also act synergistically with HBV or HCV to accelerate cirrhosis and HCC development.

### 4.5 Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) / Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)

- Now renamed **MASLD** (2023 nomenclature), encompassing:
  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) / metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver (MASL)
  - Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) / metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)
- The **fastest-growing cause of HCC worldwide**, driven by the global obesity/metabolic syndrome epidemic.
- NASH-related HCC can occur **without cirrhosis** in up to 20–30% of cases — similar to HBV. This is thought to be due to the pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidative environment of steatohepatitis driving direct DNA damage.
- Key metabolic risk factors: **obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome** [1][2].

### 4.6 ***Aflatoxin*** [3][4]

- ***Mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus flavus*** which contaminates corn, soybeans, and peanuts [1].
- ***Leads to mutation of the p53 tumour suppressor gene*** (specifically the **R249S hotspot mutation** — an arginine-to-serine substitution at codon 249) [1].
- ***Risk factor in Africa and rural areas of China but NOT Hong Kong*** [1][4].
- Aflatoxin has a **synergistic** effect with HBV: the combination of HBV + aflatoxin exposure increases HCC risk **multiplicatively** (up to 60× compared to neither alone).

### 4.7 Autoimmune Liver Diseases [1]

- **Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)**: chronic inflammation → cirrhosis → HCC
- **Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)**: progressive bile duct destruction → biliary cirrhosis → HCC
- **Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)**: biliary stricturing and inflammation → biliary cirrhosis → both cholangiocarcinoma (more common) and HCC

### 4.8 Genetic/Metabolic Diseases [1]

- **Hereditary haemochromatosis**: excess iron deposition → oxidative stress → hepatocyte injury → cirrhosis → HCC. Iron itself is also a direct mutagen via Fenton chemistry (Fe²⁺ + H₂O₂ → OH• free radicals).
- **Wilson's disease**: copper overload → oxidative liver damage → cirrhosis → HCC (though interestingly, the risk of HCC in Wilson's disease is **lower** than expected, possibly because excess copper has some anti-tumour properties).
- **α1-antitrypsin deficiency**: misfolded protein accumulates in hepatocyte ER → ER stress → chronic liver injury → cirrhosis → HCC.

### 4.9 Other Risk Factors

| Risk Factor | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Obesity*** [1] | Insulin resistance → hyperinsulinaemia → ↑IGF-1 → hepatocyte proliferation; also promotes NASH |
| ***Diabetes mellitus*** [1] | Hyperinsulinaemia → mitogenic effect; DM independently ↑ HCC risk 2–3× |
| ***Smoking*** [1] | Tobacco carcinogens (nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) → direct DNA damage in hepatocytes |
| Oral contraceptives / Androgens | Rare; associated with hepatic adenoma → malignant transformation |

<Callout title="Exam Summary — HCC Aetiology in HK">

**The "Big 3" in HK**: (1) HBV (80%), (2) HCV (4%), (3) Alcohol (4%). The remainder is NASH, cryptogenic, and rare causes. **Always ask about HBV status first** in any patient with a liver mass in HK.

</Callout>

## 5. Pathophysiology

### 5.1 The Multistep Carcinogenesis Pathway

***HCC develops through a well-characterised multistep process, beautifully illustrated on the lecture slide showing the progression from chronic liver disease to HCC*** [5]:

```
Chronic Liver Injury → Hepatocyte Proliferation → Fibrosis/Cirrhosis →
Hyperplastic Nodule → Dysplastic Nodule (Low → High Grade) →
Well-Differentiated HCC → Moderately Differentiated → Poorly Differentiated HCC
```

Let's walk through each step:

1. **Chronic liver injury** (HBV, HCV, alcohol, NASH, etc.) → ongoing hepatocyte death
2. **Stellate cell activation** → ***extensive scarring (collagen deposition)*** → fibrosis → cirrhosis [5]
3. **Hepatocyte regeneration** under proliferative pressure → ***telomere shortening*** with each cell division [5]
4. **Hyperplastic nodules** → still polyclonal, no dysplasia
5. ***Moderate genomic instability*** → **Dysplastic nodules** → monoclonal, contain cytological atypia [5]
6. ***Telomerase reactivation*** → cells escape senescence and gain replicative immortality [5]
7. ***Marked genomic instability*** → ***Loss of p53*** and other tumour suppressors → **HCC** [5]
8. Progressive dedifferentiation: well-differentiated → moderately differentiated → poorly differentiated

<Callout title="The Telomere Story" type="idea">
This is elegant: chronic liver injury forces hepatocytes to divide repeatedly. Each division shortens telomeres (the protective DNA caps). Eventually, critically short telomeres trigger **genomic instability** — chromosomes break and fuse abnormally. To escape this crisis, some cells **reactivate telomerase** (TERT promoter mutations are found in > 60% of HCC). These cells now have unlimited replication + genomic instability = cancer.
</Callout>

### 5.2 Key Molecular Alterations in HCC

| Pathway | Alteration | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **TERT promoter** | Activating mutation (most common, ~60%) | Telomerase reactivation → replicative immortality |
| **TP53** | ***Loss-of-function mutation*** [5] | Loss of cell cycle checkpoint → uncontrolled proliferation |
| **CTNNB1 (β-catenin)** | Activating mutation (~30%) | Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation → proliferation |
| **HBV DNA integration** | Insertional mutagenesis | Disrupts tumour suppressors or activates oncogenes |
| **VEGF / FGF** | Overexpression | Neoangiogenesis → hypervascular tumour |
| **RAS/MAPK** | Activation | Cell proliferation and survival |
| **PI3K/AKT/mTOR** | Activation | Growth signalling |

### 5.3 Vascular Biology of HCC

***HCC is a vascular tumour with a high propensity for venous invasion (portal and hepatic veins)*** [4].

- **Neoangiogenesis**: HCC secretes high levels of VEGF, creating a rich network of abnormal arterial vessels → this is why HCC is a **hypervascular** tumour
- **Arterial blood supply**: as hepatocytes become dysplastic and then malignant, they progressively lose their portal venous supply and become increasingly dependent on hepatic artery branches via **unpaired arteries** (arteries not accompanied by portal tracts). This arterialisation is a hallmark of HCC.
- **Sinusoidal capillarisation**: normal liver sinusoids are fenestrated (with gaps); in HCC, sinusoids become capillarised (endothelium becomes continuous) → contributes to the imaging characteristics.

### 5.4 Pathology

#### Gross (Macroscopic) Appearance [1][4]

***Three macroscopic types: massive, nodular, diffuse*** [4]:

| Type | Description | Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Massive** | Single large mass, often in right lobe | Most common type; may have satellite nodules |
| **Nodular** | Multiple discrete nodules scattered throughout liver | Often in cirrhotic livers; can be confused with regenerative/dysplastic nodules |
| **Diffuse** | Innumerable small nodules permeating entire liver | Worst prognosis; difficult to distinguish from cirrhotic nodules; essentially unresectable |

Other gross features [1]:
- ***Soft in texture***
- ***Light-brown or tan-coloured masses***
- ***Yellow patches of necrosis*** — because the tumour outgrows its blood supply (central necrosis is common in large tumours)
- ***Extensive haemorrhagic areas*** — because the ***tumour is highly vascular and derives blood supply from sinusoids and hepatic artery*** [1]
- ***Green discolouration of tumour*** — ***production of bile by tumour cells*** → this is a ***diagnostic feature of HCC*** (because only hepatocytes make bile; if you see a green liver tumour, it's HCC until proven otherwise) [1]
- ***Formation of clear cells*** → ***secretion of insulin-like peptide (ILP)*** → ***induces attacks of hypoglycaemia*** → ***excess glycogen in the tumour (clear cells)*** [1]

#### Histological Appearance [1]

- ***Trabecular pattern of hepatocytes (80%)*** — the most common pattern; tumour cells arranged in plates/cords resembling normal hepatic architecture, separated by sinusoidal vascular spaces [1]
- ***Pseudoglandular pattern*** — tumour cells form gland-like structures (acini) [1]
- ***Vascular sinusoids*** — lined by endothelium; prominent vascularity [1]
- **Compact/solid pattern** — sheets of tumour cells with minimal sinusoidal framework
- Tumour cells resemble hepatocytes to varying degrees (well → moderately → poorly differentiated)
- **Mallory-Denk bodies**, fat, glycogen, and bile may be seen within tumour cells

#### Histological Variant: ***Fibrolamellar HCC (FLC)*** [2][4]

- ***Most common in younger women (and young patients generally)*** [4]
- ***Good prognosis*** compared to conventional HCC [4]
- ***Not associated with HBV or cirrhosis*** [2]
- Characterised by **large eosinophilic tumour cells** with abundant mitochondria, separated by **dense lamellar fibrosis** (parallel bands of collagen) — hence "fibro-lamellar"
- Often has a **central scar** (can mimic focal nodular hyperplasia on imaging)
- Pathognomonic molecular feature: **DNAJB1-PRKACA** fusion gene

## 6. Classification and Staging

### 6.1 TNM Staging (AJCC/UICC 8th Edition, 2017) [1]

| Stage | T | N | M | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **IA** | T1a | N0 | M0 | Solitary ≤ 2 cm, ± vascular invasion |
| **IB** | T1b | N0 | M0 | Solitary > 2 cm, without vascular invasion |
| **II** | T2 | N0 | M0 | Solitary with vascular invasion > 2 cm, OR multiple ≤ 5 cm |
| **IIIA** | T3 | N0 | M0 | Multiple, at least one > 5 cm |
| **IIIB** | T4 | N0 | M0 | Invasion of major branch of portal/hepatic vein, or direct invasion of adjacent organs (excluding gallbladder), or perforation of visceral peritoneum |
| **IVA** | Any T | N1 | M0 | Regional lymph node metastasis |
| **IVB** | Any T | Any N | M1 | Distant metastasis |

### 6.2 Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Staging System

This is the **most widely used staging system for HCC** because, unlike TNM, it integrates **tumour burden + liver function + performance status** and links directly to treatment recommendations.

| BCLC Stage | Tumour Status | Liver Function | PS | Treatment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0 (Very Early)** | Single ≤ 2 cm | Child-Pugh A | 0 | Resection / Ablation / Transplant |
| **A (Early)** | Single or ≤ 3 nodules (each ≤ 3 cm) | Child-Pugh A–B | 0 | Resection / Ablation / Transplant |
| **B (Intermediate)** | Multinodular, large | Child-Pugh A–B | 0 | TACE |
| **C (Advanced)** | Portal invasion, N1, M1 | Child-Pugh A–B | 1–2 | Systemic therapy |
| **D (Terminal)** | Any | Child-Pugh C | 3–4 | Best supportive care |

### 6.3 Child-Pugh Score (Liver Function Classification)

This is indispensable for HCC management. It uses 5 parameters (**"ABCDE" mnemonic: Albumin, Bilirubin, Clotting/PT-INR, Distension/ascites, Encephalopathy**):

| Parameter | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Albumin** (g/L) | > 35 | 28–35 | < 28 |
| **Bilirubin** (µmol/L) | < 34 | 34–51 | > 51 |
| **PT-INR** | < 1.7 | 1.7–2.3 | > 2.3 |
| **Ascites** | None | Mild/controlled | Moderate–severe |
| **Encephalopathy** | None | Grade I–II | Grade III–IV |

| Class | Score | 1-year Survival | 2-year Survival |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | 5–6 | 100% | 85% |
| **B** | 7–9 | 80% | 60% |
| **C** | 10–15 | 45% | 35% |

### 6.4 Hong Kong Liver Cancer (HKLC) Staging System

Developed at **Queen Mary Hospital, HKU** — tailored for the Hong Kong/Asian HBV-dominant population. It differs from BCLC by being **more aggressive with surgical/locoregional treatments** in intermediate-advanced stages, reflecting the better outcomes observed in Asian centres with high surgical expertise. It classifies patients based on:
- ECOG performance status
- Child-Pugh classification
- Tumour extent (intra/extrahepatic, vascular invasion)

---

## 7. Patterns of Spread

***HCC has a characteristic pattern of spread that you must know*** [1][4]:

### 7.1 ***Intrahepatic Metastasis*** [4]
- The **most common** route of spread
- ***Via portal venous circulation*** — tumour invades a portal vein branch, and tumour cells seed downstream portal territories
- This is why you often see **satellite nodules** around the main tumour and in other segments

### 7.2 ***Portal Vein Tumour Thrombus (PVTT)***
- ***High propensity for portal vein invasion*** [4]
- Can extend from segmental branches → main portal vein → even into the superior mesenteric vein
- Consequences:
  - Worsens portal hypertension (→ variceal bleeding, ascites)
  - Makes the non-tumorous liver completely dependent on hepatic arterial supply
  - **Contraindication to TACE** (because embolising the artery when the portal vein is already blocked = ischaemic necrosis of the entire liver)

### 7.3 ***Hepatic Vein Invasion → IVC → Right Heart → Lungs*** [1][4]
- ***Spread through hepatic vein branches*** → IVC → right atrium
- Can form a **tumour "tongue"** extending into the IVC (similar to renal cell carcinoma)
- ***Lung metastasis via hepatic vein dissemination*** [4]

### 7.4 ***Extrahepatic Metastasis*** [1][4]
- **Lung** (most common extrahepatic site) — via hepatic veins/systemic circulation
- **Bone** — often osteolytic, can present with pathological fractures or cord compression
- ***Lymph nodes (porta hepatis)*** [1] — regional spread
- ***Peritoneal metastasis*** [4] — especially after rupture
- **Adrenal glands** [1]
- **Brain** — rare but possible
- ***Usually death precedes extensive metastasis*** [1] — most patients die of liver failure or variceal bleeding before metastases become clinically dominant

---

## 8. Clinical Features

<Callout title="Key Clinical Principle">
***Clinical features: late presentation + absence of pathognomonic symptoms → difficult diagnosis*** [2]. Most patients are **asymptomatic** until the tumour is large ( > 8 cm) or liver function decompensates. This is why **screening** in high-risk groups is so important.
</Callout>

### 8.1 Clinical Presentations — Overview [4]

***The lecture slide from Prof Poon lists 4 major clinical presentations*** [4]:

1. ***Subclinical (detected on screening with AFP and USG in HBsAg carriers or cirrhotic patients)***
2. ***RUQ pain, hepatomegaly***
3. ***Decompensation of cirrhosis (ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy)***
4. ***Intraperitoneal haemorrhage (rupture of HCC)***
5. ***Paraneoplastic features: fever, hypercalcaemia, hypoglycaemia, erythrocytosis***

### 8.2 Symptoms

#### Local Symptoms

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| ***RUQ pain ± right shoulder pain*** [2][4] | **Distension of Glisson's capsule** by the expanding tumour mass. Glisson's capsule is innervated by the lower intercostal nerves and phrenic nerve. Right shoulder pain = **referred pain via the phrenic nerve (C3-C5)** when the tumour irritates the diaphragmatic surface of the liver. |
| **Dull aching/heaviness in RUQ** | Gradual capsular stretching by slow tumour growth |
| **Sudden severe abdominal pain** | ***Rupture of HCC*** → intraperitoneal haemorrhage → acute peritonism. This is a **surgical emergency**. HCC is highly vascular, and large subcapsular tumours can rupture spontaneously. |
| ***Loss of appetite (LOA), loss of weight (LOW)*** [2] | **Tumour cachexia** — mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) secreted by the tumour and host immune system; also mechanical early satiety from hepatomegaly compressing the stomach |
| **Abdominal distension** | ***Ascites*** — from (a) portal hypertension (cirrhosis ± PVTT), (b) peritoneal carcinomatosis, (c) hypoalbuminaemia (failing liver can't synthesise albumin → ↓ oncotic pressure) |
| **Nausea/vomiting** | Liver capsule stretching; also may be due to raised intracranial pressure if brain metastases (rare) |
| **Early satiety** | Hepatomegaly displacing the stomach |

#### Symptoms Related to ***Decompensation of Cirrhosis*** [4]

When HCC develops in a cirrhotic liver, the additional metabolic demand and mass effect can push a previously compensated cirrhosis into decompensation:

| Symptom | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Ascites*** [4] | Portal hypertension (↑ hydrostatic pressure in portal venous system) + hypoalbuminaemia (↓ oncotic pressure) + RAAS activation (Na+ and water retention). PVTT from HCC dramatically worsens portal HT. |
| ***Variceal bleeding (haematemesis/melaena)*** [4] | Portal hypertension → portosystemic collaterals → oesophageal/gastric varices → rupture → life-threatening UGIB |
| ***Hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, drowsiness, asterixis)*** [4] | Liver failure → inability to clear ammonia and other neurotoxins → accumulation in CNS → astrocyte swelling (via glutamine synthesis) → cerebral oedema and dysfunction |
| **Jaundice** | Either (a) failing liver can't conjugate/excrete bilirubin, or (b) ***tumour invasion of biliary tree or compression of intrahepatic ducts*** [2] — **obstructive jaundice is NOT common** in HCC [2] (unlike cholangiocarcinoma) |
| **Peripheral oedema** | Hypoalbuminaemia + portal HT + secondary hyperaldosteronism |
| **Easy bruising / bleeding** | Coagulopathy from ↓ synthesis of clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) by failing liver + thrombocytopenia from hypersplenism |

#### Systemic/Constitutional Symptoms

| Symptom | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Fatigue, malaise** | Chronic disease; cytokine-mediated (IL-6, TNF-α); anaemia |
| ***Fever*** [4] | Tumour necrosis releasing pyrogens; also tumour cells themselves can produce IL-6. Fever of unknown origin can be a presentation of HCC (so-called "tumour fever"). Must exclude infection (e.g. SBP, cholangitis) in a cirrhotic patient. |
| **Night sweats** | Cytokine-mediated, similar to lymphoma |

### 8.3 Signs

#### Hepatic Signs

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| ***Hepatomegaly*** [2][4] | Direct tumour mass effect. The liver may be **massively enlarged**, hard, irregular, and **tender** on palpation. A liver that was previously small and cirrhotic now becoming palpably enlarged should raise suspicion for HCC. |
| **Hepatic bruit / arterial bruit over liver** | Hypervascular tumour → turbulent arterial flow → audible bruit on auscultation over the liver. This is a **relatively specific** sign for HCC (though uncommon). |
| **Hepatic friction rub** | Tumour involving the liver surface → inflammation of overlying peritoneum → palpable/audible friction rub |
| **Hard, irregular, nodular liver** | Tumour nodules within the liver parenchyma |

#### Signs of Cirrhosis and Portal Hypertension

Since 80% of HCC in HK occurs on a cirrhotic background, look for:

| Sign | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Jaundice (scleral icterus)** | ↓ bilirubin conjugation/excretion (hepatocellular) or biliary obstruction |
| **Spider naevi** (> 5 abnormal) | Hyperestrogenism (failing liver can't metabolise oestrogen) → arteriolar vasodilation |
| **Palmar erythema** | Hyperestrogenism → peripheral vasodilation |
| **Gynaecomastia, testicular atrophy** | Hyperestrogenism + ↓ sex hormone-binding globulin synthesis |
| **Caput medusae** | Portal HT → recanalization of umbilical vein → visible periumbilical veins |
| **Splenomegaly** | Portal HT → splenic congestion |
| **Ascites** (shifting dullness, fluid thrill) | Portal HT + hypoalbuminaemia + RAAS activation |
| **Asterixis (liver flap)** | Hepatic encephalopathy → ammonia-mediated disruption of diencephalic motor centres |
| **Fetor hepaticus** | Dimethyl sulfide (from failed hepatic metabolism of mercaptans) in expired air — a sweet, musty odour |
| **Dupuytren's contracture** | Associated with alcoholic liver disease (palmar fibromatosis) |
| **Leuconychia (white nails)** | Hypoalbuminaemia |
| **Clubbing** | Hepatopulmonary syndrome (intrapulmonary vascular dilatation) |
| **Muscle wasting** | Protein-calorie malnutrition; impaired hepatic protein synthesis |

#### Signs of ***Ruptured HCC*** [4]

- **Sudden haemodynamic collapse**: tachycardia, hypotension, pallor, diaphoresis
- **Acute abdomen**: diffuse peritonism (guarding, rigidity, rebound tenderness)
- This is a **life-threatening emergency** (mortality 30–70%)
- Occurs in ~10% of HCC patients, more common with **large, subcapsular tumours**
- Mechanism: the tumour erodes through Glisson's capsule and bleeds into the peritoneal cavity

#### ***Paraneoplastic Signs*** [2][4]

These are **non-metastatic systemic manifestations** caused by bioactive substances secreted by tumour cells. They occur in **~5–10% of HCC patients** and can sometimes be the presenting feature.

| Paraneoplastic Syndrome | Mechanism | Clinical Feature |
|---|---|---|
| ***Erythrocytosis (polycythaemia)*** [2][4] | **Tumour secretes erythropoietin (EPO)** → stimulates erythropoiesis in bone marrow → ↑ RBC mass. Normal liver doesn't produce significant EPO (kidneys do), but HCC cells can ectopically produce it. | Plethoric facies, elevated Hb/Hct |
| ***Hypoglycaemia*** [2][4] | Two mechanisms: (a) ***High metabolic demands of tumour*** consuming glucose, (b) ***Tumour secretes IGF-2 (insulin-like growth factor 2)*** [2] — a large peptide with insulin-like activity that drives glucose uptake. Also, ***secretion of insulin-like peptide (ILP)*** [1] → **excess glycogen in tumour (clear cells)** [1]. Additionally, the failing cirrhotic liver has reduced glycogen stores and impaired gluconeogenesis. | Sweating, confusion, seizures, LOC — can be recurrent and severe |
| ***Hypercalcaemia*** [2][4] | **Tumour secretes PTHrP** (parathyroid hormone-related peptide) → mimics PTH → activates osteoclasts → bone resorption → ↑ serum Ca²⁺. Also ↑ renal calcium reabsorption. | Stones, bones, moans, groans, thrones (renal calculi, bone pain, depression, abdominal pain, polyuria) |
| ***Hypercholesterolaemia*** [2] | **Autonomous cholesterol synthesis** by tumour cells — the normal feedback inhibition (via LDL receptor pathway) is lost in malignant hepatocytes. | Elevated serum cholesterol (usually an incidental lab finding) |
| ***Watery diarrhoea*** [2] | **Tumour secretes VIP** (vasoactive intestinal peptide) → stimulates intestinal secretion of water and electrolytes → secretory diarrhoea (similar to VIPoma). | Profuse watery diarrhoea, hypokalaemia, achlorhydria (WDHA syndrome) |
| ***Dermatomyositis*** [2] | Autoimmune paraneoplastic phenomenon — tumour antigens cross-react with skin and muscle proteins → immune-mediated inflammation | Heliotrope rash (purple eyelids), Gottron's papules (knuckles), proximal muscle weakness |
| ***Leser-Trélat sign*** [2] | ***Explosive onset of multiple seborrheic keratoses*** — mediated by tumour secretion of growth factors (TGF-α, EGF) stimulating keratinocyte proliferation | Sudden appearance of many "stuck on" warty lesions |
| ***Fever*** [4] | Tumour necrosis → release of endogenous pyrogens (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) | Unexplained pyrexia (diagnosis of exclusion) |

<Callout title="Paraneoplastic Syndromes — Exam Tip" type="error">
Students often forget the paraneoplastic features of HCC. The examiners love asking about **erythrocytosis** (because it's counterintuitive — you'd expect anaemia in cancer!) and **hypoglycaemia** (because it's counterintuitive — you'd expect hyperglycaemia in a liver mass!). Know the mechanisms.
</Callout>

#### Signs of Metastatic Disease

| Site | Signs |
|---|---|
| **Lung** | Cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, pleural effusion |
| **Bone** | Bone pain, pathological fractures, cord compression |
| **Brain** | Headache, focal neurological deficits, seizures |
| **Peritoneum** | Ascites (bloody/exudative), Virchow's node (left supraclavicular) |
| **Adrenals** | Usually asymptomatic; rarely adrenal insufficiency if bilateral |

## 9. Screening for HCC

***Screening with AFP and USG in HBsAg carriers or cirrhotic patients*** [4].

### Who to Screen [2]

| Population | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| ***HBV carriers > 40 years old*** | ***USG + AFP every 6 months*** |
| ***HBV carriers with cirrhosis (any age)*** | ***USG + AFP every 6 months*** |
| ***HBV/HCV co-infected with HIV*** | ***USG + AFP every 6 months*** |
| **Cirrhosis of any aetiology** | USG ± AFP every 6 months |
| **Family history of HCC in HBV carrier** | USG + AFP every 6 months (start earlier, e.g. age 20–30) |

### Screening Tools

- **Ultrasound (USG)**: sensitivity ~60–80% for early HCC. Limited by operator dependence, body habitus, and cirrhotic liver background.
- **Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)**: see below.
- ***CUHK-HCC score***: a validated risk prediction model incorporating ***age, albumin, bilirubin, cirrhosis, HBV DNA level*** [2] — helps stratify which HBV carriers need more intensive screening.

<Callout title="Why Screen?">
***Symptoms usually appear only when the tumour is > 8 cm*** [1]. At that size, curative options are limited. Screening aims to detect HCC at BCLC 0/A stage when curative treatments (resection, ablation, transplant) are feasible and 5-year survival is 50–70%.
</Callout>

## 10. Why is the Prognosis So Poor? [1]

This was explicitly addressed in the senior notes and is a favourite exam question:

1. ***Patients present with symptoms at late stage*** — symptoms usually don't appear until the tumour is > 8 cm [1]
2. ***Majority have underlying cirrhosis which limits scope for resection or other interventions*** — you can't resect half the liver if the remaining half is cirrhotic and can barely function [1]
3. ***Early or pre-malignant lesions are present in other parts of the liver*** — ***"field cancerisation"*** — the entire liver is exposed to the oncogenic influence of HBV/HCV/cirrhosis, so even after curative treatment, there's a high risk of a ***2nd primary HCC*** developing [1]
4. ***Early IV spread leads to early metastasis or portal vein thrombosis*** [1]

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Definition**: HCC = primary malignant tumour of hepatocytes; most common primary liver cancer (~80%).

**Epidemiology (HK Focus)**:
- 3rd–2nd commonest cancer death in HK; M:F = 4–6:1; peak 45–55 years
- **80% HBsAg-positive; 80% have cirrhosis**
- HCC:CC = 6:1

**Aetiology**:
- **HBV (80% in HK)** — both indirect (cirrhosis) and direct (HBx, DNA integration) oncogenesis; **20% develop HCC WITHOUT cirrhosis**
- **HCV** — 100% develop HCC on cirrhotic liver (no direct oncogenic effect)
- Alcohol — HCC only via cirrhosis (100%)
- NAFLD/NASH — rising globally; can cause HCC without cirrhosis
- Aflatoxin → p53 R249S mutation (**NOT a risk factor in HK**)

**Pathogenesis**: Chronic injury → regeneration → telomere shortening → genomic instability → telomerase reactivation → loss of p53 → HCC

**Pathology**: Massive/nodular/diffuse; hypervascular; green (bile production); trabecular histology (80%); fibrolamellar variant (young, no cirrhosis, good prognosis)

**Spread**: Intrahepatic (portal vein) > lung (hepatic vein → IVC) > bone > LN > peritoneum > adrenals

**Clinical Presentation**:
- Often asymptomatic until late (> 8 cm)
- RUQ pain (capsular stretch) ± right shoulder (phrenic nerve)
- Decompensated cirrhosis (ascites, variceal bleed, encephalopathy)
- Ruptured HCC (surgical emergency)
- Paraneoplastic: erythrocytosis (EPO), hypoglycaemia (IGF-2), hypercalcaemia (PTHrP), hypercholesterolaemia, watery diarrhoea (VIP)

**Screening**: USG + AFP every 6 months in HBV carriers > 40 years and all cirrhotics

**Prognosis is poor because**: late presentation, cirrhosis limits treatment, field cancerisation, early vascular invasion

      question: "Why can HBV cause HCC in a non-cirrhotic liver, but HCV cannot?",
      markscheme: "HBV is a DNA virus that integrates into the host genome causing insertional mutagenesis and produces oncogenic proteins (HBx, Pre-S1/S2) with direct carcinogenic effect. HCV is an RNA virus that does not integrate into host DNA and causes HCC only indirectly via chronic inflammation leading to cirrhosis. Therefore 20% of HBV-related HCC occurs in non-cirrhotic livers vs 0% for HCV."

    {
      question: "What are the 4 major clinical presentations of HCC as listed by Prof Poon?",
      markscheme: "1. Subclinical (detected on screening with AFP and USG in HBsAg carriers or cirrhotic patients). 2. RUQ pain and hepatomegaly. 3. Decompensation of cirrhosis (ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy). 4. Intraperitoneal haemorrhage from ruptured HCC. Also paraneoplastic features."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain the pathophysiological basis of hypoglycaemia as a paraneoplastic syndrome in HCC.",
      markscheme: "Three mechanisms: 1. High metabolic demands of the tumour consuming glucose. 2. Tumour secretion of IGF-2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) which has insulin-like activity driving glucose uptake by peripheral tissues. 3. Failing cirrhotic liver has reduced glycogen stores and impaired gluconeogenesis. Clear cells in tumour contain excess glycogen."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is TACE contraindicated in the presence of portal vein tumour thrombus?",
      markscheme: "TACE involves embolising the hepatic artery which supplies the tumour. If the portal vein is already occluded by tumour thrombus, the non-tumorous liver parenchyma has lost its portal venous supply and is entirely dependent on hepatic arterial flow. Embolising the artery would therefore cause ischaemic necrosis of the entire liver leading to fatal liver failure."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the multistep carcinogenesis pathway of HCC? Include the role of telomeres.",
      markscheme: "Chronic liver injury causes hepatocyte death and regenerative proliferation. Repeated cell divisions shorten telomeres, leading to genomic instability. Hyperplastic nodules form, then dysplastic nodules develop with moderate genomic instability. Telomerase is reactivated (TERT promoter mutation) granting replicative immortality. Further mutations accumulate including loss of p53 tumour suppressor, leading to well-differentiated then progressively poorly differentiated HCC."
    },
    {
      question: "Name the dominant aetiology of HCC in Hong Kong, the percentage of HCC patients who are HBsAg-positive, and the percentage who have underlying cirrhosis.",
      markscheme: "Hepatitis B virus is the dominant aetiology. 80% of HCC patients in HK are HBsAg-positive. 80% have underlying cirrhosis."
