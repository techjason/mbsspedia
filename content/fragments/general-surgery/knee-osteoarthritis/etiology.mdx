## 1. Definition

Osteoarthritis (OA) — let's break down the name: "osteo" = bone, "arthro" = joint, "itis" = inflammation. Though traditionally thought of as a purely "wear-and-tear" degenerative disease, we now understand it as a **whole-joint disease** involving cartilage, subchondral bone, synovium, ligaments, capsule, and periarticular muscles [1].

**_OA is a whole person disease_** — it is not simply cartilage wearing out. It encompasses susceptibility of joints to damage, failure of repair mechanisms, and the downstream symptomatic and structural consequences [1].

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) specifically refers to the progressive, heterogeneous condition characterised by the degradation of articular cartilage, subchondral bone remodelling, osteophyte formation, and synovial inflammation affecting one or more of the three compartments of the knee joint (medial tibiofemoral, lateral tibiofemoral, patellofemoral) [1][2].

<Callout title="Key Concept">
  KOA is **not** just "cartilage loss." It is a disease of the entire joint
  organ — including subchondral bone sclerosis, synovitis, meniscal
  degeneration, ligament laxity, and periarticular muscle weakness. Think of it
  as "joint failure," analogous to heart failure being failure of the whole
  cardiac system, not just the myocardium.

## 2. Epidemiology

### Global Burden

- **_The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimates almost 1 billion individuals will have OA by the year 2050_** [1].
- **_KOA is a major cause of adult disability worldwide_** [1].
- OA is the most common form of arthritis globally and the single most common cause of disability in older adults.
- Prevalence increases steeply with age: approximately 10% of men and 13% of women aged ≥ 60 have symptomatic KOA.
- The knee is the most commonly affected large joint.

### Hong Kong Context

- **_By 2050, the World Health Organization forecasts that 40% of the population in Hong Kong will be aged 65 or above, ranking fifth in the world_** [1].
- This demographic shift means KOA will become an enormous healthcare burden in Hong Kong — more elderly people = more OA = more joint replacements, more disability, more healthcare costs.
- Secondary OA of the hip is more common in Chinese populations (often related to developmental dysplasia of the hip and AVN), but **primary OA of the knee** is the predominant large-joint OA in Hong Kong [2][3].

### KOA as a Serious Disease

**_OA is a serious disease_** — it is associated with [1]:

- **_Increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disorders_** (because pain and stiffness → reduced physical activity → metabolic syndrome → CV risk)
- **_Increased risks of psychological disorders_** (chronic pain → depression, anxiety)
- **_Increased risks of sleep disturbance_** (nocturnal pain, difficulty repositioning)
- **_Increased risk of mortality_** (likely mediated through reduced mobility, comorbidities, and polypharmacy)

<Callout title="Why Does OA Increase Mortality?" type="idea">
  This surprises many students. The mechanism is indirect: chronic pain →
  immobility → obesity/metabolic syndrome → cardiovascular disease.
  Additionally, NSAIDs used chronically for OA carry their own cardiovascular
  and GI risks. OA patients also have higher rates of depression, which
  independently increases mortality.

## 3. Risk Factors

**_Risk factors for KOA_** can be broadly categorised [1][2][3]:

### 3.1 Non-Modifiable

| Risk Factor             | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Age**                 | **_Aging_** is the strongest risk factor. Cartilage loses water content, proteoglycan concentration decreases, and repair capacity diminishes with age. But note: aging ≠ OA (see biochemical differences below)                                                   |
| **_Female sex_**        | Women have higher prevalence, especially post-menopause — oestrogen has chondroprotective effects; its loss accelerates cartilage degradation. Women also have different knee biomechanics (wider pelvis → increased Q angle → more lateral patellofemoral stress) |
| **Genetics / Heredity** | **_Heredity_** is a recognised primary cause [1]. Polymorphisms in genes encoding collagen type II, aggrecan, and GDF5 contribute to susceptibility                                                                                                                |

### 3.2 Modifiable

| Risk Factor                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Obesity_**                  | **_Osteoarthritis is more common in people at the extremes of body weight_** and **_often takes a toll on weight-bearing joints like the knees, hip_** [1]. Mechanism is twofold: (1) **Mechanical** — increased joint loading (every 1 kg of body weight = ~4 kg of force across the knee during walking); (2) **Metabolic** — adipokines (leptin, adiponectin) and systemic low-grade inflammation from adipose tissue directly damage cartilage, which explains why obese patients also get OA in non-weight-bearing joints like hands |
| **_Injury / Previous trauma_** | **_Acute trauma_** is a major secondary cause [1][2]. ACL tears, meniscal injuries, tibial plateau fractures, and patellar fractures → altered joint biomechanics and direct cartilage damage → post-traumatic OA. A young person with OA knee — always ask about previous trauma and chronic joint instability [2]                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **_Occupation_**               | Repetitive knee loading — farmers, miners, carpet layers, construction workers. Prolonged kneeling and squatting are particularly damaging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Mechanical stress**          | **_Mechanical stress_** is listed as a primary cause [1]. Malalignment (varus/valgus), joint dysplasia, leg length discrepancy all concentrate force on specific compartments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Muscle weakness**            | Quadriceps weakness is both a risk factor and a consequence. The quadriceps act as "shock absorbers" for the knee; weakness → increased impact loading on cartilage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Low bone density**           | Paradoxically listed as a risk factor — the relationship is complex. Higher bone density may actually predispose to OA through stiffer subchondral bone that transmits more stress to cartilage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### 3.3 Secondary Causes (Mnemonic: Think of what damages cartilage or changes loading)

**_Secondary causes_** [1][2]:

- **Defective load (force):** Obesity, occupational overuse
- **Defective load (area):** Joint dysplasia (e.g., developmental dysplasia of the hip)
- **Defective cartilage — damage:** Trauma, haemophilia (recurrent haemarthroses destroy cartilage)
- **Defective cartilage — disease:** Inflammatory arthritis (RA), metabolic (gout, pseudogout/CPPD), infection
- **Unsupported cartilage:** Avascular necrosis (AVN — subchondral bone dies → overlying cartilage collapses)
- **_Surgery_** (e.g., previous meniscectomy removes the "shock absorber" → increased point-loading on cartilage → accelerated OA) [1]
- **_Congenital abnormalities_** [1]
- **_Rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory conditions_** [1]
- **_Diabetes or other hormone disorders_** [1] (diabetes → advanced glycation end-products in cartilage → stiffening and increased susceptibility to damage; also associated with metabolic syndrome)
- **_Infective causes_** → post-septic arthritis OA [1]

<Callout title="Primary vs Secondary OA" type="error">
A common exam trap: **Primary (idiopathic) OA** — elderly patient ( > 70y), no identifiable cause beyond aging. **Secondary OA** — younger patient ( < 50y), there IS a cause (trauma, inflammatory, metabolic, congenital). If a 35-year-old presents with KOA, you MUST look for a secondary cause.
</Callout>

## 4. Anatomy and Function of the Knee Joint

Understanding the anatomy is essential to understanding why OA affects the knee the way it does.

### 4.1 Bony Anatomy

The knee joint is the largest and most complex synovial joint in the body. It comprises **three compartments**:

1. **Medial tibiofemoral compartment** — between the medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau
2. **Lateral tibiofemoral compartment** — between the lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau
3. **Patellofemoral compartment** — between the patella and femoral trochlear groove

**_Three compartments: medial, lateral, patellofemoral_** [2].

**Why is the medial compartment most commonly affected?**

- **_Genu varum (bow-legged alignment) in normal individuals → medial compartment most commonly affected_** [2].
- The mechanical axis of the lower limb normally passes slightly medial to the knee centre. In most people, there is a slight physiological varus, meaning 60–70% of the load is borne by the medial compartment. Over time, this preferential loading accelerates medial compartment wear.

### 4.2 Articular Cartilage

- Hyaline cartilage covers the articular surfaces (femoral condyles, tibial plateaus, posterior surface of patella).
- Composed of: water (65–80%), type II collagen (15–22%), proteoglycans (aggrecan) (4–7%), and chondrocytes ( < 5% of volume).
- **Chondrocytes** are the only cells in cartilage — they produce and maintain the extracellular matrix (ECM). They are avascular, anueral, and alymphatic, receiving nutrition solely by diffusion from synovial fluid.
- **Proteoglycans** (especially aggrecan) attract water via osmotic pressure, giving cartilage its compressive resistance — like a sponge that resists being squeezed.
- **Type II collagen** provides tensile strength — the "rebar" in the concrete.
- Cartilage is **avascular and anueral** — this is why: (1) it has very limited healing capacity, and (2) early cartilage damage is painless (the pain in OA comes from subchondral bone, synovium, capsule, and periarticular structures, NOT from the cartilage itself).

### 4.3 Menisci

- Fibrocartilaginous C-shaped (medial) and O-shaped (lateral) structures sitting on the tibial plateaus.
- Functions: load distribution, shock absorption, joint stability, lubrication, proprioception.
- Loss of meniscus (e.g., after meniscectomy) → reduced contact area → increased point-loading → accelerated OA. This is why meniscal-preserving surgery is preferred over total meniscectomy.

### 4.4 Ligaments

- **ACL and PCL** (cruciate ligaments) — provide anteroposterior stability.
- **MCL and LCL** (collateral ligaments) — provide mediolateral stability.
- Chronic instability from ligament deficiency → abnormal joint kinematics → accelerated OA.

### 4.5 Synovium and Synovial Fluid

- The synovial membrane lines the inner surface of the joint capsule (but NOT the articular cartilage surface).
- Produces synovial fluid — a dialysate of plasma enriched with hyaluronic acid (HA).
- HA provides viscosity and lubrication. In OA, HA concentration and molecular weight decrease → thinner, less protective fluid.

### 4.6 Subchondral Bone

- The layer of bone just beneath the articular cartilage.
- Acts as a "shock absorber" — distributes load from cartilage to cancellous bone.
- In OA, subchondral bone undergoes sclerosis (thickening) and cyst formation — both visible on X-ray.

### 4.7 Lower Limb Alignment

- **_Standing scanogram of bilateral lower limbs_** is used to assess alignment [2].
- **_Tibiofemoral angle (TFA)_**: the angle between the anatomical axes of the femur and tibia. Normal is ~5–7° of valgus.
- **_Mechanical axis of the lower limb_**: a line from the centre of the femoral head to the centre of the ankle. Normally passes through or just medial to the centre of the knee.
  - If it **_passes through the medial side_** → varus malalignment → medial compartment overloaded.
  - If it **_passes through the lateral side_** → valgus malalignment → lateral compartment overloaded [2].

## 5. Pathophysiology

### 5.1 The OA Process — A Whole-Joint Disease

OA is fundamentally a failure of the joint as an organ. The disease process involves all joint tissues simultaneously, though cartilage degradation is the hallmark.

### 5.2 Biochemical Changes: Aging vs OA

**_Biochemical changes of articular cartilage in aging and osteoarthritis_** [4]:

| Parameter                                | Aging                      | Osteoarthritis                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Water content_**                      | **_Decrease_**             | **_Increase_** (early — oedema of cartilage as proteoglycan matrix breaks down and can't retain water in an organised manner)          |
| **_Collagen_**                           | **_Relatively unchanged_** | **_Becomes disorderly; decrease in severe OA_**                                                                                        |
| **_Proteoglycan concentration_**         | **_Decrease_**             | **_Decrease_**                                                                                                                         |
| **_Proteoglycan synthesis_**             | **_Decrease_**             | **_Increase_** (attempted repair — chondrocytes try to compensate but produce inferior quality proteoglycans)                          |
| **_Proteoglycan degradation_**           | **_Decrease_**             | **_Markedly increase_** (this is the key — degradation far outstrips synthesis)                                                        |
| **_Chondroitin sulphate concentration_** | **_Decrease_**             | **_Increase_** (shift in GAG composition — more chondroitin sulphate, less keratan sulphate, reflecting immature/reparative cartilage) |

<Callout title="Aging ≠ OA">
  This table is **high yield**. The key distinction: in aging, everything slows
  down (synthesis AND degradation both decrease). In OA, there is a net
  **catabolic** state — degradation markedly increases and outpaces the
  attempted increase in synthesis. OA is an active, metabolically driven
  process, NOT just passive wear.
</Callout>

### 5.3 Molecular Biology of KOA

**_Biology of OA Knee_** — the molecular cascade [5]:

This is a complex interplay between mechanical stress, inflammation, and failed repair:

#### Step 1: Initiation

- **_Increased loading, cytokines, growth factors, Wnts_** act on chondrocytes [5].
- Mechanical overload → chondrocyte stress → release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).

#### Step 2: Cartilage Degradation

- Stressed chondrocytes upregulate **_ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs)_** and **_MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases)_** [5].
  - **ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5** — "aggrecanases" — cleave aggrecan (the main proteoglycan).
  - **MMP-13** — "collagenase-3" — cleaves type II collagen.
- These enzymes break down the structural framework of cartilage.
- Simultaneously, **_inhibition of Collagen II, Proteoglycan, and TIMP (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases)_** occurs [5] — so not only is destruction increased, but the brakes on destruction are released AND new matrix production is suppressed.

#### Step 3: Synovitis

- **_Cartilage antigens_** (fragments of degraded cartilage) are released into the synovial fluid [5].
- These are taken up by **_synoviocytes_** → triggering synovial inflammation (synovitis) [5].
- **_Inflammatory cytokines and growth factors (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, Wnts)_** are released by activated synoviocytes [5].
- This creates a vicious cycle: cartilage breakdown → synovitis → more cytokines → more cartilage breakdown.

#### Step 4: Immune Cell Involvement

- **_Macrophages (M0)_** are polarised:
  - **_M1 macrophages_** (pro-inflammatory) — release **_TNFα, IL-12, INFγ_** → promote **_Th1_** responses [5].
  - **_M2a macrophages_** — anti-inflammatory but also involved in **_fibrosis via TGFβ_** [5].
  - **_M2c macrophages_** — regulatory [5].
- **_T helper cells (Th0)_** differentiate into:
  - **_Th1_** (pro-inflammatory)
  - **_Th17_** (release **_IL-17_** — potently pro-inflammatory, promotes further MMP production) [5]
  - **_Th2_** (via **_IL-4, IL-13_** — anti-inflammatory)
  - **_Tregs_** (regulatory — via **_IL-10, TGFβ_** — anti-inflammatory) [5]
- The balance is tipped toward pro-inflammatory (Th1/Th17 and M1) in OA.

#### Step 5: Release of Degenerative Enzymes into Joint

- **_Release of cytokines and degenerative enzymes into the synovial fluid_** [5] — amplifies the destruction throughout the joint space.

#### Step 6: Subchondral Bone Changes

- **_Subchondral bone sclerosis_** — thickening of subchondral bone in response to increased mechanical stress (attempted reinforcement) [5].
- **_Osteophyte formation_** — bony spurs at joint margins, driven by **_TGFβ_** and mechanical stress. These are the body's attempt to increase the joint surface area and redistribute load — a failed repair mechanism [5].

#### Step 7: Fibrosis

- **_Fibrosis_** of the joint capsule and synovium occurs, mediated by **_TGFβ_** [5] → contributes to stiffness and reduced ROM.

### 5.4 Natural History

**_Natural history of OA: structural changes before symptoms_** [5]:

```
Molecular changes → Pre-radiographic structural changes (MRI/biomarkers) →
Radiographic changes (X-ray) → Symptoms → End-stage disease (joint failure/death) →
Joint replacement
```

**_Defining Disease State of Osteoarthritis_** [5]:

| Stage                                         | Detection Method     | What's Happening                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Initiation of disease process_**           | **_MRI/Biomarkers_** | **_Changes in the composition of bone, cartilage, other soft tissues_** |
| **_Pre-radiographic_**                        | **_MRI/US_**         | **_Structural changes in bone, cartilage, other soft tissues_**         |
| **_Clinically detectable OA (Radiographic)_** | **_X-ray_**          | **_Structural changes in bone (i.e., joint failure)_** + **_Symptoms_** |
| **_End-stage disease_**                       | Clinical             | **_Joint death_** → **_Joint replacement_**                             |

**_More effective to prevent disease progression by intervention at early stages_** [5].

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl" type="idea">
  This natural history is crucial: by the time you see joint space narrowing on
  X-ray, significant disease is already established. X-rays are relatively
  **insensitive** for early OA. MRI can detect early cartilage changes, bone
  marrow oedema, and synovitis **before** any radiographic change appears. This
  is why there's a push toward earlier detection and intervention.

## 6. Classification

### 6.1 By Aetiology

| Type                     | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary (Idiopathic)** | **_Aging, mechanical stress, heredity_** [1]. No identifiable underlying cause beyond risk factors. More common in elderly > 70y.                                                                                |
| **Secondary**            | Identifiable cause — **_obesity, acute trauma, surgery, congenital abnormalities, RA or other inflammatory conditions, diabetes or other hormone disorders, infective causes_** [1]. More common in young < 50y. |

### 6.2 By Compartment

**_Three compartments: medial, lateral, patellofemoral_** [2]:

- **Medial compartment** — most common (due to physiological varus and medial load concentration)
- **Patellofemoral compartment** — common, especially in women; presents with anterior knee pain worse going downstairs
- **Lateral compartment** — least common in isolation; when present, think of valgus malalignment
- **Tricompartmental** — all three compartments involved; end-stage disease

### 6.3 Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) Classification

**_Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification for OA knee_** [2]:

| Grade         | Description                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **_Grade 0_** | **_No joint space narrowing (JSN)_**     |
| **_Grade 1_** | **_Possible osteophytes, doubtful JSN_** |
| **_Grade 2_** | **_Definite osteophytes_**               |
| **_Grade 3_** | **_Definite JSN_**                       |
| **_Grade 4_** | **_Bone-on-bone deformity_**             |

<Callout title="KL Grading — High Yield">
  **Grade 2** is the radiographic threshold for "definite OA." Grade 4 is
  bone-on-bone — this is end-stage and typically the point where joint
  replacement is considered. Remember: **radiographic severity does not always
  correlate with symptom severity** — some patients with KL grade 4 have minimal
  pain, and some with KL grade 2 are severely symptomatic.
</Callout>

### 6.4 WOMAC Index (Functional Classification)

**_WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index)_** — used to classify OA progression and assess treatment response [2]. It's a patient-reported outcome measure assessing:

- **Pain** (5 questions)
- **Stiffness** (2 questions)
- **Physical function** (17 questions)

Higher scores = worse disease. Used in clinical trials and clinical practice to track disease impact and treatment efficacy.

## 7. Clinical Features

### 7.1 Symptoms

#### 7.1.1 Pain

**_Knee pain_** is the cardinal symptom [2].

- **Character:** Deep, aching, poorly localised.
- **Aggravating factors:** **_Aggravated by exertion, relieved by rest_** [2]. Weight-bearing activities (walking, standing, climbing stairs) worsen pain. This is because mechanical loading on denuded/thinning cartilage transmits force to the innervated subchondral bone beneath.
- **_Worse on going downstairs_** — this specifically implicates the **_patellofemoral joint_** [2]. Why? Going downstairs requires eccentric quadriceps contraction, which compresses the patella against the femoral trochlea with forces up to 3–4× body weight. If the patellofemoral cartilage is damaged, this produces significant pain.
- **Night pain / rest pain:** In advanced OA, pain may occur at rest and disturb sleep — this is a red flag for severe disease (or consider alternative diagnoses like tumour, infection, or inflammatory arthritis).
- **Mechanism of pain in OA:** Cartilage itself is anueral — it cannot generate pain signals. Pain arises from:
  - **Subchondral bone:** Microfractures, increased intraosseous pressure, bone marrow oedema
  - **Synovium:** Synovitis with inflammatory mediators stimulating nociceptors
  - **Joint capsule:** Stretching from effusion, fibrosis
  - **Periarticular structures:** Ligament strain, muscle spasm, bursitis
  - **Osteophytes:** Periosteal irritation at attachment sites

#### 7.1.2 Stiffness

**_Morning stiffness < 30 minutes after immobility_** [2].

- This is an important **differentiator from inflammatory arthritis** where morning stiffness is typically > 60 minutes (RA) or > 30 minutes (inflammatory).
- **Mechanism:** During rest, synovial fluid redistributes away from the cartilage surfaces, and the thickened, fibrotic capsule "sets." With movement, fluid returns and the capsule stretches — stiffness resolves quickly.
- Also called "gelling" — the joint "gels" after a period of inactivity (sitting in a cinema, sleeping overnight) and loosens up with a few minutes of movement.

#### 7.1.3 Swelling

- **Intermittent:** Due to effusion — overproduction of synovial fluid in response to synovitis or mechanical irritation. Comes and goes with activity levels.
- **Continuous:** Due to capsular thickening and osteophyte formation — a permanent structural change.

#### 7.1.4 Deformity

- Progressive deformity develops as cartilage loss becomes asymmetric:
  - **Genu varum (bow-legged):** Medial compartment OA — most common
  - **Genu valgum (knock-kneed):** Lateral compartment OA — less common
- Deformity worsens the biomechanical malalignment → accelerates further cartilage loss in that compartment (vicious cycle).

#### 7.1.5 Instability

- **_Instability_** [2] — patients report the knee "giving way."
- **Mechanism:** Ligament laxity (from chronic stretching by effusion and deformity), quadriceps weakness, and proprioceptive loss from degenerate menisci and ligaments.

#### 7.1.6 Locking

- **_Locking of joints_** [2] — the knee suddenly becomes unable to fully extend.
- **Mechanism:** Loose bodies (fragments of cartilage or osteophytes) become trapped in the joint, or a degenerate meniscal tear flips into the joint space and mechanically blocks movement.
- True locking (mechanical block) must be distinguished from "pseudolocking" (inability to extend due to pain and muscle spasm).

#### 7.1.7 Loss of Function

- Difficulty with activities of daily living (ADLs) — walking, climbing stairs, rising from a chair, putting on shoes/socks.
- Progressively reduced walking distance.

### 7.2 Signs

#### 7.2.1 Gait

- **Antalgic gait:** Shortened stance phase on the affected side — the patient spends less time weight-bearing on the painful leg.
- In advanced bilateral disease, a slow, shuffling, wide-based gait.
- Trendelenburg gait if hip OA coexists.

#### 7.2.2 Alignment and Deformity

- **Genu varum** (most common in KOA) — inspect from the front with patient standing.
- **Genu valgum** — less common, lateral compartment disease.
- **_Joint deformities, e.g., genu varum_** [2].

#### 7.2.3 Swelling

- **Effusion:** Detected by patellar tap test (moderate-large effusion) or bulge/sweep test (small effusion).
- **Bony enlargement:** Hard, non-tender swelling from osteophytes — palpable along the joint margins. Distinguish from soft-tissue swelling of inflammatory arthritis.
- **_Bony enlargement at affected joints_** [2].

#### 7.2.4 Range of Motion

- **_Reduced ROM with crepitations_** [2].
- **Crepitus:** Palpable and/or audible grinding sensation during passive knee movement. Caused by roughened, irregular articular surfaces rubbing against each other and by osteophytes.
- **Flexion deformity:** There are two types [2]:
  - **_Extension lag_** — the patient cannot actively fully extend the knee, but passive full extension is achievable. This is due to **quadriceps weakness** (the muscle can't generate enough force to achieve the last few degrees of extension).
  - **_Fixed flexion contracture_** — the knee cannot be passively fully extended. This is due to **structural changes** — capsular fibrosis, osteophyte impingement, hamstring contracture.

<Callout title="Extension Lag vs Fixed Flexion Contracture" type="error">
  Students commonly confuse these. **Extension lag** = correctable passively
  (muscle problem). **Fixed flexion contracture** = NOT correctable passively
  (structural/mechanical problem). Always check BOTH active and passive
  extension.
</Callout>

#### 7.2.5 Tenderness

- Joint line tenderness — palpable along the medial or lateral joint line (depending on compartment involved).
- Periarticular tenderness — pes anserinus bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome often coexist.

#### 7.2.6 Muscle Wasting

- Quadriceps wasting (especially vastus medialis obliquus — VMO) is common.
- **Mechanism:** Pain → reflex inhibition of the quadriceps (arthrogenic muscle inhibition) → disuse atrophy. This creates a vicious cycle: weaker quads → less shock absorption → more joint loading → more pain → more inhibition.

#### 7.2.7 Temperature

- The joint may be slightly warm in the presence of active synovitis, but NOT as hot as in septic arthritis or crystal arthropathy.

## 8. Radiological Features

### 8.1 The Four Cardinal Features — **_LOSS_** Mnemonic

**_Radiological features (LOSS)_** [2]:

| Feature                     | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Loss of joint space_**   | **_Earliest_** radiographic sign. Due to loss of articular cartilage (cartilage is radiolucent — you see the "space" between bones narrowing as cartilage thins). Asymmetric narrowing is characteristic of OA (cf. symmetric in RA). |
| **_Osteophytes_**           | Bony spurs at joint margins. Represent attempted repair — new bone formation at the periosteum, driven by TGFβ and mechanical stress. The body is trying to increase the surface area to distribute load.                             |
| **_Subchondral sclerosis_** | Increased density (whiteness) of subchondral bone. Represents bone remodelling — increased osteoblastic activity in response to increased mechanical stress. Like callus formation in bone healing, but maladaptive.                  |
| **_Subchondral cysts_**     | Radiolucent areas in subchondral bone. Formed by: (1) intrusion of synovial fluid through microfractures in the damaged subchondral plate, or (2) focal osteonecrosis. Surrounded by sclerotic bone.                                  |

### 8.2 Radiographic Views for KOA

**_Views_** [2]:

| View                                              | What it Shows                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Weight-bearing AP_**                           | **_Medial vs lateral compartment_** joint space. MUST be weight-bearing — non-weight-bearing AP can underestimate joint space narrowing because the cartilage surfaces aren't compressed |
| **Lateral**                                       | **_Anteromedial vs posteromedial_** changes, **_posterior osteophytes_**, patella position (patella alta/baja), tibial slope                                                             |
| **_Skyline (merchant view)_**                     | **_Patellofemoral joint space_** — assess patellofemoral compartment OA, patellar tilt/subluxation                                                                                       |
| **Valgus/Varus stress views**                     | **_Assess medial/lateral joint space_** under stress — useful for evaluating ligament integrity and correctable deformity                                                                |
| **_Standing scanogram of bilateral lower limbs_** | **_Alignment — tibiofemoral angle (TFA): valgus vs varus; mechanical axis of lower limb: pass through medial or lateral side_**                                                          |
| **_Schuss view (30° flexion PA)_**                | **_More sensitive for early OA_** — the posterior femoral condyles bear most load at 30° flexion, so this view reveals posterior cartilage loss that may be missed on full-extension AP  |

<Callout title="Weight-Bearing X-rays Are Essential" type="error">
  A non-weight-bearing X-ray can miss significant joint space narrowing.
  **Always request weight-bearing views for suspected KOA.** If a patient has a
  "normal" knee X-ray but was done non-weight-bearing, it doesn't rule out OA.
</Callout>

## 9. Degenerative vs Inflammatory Arthritis — Key Distinctions

This comparison is extremely high-yield for exams [2]:

| Feature                          | Degenerative (OA)                                                                               | Inflammatory (e.g., RA)                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Joint involvement_**          | **_Weight-bearing joints: knee, hip, L-spine, C-spine. Small hand joints: 1st CMC joint, IPJ_** | **_Any joint_** (typically MCP, PIP, wrist in RA)                                                  |
| **_Bone density_**               | **_Preserved_** (bone is being remodelled, not resorbed)                                        | **_Juxta-articular osteopenia (RA)_** — inflammatory mediators activate osteoclasts near the joint |
| **_Periarticular bony erosion_** | **_No_**                                                                                        | **_Yes (RA)_** — pannus erodes bone                                                                |
| **_Reactive bony changes_**      | **_Yes_** (osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis — attempted repair)                               | **_No (RA)_** — destruction without repair                                                         |
| Morning stiffness                | < 30 minutes                                                                                    | > 60 minutes (RA)                                                                                  |
| Effusion quality                 | Non-inflammatory (WBC < 2000/mm³)                                                               | Inflammatory (WBC 2,000–50,000/mm³)                                                                |
| Hand involvement                 | DIP (Heberden's nodes), PIP (Bouchard's nodes), 1st CMC                                         | MCP, PIP, wrist (spares DIP)                                                                       |

## 10. Special Features in Hand OA (Brief, for Context)

While the focus is KOA, hand OA features are often tested in comparison:

- **_Heberden's nodes_** — bony enlargement at DIP joints (osteophytes)
- **_Bouchard's nodes_** — bony enlargement at PIP joints
- **_1st CMC joint_** (base of thumb) — **grind test** positive (axial compression + rotation reproduces pain)
- **_UL joints generally spared except 1st CMC and IPJ_** [2]

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Definition:** KOA = whole-joint disease (not just cartilage) involving cartilage degradation, subchondral bone remodelling, osteophyte formation, and synovitis in the three knee compartments.

**Epidemiology:** ~1 billion affected globally by 2050. In Hong Kong, 40% population > 65 by 2050. KOA increases mortality via CV disease, depression, immobility.

**Risk Factors:** Age, female sex, obesity (mechanical + metabolic), previous trauma, occupation, malalignment, muscle weakness, genetics. Secondary causes in young patients — always look for a cause.

**Pathophysiology:** Catabolic > anabolic. ADAMTS + MMPs degrade cartilage matrix → cartilage fragments trigger synovitis → IL-1, IL-6, TNF → more MMP release → vicious cycle. Subchondral bone sclerosis and osteophytes are failed repair attempts.

**Aging vs OA (High Yield Table):** In aging, both synthesis and degradation decrease. In OA, degradation markedly increases while synthesis increases insufficiently → net cartilage loss.

**Clinical Features:** Pain (worse with activity, better with rest; going downstairs = patellofemoral), stiffness ( < 30 min), swelling, deformity (genu varum most common), crepitus, reduced ROM. Extension lag (muscle) vs fixed flexion contracture (structural).

**Radiology — LOSS:** Loss of joint space (earliest), Osteophytes, Subchondral sclerosis, Subchondral cysts. Always weight-bearing AP + skyline. KL grading: Grade 2 = definite OA, Grade 4 = bone-on-bone.

**Key Distinction:** OA = preserved bone density, osteophytes, no erosions. RA = osteopenia, erosions, no osteophytes.
