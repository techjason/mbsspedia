## Complications of Knee Osteoarthritis

Complications of KOA can be divided into two broad categories: (A) **complications of the disease itself** (what happens if OA progresses untreated or inadequately treated), and (B) **complications of treatment** (particularly surgical complications, which are heavily tested in exams). Let's go through both systematically.

---

### A. Complications of the Disease Itself

#### 1. Progressive Joint Destruction and Deformity

- **Mechanism:** OA is a progressive disease. Without intervention, the catabolic cycle of cartilage degradation → synovitis → more degradation continues relentlessly. Asymmetric cartilage loss leads to progressive malalignment.
- **Genu varum** (most common) — progressive medial compartment cartilage loss → the medial joint space collapses → the tibia angulates into varus → this increases medial loading further → vicious cycle of accelerating medial wear.
- **Genu valgum** — less common, occurs with lateral compartment predominance.
- ***End-stage disease (joint death)*** [5] — complete loss of cartilage (bone-on-bone), severe deformity, and essentially a "dead" joint that can only be salvaged by replacement.
- **Fixed flexion contracture** — progressive capsular fibrosis, posterior osteophyte impingement, and hamstring contracture lead to inability to fully extend the knee. This significantly impairs gait (the knee cannot fully extend during stance phase → shortened stride length → increased energy expenditure → reduced walking distance).

#### 2. Loss of Function and Disability

- KOA is the leading cause of mobility disability in older adults.
- Progressive pain and stiffness → reduced walking distance → inability to perform ADLs (climbing stairs, rising from a chair, putting on shoes) → loss of independence → need for assistive devices → eventual wheelchair dependence in severe cases.
- ***KOA is a major cause of adult disability*** [1].

#### 3. Muscle Wasting and Weakness

- **Quadriceps atrophy** — the most important muscular consequence.
- **Mechanism:** Pain → arthrogenic muscle inhibition (a reflex mediated by joint mechanoreceptors that suppresses quadriceps motor neuron activation) → disuse atrophy. This is NOT simply "the patient isn't using their leg" — it is an active neurological inhibition that occurs even if the patient tries to use their quads.
- Weak quadriceps → reduced dynamic knee stabilisation → more abnormal joint loading → more cartilage damage → more pain → more inhibition. A true vicious cycle.

#### 4. Systemic Complications — OA as a Serious Disease

***OA is a serious disease*** [1]:

| Systemic Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Increased risk of cardiovascular/respiratory disorder*** [1] | Chronic pain → immobility → reduced physical activity → weight gain → metabolic syndrome (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance) → atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Additionally, chronic NSAID use for OA pain carries independent cardiovascular and renal risk |
| ***Increased risks of psychological disorder*** [1] | Chronic pain → depression, anxiety, social isolation. Loss of independence and inability to participate in previously enjoyed activities → grief and reduced self-worth. Depression in turn amplifies pain perception (central sensitisation) — another vicious cycle |
| ***Increased risks of sleep disturbance*** [1] | Nocturnal pain (especially in advanced OA with rest pain), difficulty repositioning in bed due to stiffness, depression-related insomnia. Poor sleep → fatigue → reduced pain coping → worsening function |
| ***Increased risk of mortality*** [1] | Not directly from the joint disease, but mediated through: (1) reduced physical activity → cardiovascular death, (2) depression → suicide/neglect of other health conditions, (3) polypharmacy (NSAIDs, opioids) → GI bleeding, renal failure, falls, (4) immobility → venous thromboembolism. OA patients have a 1.5× increased all-cause mortality compared to age-matched controls without OA |

<Callout title="OA Kills — Indirectly">
Students are often surprised that OA increases mortality. The mechanism is entirely indirect — through immobility, metabolic syndrome, depression, and treatment side effects. This is why the emphasis on exercise and weight loss is so important: you're not just treating a sore knee, you're potentially reducing cardiovascular mortality.
</Callout>

#### 5. Secondary Meniscal and Ligament Degeneration

- As cartilage thins and joint congruence is lost, the menisci bear disproportionate load → **degenerative meniscal tears**. These are extremely common in OA (found incidentally on MRI in the majority of patients with KL Grade 3–4).
- Chronic effusion stretches the joint capsule and ligaments → **ligamentous laxity** → instability → giving way → further abnormal joint loading.
- Cruciate ligament degeneration (especially the ACL) is common in advanced KOA — the ACL becomes attenuated, mucoid, and eventually functionally incompetent.

#### 6. Baker's Cyst (Popliteal Cyst)

- **Mechanism:** Chronic synovitis → excess synovial fluid production → fluid herniates through a weak point in the posterior capsule (usually the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa) → formation of a popliteal cyst.
- Usually asymptomatic but can cause posterior knee pain, stiffness, and a palpable mass.
- **Complication of Baker's cyst:** Rupture → fluid dissects into the calf → acute calf pain and swelling mimicking **deep vein thrombosis** (pseudothrombophlebitis syndrome). Always consider ruptured Baker's cyst in the differential of acute calf swelling in an OA patient.

#### 7. Falls and Fractures

- KOA patients have a significantly increased fall risk due to: quadriceps weakness, proprioceptive loss, pain-induced gait abnormalities, and medication side effects (NSAIDs → dizziness; opioids → sedation).
- ***Elderly patients are at particular risk of experiencing side effects — sedation and dizziness which predispose to falls and fractures*** [9] (in the context of opioid use, but the fall risk applies broadly).
- Falls → fractures (hip, distal radius, vertebral) → further immobility → further deconditioning → accelerated disability.

#### 8. Chronic Pain Sensitisation

- In longstanding KOA, peripheral nociceptor sensitisation (from chronic synovitis and subchondral bone damage) can lead to **central sensitisation** — where the central nervous system amplifies pain signals even from normal mechanical stimuli.
- Clinically manifests as: allodynia (pain from normally non-painful stimuli), hyperalgesia (exaggerated pain response), and pain that is disproportionate to the radiographic severity.
- Central sensitisation explains the poor correlation between X-ray severity and symptom severity in some patients, and also explains why some patients continue to have pain even after a technically perfect TKR (10–20% of TKR patients have persistent pain).

### B. Complications of Treatment

#### 1. Complications of Pharmacological Treatment

| Treatment | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **NSAIDs** | GI bleeding/peptic ulcer | COX-1 inhibition → reduced gastric mucosal prostaglandins → impaired mucus/bicarbonate barrier |
| | Renal impairment | Prostaglandin-mediated afferent arteriolar vasodilation is blocked → reduced GFR, sodium/water retention |
| | Cardiovascular events (MI, stroke) | COX-2 inhibition → reduced endothelial prostacyclin → prothrombotic state |
| | Hypertension | Renal sodium retention + reduced vasodilatory prostaglandins |
| **Paracetamol** | ***Liver function abnormalities*** [9] | Hepatotoxicity from accumulation of the toxic metabolite NAPQI when glutathione stores are depleted |
| | ***Elderly people with impaired paracetamol clearance*** [9] | Reduced hepatic metabolism → toxicity at standard doses |
| **Opioids** | ***Drug abuse and addiction*** [9] | Mu-opioid receptor agonism → dopamine release in nucleus accumbens → reward pathway activation → dependence |
| | ***Sedation and dizziness → falls and fractures*** [9] | CNS depression, vestibular effects, postural hypotension |
| | ***Pre-operative opioid use → opioid requirement post-surgery, prolonged hospital stay, greater in-hospital complications, early revision surgery*** [9] | Opioid tolerance → need higher doses peri-operatively; opioid-induced hyperalgesia; impaired wound healing and immune function |
| **IA corticosteroid** | Accelerated cartilage loss (with repeated injections) | Direct chondrotoxicity — steroids suppress chondrocyte matrix synthesis and promote apoptosis |
| | Septic arthritis | Introduction of bacteria during injection (rare but devastating — ~1 in 10,000–50,000 injections) |
| | Peri-injection flare | Crystal-induced synovitis from the steroid suspension itself (self-limiting, 24–48 hours) |
| | Skin/fat atrophy, depigmentation at injection site | Local steroid effect on subcutaneous tissue |

#### 2. Complications of Arthroscopic Surgery

***Limited role of Knee Arthroscopy in OA Knee*** [9]:

- ***Adverse outcomes — DVT (0.4%), PE (0.1%), death (0.03%)*** [9]
- ***Increases rate of progression of osteoarthritis*** [9] — arthroscopic instruments can damage the already thin, friable cartilage surface, and lavage disrupts the synovial fluid environment.
- ***Shortens time to joint replacement*** [9]
- ***Complications of knee arthroscopy: damage to saphenous nerve and vein, peroneal nerve, popliteal vessels*** [6]

> The key teaching point here: arthroscopy for OA is not a benign "keyhole" procedure — it carries real risks and can actually make the disease worse.

***No evidence: arthroscopic debridement, arthroscopic chondroplasty (drill holes)*** [12].

#### 3. Complications of Osteotomy (HTO)

| Complication | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Under-correction / Over-correction | If the mechanical axis is not shifted to the desired point (Fujisawa point), the procedure fails (under-correction) or overloads the opposite compartment (over-correction → lateral compartment OA) |
| Non-union / Delayed union | The osteotomy site may fail to heal, especially in smokers, obese patients, or with inadequate fixation |
| Infection | As with any open surgical procedure |
| Peroneal nerve palsy | The common peroneal nerve wraps around the fibular neck very close to the lateral tibial osteotomy site — at risk during lateral closing-wedge osteotomy |
| Compartment syndrome | Rare but possible — post-operative swelling in the anterior compartment |
| Hardware-related pain | Plates and screws may cause discomfort and require removal |
| Conversion to TKR may be more technically difficult | The altered tibial anatomy can complicate subsequent TKR, though this is generally manageable |

#### 4. Complications of Arthroplasty (UKA and TKR)

These are the **most commonly tested** complications and are categorised by timing:

##### Specific complications of total replacement [12]:

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism / Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| ***Immediate (intraoperative)*** | ***Bone fracture*** | Intraoperative fracture of the femur or tibia during preparation of the bone surfaces or component insertion. Risk factors: osteoporotic bone, excessive force |
| | ***Vascular injury — popliteal artery in TKR*** | The popliteal artery lies directly behind the posterior capsule of the knee. During posterior capsule release or tibial cut, the artery is at risk, especially in revision surgery or severe fixed flexion contracture. TKR-specific; cf ***femoral artery in THR*** [12] |
| | ***Nerve injury — common peroneal nerve (CPN) in TKR*** | The CPN wraps around the fibular neck, lateral and superficial. At risk during lateral release, valgus correction, or from post-operative haematoma/swelling. Presents as foot drop (weakness of ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension, sensory loss over dorsum of foot). Cf ***sciatic nerve in THR*** [12] |
| ***Early (post-operative)*** | ***DVT / PE*** | Venous stasis (immobility during surgery, tourniquet use, post-op bed rest) + endothelial injury (surgical trauma) + hypercoagulability (post-operative inflammation) = Virchow's triad. TKR has one of the highest rates of VTE of any elective surgery. Prophylaxis: LMWH, mechanical (TED stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression), early mobilisation |
| | ***Infection — difficult to detect and treat*** [12] | Early post-operative infection ( < 4 weeks): acute presentation with wound erythema, swelling, pyrexia, raised CRP. Often haematogenous (Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis). Treatment: washout ± liner exchange (DAIR: debridement, antibiotics, implant retention) if within 4 weeks with well-fixed components. Late infection: may require two-stage revision (remove prosthesis → antibiotic spacer → 6 weeks IV antibiotics → re-implantation) |
| | **Wound complications** | Dehiscence, haematoma, persistent drainage. The anterior knee has relatively poor blood supply → wound healing is slower than many other surgical sites |
| | **Stiffness / Arthrofibrosis** | Excessive scar tissue formation within the joint. Risk factors: poor pre-operative ROM, inadequate post-operative physiotherapy, infection. May require manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA) if ROM remains < 90° at 6–12 weeks post-op |
| ***Late*** | ***Leg length discrepancy (LLD)*** [12] | ***Must counsel patients beforehand*** [12]. In TKR, LLD is less common than in THR, but can occur due to component positioning, ligament balancing, or correction of pre-operative flexion contracture (straightening the knee effectively "lengthens" the leg). In THR, LLD is more common due to femoral offset and neck length choices |
| | ***Prosthesis infection (late/chronic)*** [12] | Can occur months to years after surgery via haematogenous seeding (from dental procedures, UTI, skin infection). Insidious onset: persistent pain, elevated ESR/CRP, loosening on X-ray. Biofilm formation on the prosthesis makes antibiotic penetration poor → often requires prosthesis removal |
| | ***Patellar instability*** [12] | Lateral patellar subluxation or dislocation after TKR. Caused by: component malrotation (especially internal rotation of the femoral or tibial component), inadequate lateral release, pre-existing patellar maltracking. Presents as anterior knee pain, catching, giving way |
| | **Aseptic loosening** | The most common cause of late TKR failure. The prosthesis-cement-bone interface degrades over time due to polyethylene wear debris → macrophage activation → osteolysis (bone resorption around the implant) → loosening. Presents as recurrent pain, radiolucent lines around components on X-ray |
| | **Polyethylene wear** | The polyethylene insert between the metal femoral and tibial components wears over time. Wear particles trigger osteolysis (see above). Modern highly cross-linked polyethylene has reduced but not eliminated this |
| | **Periprosthetic fracture** | Fracture of the bone adjacent to the prosthesis, usually from a fall. Risk factors: osteoporosis, female, advanced age. Management depends on fracture location and prosthesis stability — may require ORIF or revision surgery |

##### UKA vs TKR — Complication Comparison

***UKA: Safer Surgery (Early Perioperative Medical Complications)*** [9]:

***In a study comparing postop complications between UKA and TKA using Medicare data, it was found that the rates of wound complication, myocardial infarction, periprosthetic joint infection, pulmonary embolism, and stiffness were significantly higher among TKA recipients*** [9].

This makes intuitive sense: UKA is a smaller operation (less bone resection, no tourniquet or shorter tourniquet time, smaller incision, less blood loss, faster surgery) → less physiological insult → fewer perioperative complications. However, UKA has a ***higher revision rate compared to TKR*** [2] because progression of OA in the unresurfaced compartments or bearing dislocation may necessitate conversion to TKR.

| Complication | UKA | TKR |
|---|---|---|
| Perioperative medical complications | Lower | Higher |
| Wound complications | Lower | Higher |
| MI, PE | Lower | Higher |
| Periprosthetic infection | Lower | Higher |
| Stiffness | Lower | Higher |
| Revision rate | ***Higher*** [2] | Lower |
| Long-term survival | ~85–90% at 15 years | ~90–95% at 15 years |

### C. Post-Operative Management and Expected Outcomes

***Post-op*** [12]:
- ***Early mobilisation (1 day after operation)*** — crucial for VTE prevention, maintaining quadriceps function, preventing stiffness.
- ***Avoid contact sports, extreme ROM*** [12].
- ***Survival of replacement (not requiring revision surgery): 15–20 years*** [12].

> The expected lifespan of a modern TKR is 15–25 years. This is why we prefer non-surgical management in younger patients — a 50-year-old who gets a TKR may need a revision at age 65–70, and revision TKR is a much bigger, more complex operation with worse outcomes. This underpins the rationale for HTO (buy time) or UKA (easier to revise to TKR) in younger patients.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Disease complications:** Progressive deformity (varus most common), fixed flexion contracture, quadriceps wasting (arthrogenic inhibition), loss of function/disability, Baker's cyst (± rupture mimicking DVT), secondary meniscal/ligament degeneration, falls/fractures, central pain sensitisation. Systemic: increased CV/respiratory risk, depression, sleep disturbance, increased mortality — OA is a SERIOUS disease.

**Treatment complications:**
- NSAIDs: GI bleeding, renal impairment, CV events.
- Paracetamol: liver function abnormalities, especially in elderly.
- Opioids: addiction, sedation/falls, worse surgical outcomes.
- Arthroscopy in OA: DVT/PE/death, accelerates OA progression, shortens time to TKR. No evidence for debridement/chondroplasty.
- TKR specific complications: Immediate (fracture, popliteal artery injury, CPN palsy), Early (DVT/PE, infection — difficult to detect and treat), Late (LLD — must counsel, prosthesis infection, patellar instability, aseptic loosening, periprosthetic fracture).
- UKA is safer perioperatively (lower rates of wound complications, MI, PE, infection, stiffness) but has higher revision rate than TKR.
- Prosthesis survival: 15–20 years.
