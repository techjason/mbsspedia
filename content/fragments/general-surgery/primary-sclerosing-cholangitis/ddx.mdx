## Differential Diagnosis of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis

### The Clinical Problem — Why Is the DDx Important?

Before we list the differentials, let's understand the clinical scenario you're actually working with. A patient with PSC typically presents with one or more of the following:

1. **Cholestatic liver biochemistry** — elevated ALP/GGT out of proportion to transaminases
2. **Biliary strictures on imaging** — multifocal strictures with segmental dilatation on MRCP/ERCP
3. **Clinical cholestasis** — jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, pale stools
4. **Known IBD** with incidental abnormal LFTs

The differential diagnosis therefore needs to address **two overlapping clinical questions**:
- What else causes a **cholestatic biochemical pattern**?
- What else causes **biliary strictures** on cholangiography?

These are not the same list, and the approach differs depending on which "entry point" brought the patient to your attention.

### Systematic Framework for the Differential

I like to organise this by thinking about **what level of the biliary tree is affected** and **what mechanism is causing the damage**. This mirrors how you'll actually reason at the bedside.

### Detailed Differential Diagnosis

#### A. Conditions That Mimic PSC on Cholangiography (Biliary Strictures)

These are the "secondary sclerosing cholangitis" mimics — conditions that produce a cholangiographic picture similar to PSC but have an **identifiable cause** [1][2].

| Condition | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Mimics PSC |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***IgG4-associated cholangitis (IAC)*** | ***Elevated serum IgG4 > 135 mg/dL; mostly elderly male***; associated with autoimmune pancreatitis type 1; dense IgG4+ plasma cell infiltrate on biopsy; ***responds to corticosteroids*** (PSC does not) [2] | Causes multifocal biliary strictures involving intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts, can look identical to PSC on MRCP |
| **Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC)** | ***"Hong Kong disease"***; ***intrahepatic pigment stones and intrahepatic biliary obstruction***; ***usually starts in left intrahepatic ducts***; associated with parasitic infection (***Clonorchis sinensis***); equal M:F; peak in 30–40s [6][12] | Causes intrahepatic strictures with dilated ducts; but key difference: stones are present within bile ducts (brown pigment/calcium bilirubinate), strictures predominantly left-sided, history of recurrent cholangitis episodes |
| **Cholangiocarcinoma** | ***Adenocarcinoma of bile duct ( > 90%)***; ***association with ulcerative colitis (common in Westerners) and recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (common in Orientals)***; raised CA 19-9 (though non-specific); ***mostly occurs in patients > 50 years*** [9][13][14] | Can produce a dominant stricture that mimics PSC; in fact, cholangiocarcinoma can arise *within* PSC (10–20% lifetime risk). Any new dominant stricture in a PSC patient must be investigated with brush cytology |
| **Choledocholithiasis** | Intermittent obstructive jaundice with pain; stone visible on USG/MRCP; ***stone causes painful jaundice*** (vs painless in tumour) [8][15] | CBD stones can cause localised strictures from chronic inflammation, but the pattern is focal, not multifocal |
| **Surgical / ischaemic biliary trauma** | History of cholecystectomy, liver transplantation (hepatic artery thrombosis), or critical illness (ICU cholangiopathy) | Ischaemic injury to peribiliary vascular plexus → bile duct necrosis → strictures. Distribution often follows vascular territory rather than the "beaded" pattern of PSC |
| **HIV cholangiopathy** | Advanced HIV/AIDS (CD4 < 100); caused by opportunistic infections — CMV, Cryptosporidium, Microsporidium | Papillary stenosis + intrahepatic sclerosing cholangitis pattern; responds to HAART and treatment of opportunistic infection |
| **Recurrent pancreatitis** | History of recurrent acute pancreatitis; stricture typically involves distal CBD (intrapancreatic portion) | Chronic pancreatic inflammation → fibrosis around the intrapancreatic CBD → distal stricture. Focal, not multifocal |
| **Chronic bacterial cholangitis** | Recurrent biliary infections from structural abnormalities (post-surgical, biliary-enteric anastomosis) | Repeated infection → chronic inflammation → strictures. History is key |

<Callout title="RPC vs PSC — A Hong Kong Favourite" type="error">

This distinction is extremely high-yield for HKU exams:

| Feature | PSC | RPC |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Geography | Western > > Asian | ***Southeast Asia ("Hong Kong disease")*** [6] |
| Sex | Male predominance (2:1) | Equal M:F |
| Stones | Not a primary feature | ***Intrahepatic pigment/calcium bilirubinate stones*** — formed de novo in ducts |
| Duct preference | Both intrahepatic + extrahepatic | ***Left intrahepatic ducts predominantly*** |
| Stricture type | Multifocal, beaded, both intra- and extrahepatic | Focal areas of stricturing with stone-related dilatation |
| IBD association | 60–80% have UC | None |
| Parasites | Not associated | ***Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini*** |
| Pathogenesis | Immune-mediated periductal fibrosis | ***Stasis + Stricturing + Recurrent infection*** cycle [6] |

</Callout>

#### B. Conditions That Mimic PSC Biochemically (Cholestatic LFT Pattern)

These conditions present with elevated ALP/GGT but may not produce biliary strictures visible on cholangiography.

| Condition | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It's in the DDx |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)** | ***Extreme female predominance (90–95%)***; age 30–65; ***AMA positive at titre ≥ 1:40***; targets ***small intralobular bile ducts*** (not visible on MRCP); associated with Sjögren's, scleroderma, Hashimoto's [16] | Both cause cholestatic LFTs (elevated ALP/GGT), pruritus, fatigue, and eventually cirrhosis. The cholangiogram is **normal** in PBC (small ducts not visible on MRCP). AMA is the key serological discriminator |
| **PSC-AIH overlap syndrome** | Features of both PSC (biliary strictures) and AIH (elevated transaminases > 5× ULN, positive ANA/SMA, interface hepatitis on biopsy); more common in children/young adults [1] | Important to recognise because it responds to immunosuppression (corticosteroids ± azathioprine), unlike pure PSC |
| **Drug-induced cholestasis** | Temporal association with offending drug; common culprits: amoxicillin-clavulanate, erythromycin, anabolic steroids, oral contraceptives, chlorpromazine | Drugs can cause bland cholestasis (no hepatocyte damage) or cholestatic hepatitis. No biliary strictures on imaging. Resolves with drug withdrawal |
| **Viral hepatitis (cholestatic phase)** | Acute hepatitis A/E can have a cholestatic phase; HBV/HCV can cause cholestatic flares; serology positive [15] | Transaminases usually markedly elevated (>10× ULN) alongside cholestatic enzymes — this is not the PSC pattern where ALP dominates |
| **Alcoholic hepatitis / Alcoholic liver disease** | History of heavy alcohol use; AST:ALT ratio > 2:1 ("De Ritis ratio"); elevated GGT; may have cholestatic pattern in severe cases [15] | Can cause cholestatic LFTs; history and the typical AST > ALT pattern differentiate |
| **Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)** | Metabolic syndrome; obesity; USS shows fatty liver; liver biopsy shows steatohepatitis, ballooning | Occasionally presents with mildly elevated ALP; usually hepatitic pattern predominates |
| **Sarcoidosis** | Non-caseating granulomas; elevated ACE; bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on CXR; granulomatous hepatitis | Hepatic sarcoidosis can produce cholestatic LFTs and even intrahepatic cholestasis mimicking PBC or small-duct PSC |
| **Infiltrative liver diseases** | Amyloidosis, lymphoma, metastatic disease; ALP markedly elevated | Infiltration of hepatic parenchyma → elevated ALP; imaging usually shows hepatomegaly ± focal lesions rather than biliary strictures |

---

#### C. Conditions That Overlap with PSC (the "Overlap Syndromes")

| Condition | Key Features |
|:---|:---|
| **PSC-AIH overlap** | ~5–10% of PSC patients; defined by elevated IgG, positive ANA or SMA, and **interface hepatitis** on liver biopsy superimposed on cholangiographic PSC. ***Reserved for patients with suspected small duct PSC or if an overlap syndrome with autoimmune hepatitis are suspected*** — this is when liver biopsy is indicated [1] |
| **IgG4-associated sclerosing cholangitis** | Can coexist with or mimic PSC; ***serum IgG4 is a characteristic marker of autoimmune pancreatitis but is also elevated in patients with PSC*** (~9–15% of PSC patients have elevated IgG4 without having true IgG4-SC) [1] |
| **Small-duct PSC** | Normal MRCP/ERCP but histological features of PSC on liver biopsy; presents with cholestatic LFTs ± IBD; better prognosis; ~20% progress to large-duct PSC |

---

#### D. Conditions That Cause Obstructive Jaundice at Specific Levels (Anatomical DDx)

This is how surgeons think about it — based on where the obstruction is on imaging [8][15]:

| Level of Obstruction | Differential Diagnoses |
|:---|:---|
| ***Hilum*** | ***CA Gallbladder, HCC, Klatskin's tumour, Mirizzi syndrome, Porta lymphadenopathy, PSC, RPC*** [8] |
| ***Mid-CBD*** | ***CA CBD, CA Head of pancreas, Lymphadenopathy*** [8] |
| ***Distal CBD*** | ***Bile duct strictures, Periampullary carcinoma, Choledochal cysts, Pancreatic cysts, Chronic pancreatitis*** [8] |

### The PSC vs PBC Comparison — High-Yield Table

This comparison comes up in virtually every hepatology exam. Know it cold.

| Feature | PSC | PBC |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Sex** | Male (2:1) | ***Female (90–95%)*** [16] |
| **Age** | 30–40 | 30–65 |
| **Duct size affected** | Medium and large (intra + extrahepatic) | ***Small intralobular*** |
| **Cholangiogram** | "Beaded" strictures (MRCP/ERCP) | **Normal** (ducts too small to see) |
| **AMA** | ***Typically absent*** [1] | ***Positive ≥ 1:40 (>95%)*** [16] |
| **p-ANCA** | ***Positive (30–80%)*** [1] | Usually negative |
| **ANA/SMA** | Variable | May be positive (~50%) |
| **IgM** | ***Elevated (40–50%)*** [1] | Markedly elevated |
| **IBD association** | ***Strong (UC 60–80%)*** [1] | None |
| **Associated conditions** | UC, cholangiocarcinoma, CRC | ***Sjögren's, scleroderma, Hashimoto's, RA*** [16] |
| **Response to UDCA** | Controversial; does NOT alter natural history | Proven benefit; slows progression |
| **Histology** | "Onion-skin" periductal fibrosis | Non-suppurative destructive cholangitis (florid duct lesion) |
| **Malignancy risk** | Cholangiocarcinoma (10–20%), CRC, GB cancer | Low |
| **Liver transplantation** | Definitive treatment; but can recur post-transplant (~20%) | Definitive treatment; recurrence uncommon |

### Differentiating Stone vs Tumour in Obstructive Jaundice

When a PSC patient develops worsening jaundice, you need to determine whether it's from the PSC itself (dominant stricture), a superimposed stone, or — critically — a **cholangiocarcinoma**. The classic stone vs tumour distinction applies [8][15]:

| Feature | Stone | Tumour |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Jaundice** | ***Intermittent*** (stone may pass) | ***Progressive*** |
| **Pain** | ***Painful*** (stone passing through ampulla) | ***Painless*** (until advanced); except ***CA pancreatic head: well innervated, spread to coeliac ganglion early*** [15] |
| **Fever/infection** | ***More likely*** (bile stasis → ascending infection) | Until late stage |
| **Constitutional symptoms** | Absent | ***LOW, LOA, night sweats*** [15] |
| **Courvoisier's sign** | Negative (chronic inflammation → fibrotic, non-distensible GB) | Positive if distal obstruction |

> ***"Painless progressive obstructive jaundice in elderly is malignant biliary obstruction until proven otherwise"*** [8].

<Callout title="Exam Trap — Dominant Stricture in PSC" type="error">
A dominant stricture in PSC does NOT automatically mean cholangiocarcinoma, but it **must** be investigated to exclude it. The approach: ERCP with **brush cytology** ± FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). CA 19-9 is supportive but non-specific (also elevated in benign cholestasis and other GI cancers). ***Cholangiocarcinoma is characterised by slow growth, high rate of local invasion, mucin production and tendency to invade perineural sheath and spread along nerves*** [9].
</Callout>

### History-Taking Clues to Narrow the Differential

When you're working up a patient and PSC is on your differential, these history points help you narrow down [8][15]:

| History Point | What It Helps Differentiate |
|:---|:---|
| ***PMH: IBD*** | Strongly supports PSC; ***IBD is a risk factor for PSC*** [15] |
| ***PMH: Gallstones*** | Choledocholithiasis, Mirizzi syndrome |
| ***PMH: Hepatitis B carrier*** | HCC with biliary invasion, or concurrent CLD |
| **PMH: Previous biliary surgery** | Iatrogenic stricture, secondary sclerosing cholangitis |
| **PMH: Autoimmune conditions** | PBC (Sjögren's, scleroderma); PSC-AIH overlap |
| **Drug history** | Drug-induced cholestasis |
| ***SH: Smoking, alcohol*** | Alcoholic liver disease; note smoking is protective for UC [15] |
| **SH: Raw freshwater fish consumption** | ***Clonorchis sinensis*** → RPC / cholangiocarcinoma risk [12] |
| **FH: CRC** | Lynch syndrome (increased cholangiocarcinoma risk) [9] |
| **Travel / origin** | Southeast Asia → RPC; Northern Europe → PSC more common |

<Callout title="The 3-Step Approach to Cholestatic LFTs">

1. **Check AMA** → If positive, think PBC
2. **If AMA negative → MRCP** → Multifocal strictures = PSC; normal = small-duct PSC or other intrahepatic cause
3. **Check IgG4** → Elevated = consider IgG4-associated cholangitis (treatable with steroids!)

Always **exclude secondary causes** (RPC, surgical trauma, choledocholithiasis, cholangiocarcinoma) before labelling someone with "primary" sclerosing cholangitis.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Differential Diagnosis">

1. **PSC is a diagnosis of exclusion** — you must rule out secondary sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC, RPC, ischaemic, surgical, HIV cholangiopathy, stones, tumour).

2. **IgG4-associated cholangitis** is the most critical mimic to exclude because it responds to steroids. Always check serum IgG4.

3. **PBC vs PSC**: AMA positive = PBC; AMA negative + biliary strictures on MRCP = PSC. PBC affects small ducts (normal cholangiogram); PSC affects large ducts (beaded cholangiogram).

4. **RPC vs PSC** (Hong Kong context): RPC = intrahepatic pigment stones, left lobe predominance, parasitic association, no IBD link. PSC = immune-mediated, beaded bilateral strictures, UC association.

5. **Dominant stricture in PSC** must always be investigated to exclude **cholangiocarcinoma** — use ERCP with brush cytology ± FISH.

6. **Stone vs tumour**: Stone = intermittent, painful jaundice with fever. Tumour = progressive, painless jaundice with constitutional symptoms.

7. **PSC-AIH overlap** (~5–10%): suspect if transaminases markedly elevated; responds to immunosuppression — don't miss it.

8. ***Obstructive jaundice DDx by level***: Hilum (PSC, RPC, Klatskin's, HCC, Mirizzi, CA GB); Mid-CBD (CA CBD, CA pancreas head); Distal CBD (periampullary CA, choledochal cyst, chronic pancreatitis).
