# Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD) — Definition, Epidemiology, Risk Factors, Anatomy, Etiology, Pathophysiology, Classification & Clinical Features

---

## 1. Definition

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) refers to **defects in the gastrointestinal mucosa that extend through the muscularis mucosae** into the submucosa or deeper layers, occurring in areas exposed to peptic (acid-pepsin) activity [2]. The key distinction from an "erosion" is depth: an erosion is superficial and does not breach the muscularis mucosae, whereas an ulcer does — this is why ulcers bleed from submucosal vessels and can perforate.

Breaking down the name:
- **"Peptic"** → from Greek *peptikos* ("able to digest") — these ulcers arise in areas bathed by gastric acid and pepsin.
- **"Ulcer"** → from Latin *ulcus* ("a sore") — a full-thickness mucosal defect.

So the name literally means "a digestive sore" — a mucosal defect caused by acid-pepsin digestion overwhelming mucosal defence.

<Callout title="Core Concept — Ulcer vs Erosion">
An **erosion** is confined to the mucosa (does not breach muscularis mucosae) and heals without scarring. An **ulcer** penetrates through the muscularis mucosae into the submucosa — this is why ulcers can erode into arteries (e.g. gastroduodenal artery), cause significant haemorrhage, perforate, and heal with fibrotic scarring (which can cause strictures / gastric outlet obstruction).

## 2. Epidemiology

### 2.1 Global & Hong Kong Perspective

- **Lifetime prevalence**: ~5–10% of the population will develop a peptic ulcer [2].
- **Male predominance** (M:F ≈ 3:1), although the gap is narrowing with ageing populations and increased NSAID use in women [2].
- ***Duodenal ulcers (DU)*** account for ~75% of peptic ulcers; ***gastric ulcers (GU)*** ~20%; the remainder occur at other sites (oesophagus, Meckel's diverticulum, anastomotic sites) [2].
- In Hong Kong, PUD remains the **most common cause of upper GI bleeding** [1][3], largely driven by:
  - High prevalence of *H. pylori* infection (declining but still significant in older cohorts — historically > 50% seroprevalence in adults > 60 years).
  - Widespread NSAID and aspirin use in an ageing population with cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disease.
  - Stress-related mucosal disease in ICU patients.
- ***PUD is the leading cause of death among peptic ulcer complications*** — specifically haemorrhage [3].

> **High Yield**: *Peptic ulcer is the most common cause of UGIB* [1]. The four major risk factors are ***H. pylori, NSAIDs, stress, and excess gastric acid*** [1][3].

### 2.2 Trends

- Overall incidence of PUD has declined due to *H. pylori* eradication and PPI use.
- However, NSAID/aspirin-related ulcers are **increasing** relative to *H. pylori* ulcers as eradication rates rise but antiplatelet/anticoagulant use expands.
- The proportion of "idiopathic" ulcers (neither *H. pylori* nor NSAID) is rising — now ~10–20% of DU and ~5–10% of GU in some series.

## 3. Anatomy & Function

### 3.1 Gross Anatomy of the Stomach

The stomach is divided into five anatomical regions (proximal → distal):

| Region | Key Features |
|:---|:---|
| **Cardia** | Surrounds the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ); mucus-secreting glands |
| **Fundus** | Superior dome; contains many parietal (oxyntic) and chief cells |
| **Body (Corpus)** | Main acid- and pepsinogen-secreting region; parietal cells here are the target of vagotomy |
| **Antrum** | Produces **gastrin** (G cells) and contains mucous glands; also has D cells (somatostatin) |
| **Pylorus** | Sphincteric muscle controlling gastric emptying into the duodenum |

The **duodenum** is divided into four parts (D1–D4). D1 (the duodenal bulb/cap) is the ***most common site*** for duodenal ulcers because it receives the highest concentration of gastric acid exiting the pylorus before alkaline pancreatic/biliary secretions neutralise it in D2 [2].

<Callout title="Why D1?">
Acid load is maximal in D1 because pancreatic bicarbonate enters via the ampulla of Vater in D2. D1 therefore has the highest acid exposure and is where DU almost always occur. An ulcer beyond D1 (e.g. D2, jejunum) should raise suspicion for **Zollinger-Ellison syndrome** or other unusual aetiologies [2].
</Callout>

### 3.2 Arterial Supply [2]

Understanding the arterial anatomy is critical because **ulcer haemorrhage** occurs when the ulcer erodes into an artery.

**Greater curvature:**
- Short gastric arteries (from splenic artery)
- Left gastro-omental (gastroepiploic) artery (from splenic artery)
- Right gastro-omental (gastroepiploic) artery (from gastroduodenal artery)

**Lesser curvature:**
- Left gastric artery (from coeliac trunk — the largest blood supply to the stomach)
- Right gastric artery (from common hepatic artery / proper hepatic artery)

**Duodenum (D1):**
- Supplied by branches of the **gastroduodenal artery (GDA)**, which runs behind the first part of the duodenum.

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl — The GDA and Posterior DU Bleeding" type="error">
***Posterior duodenal ulcers*** classically erode into the **gastroduodenal artery (GDA)**, causing massive, life-threatening haemorrhage (coffee-ground vomiting or melena) [3]. This is the single most tested vascular anatomy fact in PUD.

***Anterior duodenal ulcers*** tend to **perforate** into the peritoneal cavity (because there is no adjacent artery to tamponade; the anterior wall faces the free peritoneal space).

**Mnemonic: "Posterior bleeds, Anterior perforates"** — or "Posterior Pours, Anterior Perforates."
</Callout>

**Gastric ulcers on the lesser curvature** can erode into the **left gastric artery** — the largest arterial supply to the stomach — causing catastrophic haemorrhage.

### 3.3 Nerve Supply [2]

**Sympathetic supply:**
- Greater splanchnic nerve (T5–T9 sympathetic trunk) → coeliac ganglion → stomach
- Function: inhibits peristalsis, constricts pyloric sphincter, reduces secretions

**Parasympathetic supply (Vagus nerve, CN X):**
- ***Anterior vagal nerve***: innervates the stomach, pylorus, and liver (gives off the hepatic branch, then continues as the anterior nerve of Latarjet along the lesser curvature) [2]
- ***Posterior vagal nerve***: innervates the stomach and the entire foregut/midgut down to the splenic flexure (gives off the coeliac branch, then continues as the posterior nerve of Latarjet) [2]

The **nerve of Latarjet** (anterior and posterior) runs along the lesser curvature and provides the principal motor and secretory innervation to the antrum and pylorus. It is the key structure in **highly selective vagotomy** (HSV), where only the parietal cell branches are divided while preserving the nerve of Latarjet to maintain antral motility and pyloric function [3].

> **High Yield for surgery**: In **truncal vagotomy**, both vagal trunks are divided at the oesophageal hiatus. This abolishes the pyloric relaxation reflex → must add a **drainage procedure** (pyloroplasty or gastrojejunostomy). In **highly selective vagotomy**, the nerve of Latarjet is preserved so pyloric function is maintained and no drainage is needed — but the operation is technically difficult [3].

### 3.4 Gastric Mucosal Physiology — Offence vs Defence

Understanding PUD requires understanding the balance between aggressive and protective factors:

**Aggressive factors ("Offence"):**
1. **Hydrochloric acid (HCl)** — secreted by parietal cells, stimulated by:
   - **Gastrin** (from G cells in antrum) — endocrine pathway
   - **Histamine** (from enterochromaffin-like [ECL] cells in corpus) — paracrine pathway via H₂ receptors
   - **Acetylcholine** (from vagal nerve endings) — neural pathway via M₃ receptors
2. **Pepsin** — secreted as inactive pepsinogen by chief cells; activated by acid (pH < 2); digests proteins including mucosal tissue
3. **Bile acids** — refluxed bile can disrupt the mucosal barrier (relevant in post-gastrectomy states)

**Defensive factors ("Defence"):**
1. **Mucus-bicarbonate barrier** — surface mucous cells secrete a thick gel layer of mucus + bicarbonate ions, creating a pH gradient from ~2 in the lumen to ~7 at the epithelial surface
2. **Prostaglandins (especially PGE₂ and PGI₂)** — produced via COX-1 in mucosal epithelial cells; prostaglandins:
   - Stimulate mucus and bicarbonate secretion
   - Maintain mucosal blood flow (vasodilation)
   - Promote epithelial cell turnover and repair
   - Inhibit gastric acid secretion
3. **Mucosal blood flow** — washes away back-diffused H⁺ ions and delivers oxygen/nutrients for repair
4. **Epithelial cell turnover** — the gastric epithelium renews every 3–5 days; rapid restitution after injury
5. **Surface phospholipids** — create a hydrophobic layer that repels acid

**PUD occurs when aggressive factors overwhelm defensive factors.**

<Callout title="The Ulcer Equation">
**PUD = ↑ Aggression (acid, pepsin, bile, H. pylori, NSAIDs) + ↓ Defence (mucus, bicarbonate, blood flow, prostaglandins, epithelial repair)**

No acid, no ulcer — Karl Schwarz's dictum (1910). While this is an oversimplification (most DU patients have normal acid levels), acid is a necessary cofactor for virtually all peptic ulcers.
</Callout>

## 4. Etiology & Pathophysiology

### 4.1 *Helicobacter pylori* Infection [2][3]

***H. pylori*** is the single most important aetiological factor worldwide.

**Microbiology:**
- **Microaerophilic, Gram-negative, curved/spiral-shaped rod (coccobacillus)**
- Possesses **flagella** → motility through the viscous mucus layer
- Produces **mucolytic enzymes** → facilitates penetration to the epithelial surface
- Has **strong urease activity** → this is vital for survival and colonisation:
  - Bacterial urease **hydrolyses gastric luminal urea → ammonia (NH₃) + CO₂**
  - Ammonia neutralises surrounding gastric acid, creating a **protective alkaline cloud** around the organism
  - This is the basis for the **rapid urease test (CLO test)** and the **urea breath test (UBT)** used diagnostically [2]

**Pathogenesis of DU vs GU — the two patterns of *H. pylori* gastritis:**

| Feature | Antral-predominant gastritis → **Duodenal ulcer** | Pangastritis (antrum + body) → **Gastric ulcer** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Inflammation pattern | Confined to antrum; body (corpus) is spared | Involves both antrum and body |
| Effect on acid | ↑ Acid secretion (body parietal cells are intact and uninhibited; antral inflammation ↑ gastrin release and ↓ somatostatin) | ↓ Acid secretion (parietal cell destruction/atrophy in the body → hypochlorhydria) |
| Mechanism of ulcer | Excess acid overwhelms duodenal defences → DU | Mucosal defence is impaired by widespread inflammation despite lower acid → GU |
| Gastric cancer risk | **Low** (no atrophy, no metaplasia) | **High** (atrophy → intestinal metaplasia → dysplasia → carcinoma sequence) [2][4] |

Why does antral-predominant gastritis increase acid?
- *H. pylori* infection of antral G cells → ↑ gastrin release
- *H. pylori* infection of antral D cells → ↓ somatostatin (the "brake" on acid secretion is lost)
- Net effect: hypergastrinaemia → parietal cell hyperplasia in the (unaffected) body → acid hypersecretion

Why does pangastritis decrease acid?
- Inflammation extends to the body → direct damage to parietal cells → atrophic gastritis → loss of acid-secreting capacity
- Compensatory ↑ gastrin occurs but there are fewer functioning parietal cells to respond

**Virulence factors of *H. pylori*:**
- **CagA** (cytotoxin-associated gene A) — injected into host cells via a type IV secretion system; disrupts cell signalling, promotes inflammation, and is strongly associated with ulcers and gastric cancer
- **VacA** (vacuolating cytotoxin A) — induces vacuolation and apoptosis in epithelial cells
- **Urease** — as above, neutralises acid
- **Flagella and adhesins (e.g., BabA, SabA)** — enable colonisation

> **High Yield**: ***H. pylori* is found in ~90–95% of DU and ~60–80% of GU** [2]. Eradication of *H. pylori* dramatically reduces ulcer recurrence from ~80% to < 5% per year.

### 4.2 NSAIDs (Including Aspirin) [2][3]

NSAIDs are the **second most common** cause of PUD.

**Pathogenesis:**
1. **Systemic prostaglandin inhibition (the main mechanism):**
   - Gastric and duodenal mucosa rely on **COX-1** (constitutive) for the synthesis of prostaglandins (especially PGE₂ and PGI₂)
   - Prostaglandins protect the mucosa by: mucin production, bicarbonate secretion, maintaining mucosal blood flow, inhibiting acid secretion, and promoting epithelial cell turnover
   - **Non-selective NSAIDs inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2** → impaired prostaglandin production → disruption of mucosal barrier → increased mucosal permeability to H⁺ ions → intramural acidosis → cell death → ulceration [2]
   - This is a **systemic** effect — even parenteral or rectal NSAIDs cause gastric ulcers (not just direct topical injury)

2. **Topical injury (minor contribution):**
   - Many NSAIDs are weak acids that are non-ionised in the acidic gastric lumen → they diffuse into mucosal cells where the neutral intracellular pH causes them to ionise and become trapped ("ion trapping") → direct cellular toxicity

3. **Impaired platelet function:**
   - COX-1 inhibition in platelets → ↓ thromboxane A₂ → impaired platelet aggregation → if an ulcer forms, bleeding is more severe and harder to stop

**Why selective COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib, etoricoxib) are safer:**
- COX-2 is mainly induced in inflammatory cells and is not the dominant isoform in gastric mucosa
- Selective COX-2 inhibition spares COX-1-dependent prostaglandin production in the stomach
- However, COX-2 inhibitors still carry some GI risk (COX-2 contributes to mucosal healing) and importantly increase cardiovascular risk (↓ PGI₂ in endothelium while TXA₂ production is preserved)

**Risk factors for NSAID-related peptic ulcers** [2]:
- ***Advanced age ( > 75 years)***
- ***Prior history of clinical ulcer disease or ulcer complications***
- ***High dose / long duration / relatively toxic NSAIDs***
- ***Concurrent use of corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents***
- Concomitant *H. pylori* infection (synergistic risk)
- Concurrent use of SSRIs (impair platelet serotonin uptake → worse bleeding)

<Callout title="NSAIDs + H. pylori — Synergistic Risk" type="error">
The combination of NSAIDs and *H. pylori* infection has a **synergistic** (not just additive) effect on ulcer risk. Current guidelines recommend testing and eradicating *H. pylori* before initiating long-term NSAID therapy, especially in high-risk patients.
</Callout>

### 4.3 Stress-Related Mucosal Disease (SRMD)

**"Stress ulcers"** occur in critically ill patients (burns, trauma, major surgery, sepsis, ICU patients on mechanical ventilation). This is **physiological stress**, not psychological stress.

**Pathogenesis:**
- Splanchnic hypoperfusion → mucosal ischaemia → breakdown of mucosal defence
- ↓ Mucosal blood flow → ↓ bicarbonate delivery → ↓ wash-out of back-diffused H⁺
- Reperfusion injury with free radical generation worsens mucosal damage

**Eponymous types:**
- **Curling ulcer** — associated with severe **burns** (named after Thomas Blizard Curling). Mechanism: hypovolaemia → splanchnic vasoconstriction → mucosal ischaemia. Typically in the duodenum.
- **Cushing ulcer** — associated with **CNS injury/neurosurgery** (named after Harvey Cushing). Mechanism: ↑ vagal tone from raised ICP → ↑ gastric acid secretion. Unique in that these ulcers have **high acid** as a driver. Typically deep, single ulcers that perforate.

### 4.4 Smoking

- Impairs mucosal blood flow (nicotine → vasoconstriction)
- Reduces bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas and duodenal mucosa
- Promotes duodenogastric reflux of bile
- May enhance *H. pylori* colonisation
- Delays ulcer healing and increases recurrence

### 4.5 Alcohol

- Direct topical mucosal irritant → disrupts the mucosal barrier
- Stimulates acid secretion (especially at low concentrations)
- Causes acute gastritis (mucosal haemorrhage) rather than true chronic PUD per se, but exacerbates ulcers

### 4.6 Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES) [2]

**A rare but important cause of refractory/unusual ulcers.**

- Caused by a **gastrinoma** (gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumour) — most commonly in the **duodenum (60–80%)** or **pancreas (20–40%)**, in the "gastrinoma triangle"
- **Pathophysiology:** Autonomous hypersecretion of gastrin → massive acid hypersecretion → overwhelms mucosal defences → multiple, refractory ulcers
- ↑ Gastrin also causes **gastric epithelial cell (ECL cell and parietal cell) hyperplasia**

**When to suspect ZES** [2]:
- ***Recurrent ulcers despite adequate treatment***
- ***Ulcers in unusual locations (D2, jejunum)***
- ***Complicated PUD without H. pylori or NSAID use***
- Multiple ulcers simultaneously
- Ulcers associated with diarrhoea (massive acid inactivates pancreatic lipase → steatorrhoea; acid damages small bowel mucosa)
- Association with **MEN1** (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1) — parathyroid adenoma + pituitary adenoma + pancreatic/duodenal neuroendocrine tumour

**Diagnosis:** Fasting serum gastrin level (markedly elevated, typically > 1000 pg/mL) **in the presence of high gastric acid output** (to distinguish from the hypergastrinaemia of achlorhydria/PPI use, where gastrin rises as a compensatory response to low acid) [2].

### 4.7 Other / Rarer Causes

- **Corticosteroids** — alone they have minimal ulcerogenic potential, but in combination with NSAIDs they significantly increase risk
- **Crack cocaine, methamphetamines** — mesenteric vasoconstriction → mucosal ischaemia
- **Radiation** — to upper abdomen
- **Crohn's disease** — can cause duodenal or gastric ulcers
- **CMV/HSV** — in immunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV/AIDS, post-transplant)
- **Gastric cancer** — a gastric ulcer may be malignant (always biopsy GU; DU is almost never malignant)
- **Idiopathic ulcers** — rising proportion; possibly related to mucosal hypersensitivity, visceral hyperalgesia, or unidentified pathogens

## 5. Classification

### 5.1 By Location

| Site | Frequency | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Duodenal ulcer (DU)** | ~75% | Almost always in D1 (duodenal bulb); >95% benign |
| **Gastric ulcer (GU)** | ~20% | Lesser curvature and antrum most common; must biopsy to exclude malignancy |
| **Other** | ~5% | Oesophagus (Barrett's), Meckel's diverticulum (ectopic gastric mucosa), surgical anastomoses (marginal/stomal ulcers) |

### 5.2 Modified Johnson Classification of Gastric Ulcers [2][3]

This classification is based on **anatomical location and acid-secretory status** and is particularly useful for guiding **surgical management** of GU.

| Type | Location | Acid Secretion | Surgical Approach [3] |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Type I*** (most common, ~58%) | Body of stomach / lesser curvature near the **angular incisure (incisura angularis)** | Normal or ↓ | Distal gastrectomy + Billroth I/II |
| ***Type II*** (~22%) | Body of stomach (GU) + simultaneous **duodenal ulcer** | ↑↑ | Truncal vagotomy + antrectomy + Billroth II |
| ***Type III*** (~20%) | **Prepyloric** (within 3 cm of pylorus) | ↑↑ | Truncal vagotomy + antrectomy + Billroth II |
| ***Type IV*** (rare) | High on the lesser curvature near the **GOJ** | ↓↓ | Subtotal gastrectomy extending to include the ulcer + Billroth I/II/Roux-en-Y |
| ***Type V*** | Any location — **medication-induced** (NSAIDs) | Variable (usually normal) | Treat medically; surgery rarely needed |

<Callout title="Why Does This Classification Matter?">
Types II and III are **acid-hypersecretory** states (behave more like DU) → surgery must include an **acid-reducing procedure** (vagotomy). Types I and IV are **not** acid-hypersecretory → surgery focuses on resecting the ulcer (to exclude malignancy and remove the diseased mucosa) rather than reducing acid [3].
</Callout>

### 5.3 Forrest Classification (for bleeding ulcers — will be detailed in UGIB management)

This endoscopic classification grades the stigmata of recent haemorrhage (SRH) and predicts rebleeding risk — critical for guiding endoscopic therapy. Briefly:

| Forrest Class | Description | Rebleeding Risk |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Ia | Spurting haemorrhage | ~90% |
| Ib | Oozing haemorrhage | ~50% |
| IIa | Non-bleeding visible vessel (NBVV) | ~40–50% |
| IIb | Adherent clot | ~20–30% |
| IIc | Flat pigmented spot | ~5–10% |
| III | Clean base ulcer | < 5% |

## 6. Clinical Features

### 6.1 Symptoms

**A. Epigastric Pain** — the cardinal symptom [2]

- **Character**: Gnawing, burning, or aching pain localised to the epigastrium.
- **Pathophysiological basis**: Exposed submucosal nerve endings in the ulcer crater are stimulated by gastric acid and pepsin contact; also local inflammation with release of inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, bradykinin, substance P) activating visceral nociceptors.
- The **relationship of pain to meals** differs classically between DU and GU:

| Feature | Duodenal Ulcer | Gastric Ulcer |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Pain timing** | 2–5 hours after meals ("hunger pain"); relieved by eating or antacids | Within 30 min of eating; exacerbated by food |
| **Night pain** | Common (acid secretion peaks at ~2 AM via vagal drive during sleep) | Less common |
| **Mechanism** | Food buffers acid → pain relief; when stomach empties, unbuffered acid washes into D1 → pain returns | Food stimulates acid secretion and gastric distension → irritates ulcer |
| **Weight** | May gain weight (eating relieves pain) | May lose weight (eating worsens pain → food avoidance) |

- **Periodicity**: PUD pain classically waxes and wanes over weeks to months, with symptom-free intervals. This reflects cycles of ulcer healing and relapse.
- **Radiation to the back**: Atypical but important — suggests **posterior penetration** (DU penetrating into the pancreas; GU penetrating into the pancreatic body). Persistent back pain in PUD is a red flag [2].

<Callout title="Meal-Pain Relationship — Why?" type="idea">
In DU: food enters the stomach → acid is buffered → pain relief. But 2–5 hours later, the stomach empties and a bolus of unbuffered acid enters D1 → pain returns. This is why DU causes "hunger pain" and night pain (the stomach is empty, acid is unbuffered, vagal drive peaks overnight).

In GU: food → gastrin release → ↑ acid secretion + gastric distension → direct irritation of the ulcer in the stomach wall → pain with meals.
</Callout>

**B. Nausea and Vomiting**
- More common in GU than DU.
- Pathophysiology: gastric mucosal inflammation → visceral afferent stimulation → nausea; if there is pyloric oedema or spasm from a peri-pyloric ulcer, gastric emptying is delayed → vomiting.
- **Projectile, non-bilious vomiting of undigested food** → suggests ***gastric outlet obstruction (GOO)*** due to chronic scarring/fibrosis at the pylorus [3].

**C. Early Satiety and Postprandial Fullness**
- Due to gastric inflammation, impaired accommodation (fundus fails to relax normally), or pyloric oedema causing delayed emptying.

**D. Belching and Bloating**
- Aerophagia from repeated swallowing (a reflex response to nausea/pain); also gaseous distension from delayed emptying.

**E. Anorexia and Weight Loss**
- More common with GU (food avoidance due to pain).
- Must always exclude gastric malignancy in a patient with GU + weight loss.

**F. Fatty Food Intolerance**
- Fat delays gastric emptying and stimulates cholecystokinin (CCK) → may exacerbate symptoms.

**G. Heartburn (Not a Primary Symptom of PUD)**
- Heartburn (retrosternal burning) is more suggestive of GERD but may coexist — the two conditions share risk factors [2].

**H. Symptoms of Complications** (presenting features in some patients):
- **Haematemesis / melaena** → haemorrhage (the most common complication presenting acutely)
- **Sudden severe epigastric pain ("thunderclap") radiating to the whole abdomen** → perforation
- **Persistent vomiting of old food, succussion splash** → gastric outlet obstruction

> **High Yield**: Up to **70% of NSAID-related ulcers are asymptomatic** — the first presentation may be a life-threatening haemorrhage or perforation. This is because NSAIDs also have analgesic properties that mask ulcer pain [2].

<Callout title="Silent Ulcers" type="error">
Do NOT assume a patient without epigastric pain does not have PUD. Elderly patients and those on NSAIDs frequently present with a complication (bleeding, perforation) as the first manifestation — the so-called **"silent ulcer."** Always consider PUD in elderly patients with unexplained anaemia or melaena even without pain.
</Callout>

### 6.2 Signs

**A. General Examination — Often Normal in Uncomplicated PUD**

In uncomplicated PUD, physical examination may be entirely unremarkable. This is important to recognise: **the diagnosis of uncomplicated PUD is clinical (history) + endoscopic, not based on physical signs.**

**B. Epigastric Tenderness**
- **Mild, localised epigastric tenderness** on palpation — the most common (but non-specific) sign.
- Pathophysiology: visceral inflammation in the upper GI tract → referred somatic pain/tenderness in the T6–T8 dermatome distribution (epigastrium).
- Absence of tenderness does NOT exclude PUD; its presence does not confirm it.

**C. Signs of Complications:**

| Complication | Signs | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Haemorrhage** | Pallor, tachycardia, hypotension, postural drop, melaena on PR exam, haematemesis or coffee-ground aspirate on NG tube | Ulcer erodes into submucosal or serosal artery (e.g. GDA in posterior DU) → blood loss → hypovolaemic shock |
| **Perforation** | ***Board-like rigidity***, guarding, rebound tenderness, absent bowel sounds, loss of liver dullness on percussion (Jobert sign — pneumoperitoneum), fever, tachycardia, shock | Free perforation → gastric/duodenal contents spill into peritoneal cavity → chemical then bacterial peritonitis → peritoneal irritation → reflex muscle spasm (rigidity) |
| **Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO)** | ***Succussion splash*** (audible splash on shaking the abdomen > 4 hours after last meal), visible gastric peristalsis, distended upper abdomen, dehydration, ***hypochloraemic hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis*** | Chronic scarring at pylorus/D1 → mechanical obstruction → gastric dilation → repeated vomiting of HCl-rich gastric juice → loss of H⁺ and Cl⁻ → the kidneys compensate by retaining H⁺ and excreting K⁺ and HCO₃⁻, but the loss of Cl⁻ limits the kidney's ability to excrete HCO₃⁻ → alkalosis perpetuates [3] |
| **Penetration** | Persistent back pain (no longer relieved by food/antacids), signs of pancreatitis (if penetrating into pancreas) | Ulcer erodes posteriorly through the full thickness of the wall into an adjacent organ (pancreas, lesser omentum, liver) without free perforation (because the adjacent organ "seals" the hole) |

<Callout title="GOO Metabolic Derangement — Step by Step" type="idea">
1. Vomiting loses **HCl** (H⁺ + Cl⁻) → metabolic alkalosis + hypochloraemia.
2. Volume depletion → kidney activates RAAS → aldosterone → Na⁺ reabsorption in exchange for K⁺ and H⁺ secretion → **hypokalaemia** and paradoxical aciduria ("paradoxical" because the body is alkalotic but the kidneys are excreting acid to retain Na⁺).
3. Loss of Cl⁻ means the kidney cannot excrete HCO₃⁻ (because Cl⁻ is needed in exchange for HCO₃⁻ reabsorption in the proximal tubule) → alkalosis is maintained = "chloride-responsive alkalosis."
4. Treatment: **IV normal saline (0.9% NaCl)** repletes volume and chloride → kidneys can now excrete excess HCO₃⁻ → alkalosis corrects. Add KCl for hypokalaemia.
</Callout>

**D. Signs Suggesting Alternative Diagnoses (Important Negatives):**
- Jaundice → think biliary disease, pancreatic head malignancy, hepatocellular disease
- Lymphadenopathy (Virchow's node — left supraclavicular) → gastric malignancy
- Palpable mass → gastric cancer, not uncomplicated PUD
- Hepatomegaly / ascites → consider liver disease with portal hypertensive gastropathy or variceal bleeding mimicking PUD

---

## 7. Important Alarm Features ("Red Flags") in Dyspepsia [2]

These features warrant **urgent upper endoscopy (OGD)** to exclude malignancy:

- **Age ≥ 55** with new-onset dyspepsia
- Family history of upper GI cancer
- Unintended weight loss
- GI bleeding (haematemesis, melaena, iron-deficiency anaemia)
- Progressive dysphagia or odynophagia
- Persistent vomiting
- Jaundice
- Palpable mass or lymphadenopathy

## 8. Key Distinguishing Features: DU vs GU

| Feature | Duodenal Ulcer | Gastric Ulcer |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Location | D1 (bulb) | Lesser curvature, antrum |
| H. pylori association | ~90–95% | ~60–80% |
| Acid secretion | ↑ or normal | Normal or ↓ |
| Gastritis pattern | Antral-predominant | Pangastritis |
| Pain relation to food | Relieved by food; "hunger pain," night pain | Worsened by food |
| Weight | May gain | May lose |
| Malignancy risk | Essentially zero | ~5% of GU may be malignant → **always biopsy** |
| Cancer sequence | Not associated with gastric cancer | Atrophy → intestinal metaplasia → dysplasia → carcinoma |
| Perforation | Anterior wall → free peritoneum | Can also perforate (lesser sac) |
| Haemorrhage | Posterior wall → GDA | Lesser curvature → left gastric artery |

<Callout title="Always Biopsy Gastric Ulcers" type="error">
Duodenal ulcers are almost never malignant and do not routinely need biopsy. **Gastric ulcers MUST be biopsied** (multiple biopsies from the ulcer rim) to exclude gastric adenocarcinoma or lymphoma. A non-healing GU after > 3 months of treatment requires repeat OGD + biopsy and strong consideration for surgical excision [3].
</Callout>

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">
1. **PUD = mucosal defect through the muscularis mucosae** — "no acid, no ulcer" but the balance of aggression vs defence is the true paradigm.
2. **DU (~75%) > GU (~20%)**; DU almost always in D1; GU on lesser curvature/antrum.
3. **Two dominant causes: *H. pylori* (90–95% DU, 60–80% GU) and NSAIDs** — these are synergistic.
4. **NSAIDs cause ulcers systemically** by inhibiting COX-1 → ↓ prostaglandins → ↓ mucus, bicarbonate, blood flow.
5. **Modified Johnson classification** (Types I–V) classifies GU by location and acid status → guides surgical approach.
6. **"Posterior bleeds, Anterior perforates"** — posterior DU erodes into GDA; anterior DU perforates freely.
7. **DU pain**: hunger pain, relieved by food, nocturnal. **GU pain**: worse with food.
8. **Up to 70% of NSAID ulcers are silent** — first presentation may be haemorrhage or perforation.
9. **Always biopsy GU** to exclude malignancy; DU biopsy is not routine.
10. **GOO** → non-bilious projectile vomiting, succussion splash, hypochloraemic hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis.
11. **ZES**: suspect if recurrent/refractory ulcers, unusual location (D2/jejunum), no H. pylori/NSAIDs.
12. ***PUD is the most common cause of UGIB*** [1].

      question: "What is the fundamental pathological difference between a gastric erosion and a peptic ulcer?",
      markscheme: "An erosion is confined to the mucosa and does not breach the muscularis mucosae. A peptic ulcer penetrates through the muscularis mucosae into the submucosa or deeper, which is why ulcers can cause significant haemorrhage, perforation, and heal with fibrotic scarring."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain why posterior duodenal ulcers bleed while anterior duodenal ulcers perforate.",
      markscheme: "Posterior DU erode into the gastroduodenal artery (GDA) which runs behind D1, causing massive haemorrhage. Anterior DU face the free peritoneal cavity with no adjacent major vessel to tamponade the defect, so they perforate into the peritoneum instead."
    },
    {
      question: "Describe the pathogenesis of NSAID-induced peptic ulcers. Why do COX-2 selective inhibitors have a lower GI risk?",
      markscheme: "Non-selective NSAIDs inhibit COX-1 in gastric mucosa, reducing prostaglandin synthesis (PGE2, PGI2). Prostaglandins maintain mucosal defence by stimulating mucus and bicarbonate secretion, maintaining mucosal blood flow, and promoting epithelial repair. Loss of these protective effects leads to mucosal barrier breakdown and ulceration. COX-2 selective inhibitors spare COX-1, preserving prostaglandin-mediated gastroprotection."
    },
    {
      question: "A patient presents with recurrent peptic ulcers in the second part of the duodenum despite H. pylori eradication and no NSAID use. What diagnosis should you suspect and how would you confirm it?",
      markscheme: "Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma). Confirm with fasting serum gastrin level (markedly elevated, typically greater than 1000 pg/mL) in the presence of proven high gastric acid output (to exclude hypergastrinaemia from PPI use or achlorhydria)."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain the metabolic derangement seen in gastric outlet obstruction due to chronic peptic ulcer disease.",
      markscheme: "Repeated vomiting of HCl-rich gastric juice leads to loss of H+ and Cl- causing hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis. Volume depletion activates RAAS and aldosterone, causing renal K+ and H+ excretion in exchange for Na+ reabsorption, leading to hypokalaemia and paradoxical aciduria. The chloride deficit prevents renal HCO3- excretion, perpetuating the alkalosis. This is a chloride-responsive alkalosis corrected by IV normal saline and KCl."
    },
    {
      question: "Why must all gastric ulcers be biopsied but not duodenal ulcers?",
      markscheme: "Approximately 5% of gastric ulcers may be malignant (gastric adenocarcinoma or lymphoma can present as ulcers). Duodenal ulcers are essentially never malignant. Therefore, multiple biopsies from the rim of all GU are mandatory. A non-healing GU after more than 3 months of treatment requires repeat OGD with biopsy and consideration for surgical excision."
