## Complications of Peptic Ulcer Disease

PUD is not simply "a sore that hurts." Left untreated or in the setting of ongoing risk factors, the ulcer can breach deeper layers of the bowel wall and injure surrounding structures. Every complication is best understood by asking: **which layer has the ulcer just breached, and what lies immediately beyond it?**

The five major complications, in order of clinical importance:

1. **Haemorrhage** (most common complication; ***leading cause of death*** [3])
2. **Perforation** (most dramatic acute presentation)
3. **Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO)** (chronic complication)
4. **Penetration** (contained perforation into an adjacent organ)
5. **Fistulisation** (rarest)

Additionally, there is a **sixth category** — **malignant transformation** — which applies to gastric ulcers only, and a **seventh** — **post-surgical (gastrectomy) complications** — which is crucial for exams.

### 1. Haemorrhage

#### 1.1 Pathophysiology — Why Do Ulcers Bleed?

The ulcer starts at the mucosa and erodes progressively deeper: mucosa → muscularis mucosae → submucosa → muscularis propria → serosa. The submucosa contains a rich vascular plexus. Once the ulcer breaches the muscularis mucosae and enters the submucosa, it encounters arteries and veins. If the ulcer erodes even deeper through the full wall thickness posteriorly, it can reach **named arteries** behind the bowel wall.

- ***DU bleeding usually locates at the posterior duodenal wall within 2 cm of the pylorus*** and ***typically erodes into the gastroduodenal artery (GDA)*** [2][3] — the GDA runs behind D1, so a posterior DU bores straight into it.
- **GU bleeding** on the lesser curvature can erode into the **left gastric artery** (the largest arterial supply to the stomach).
- The clinical presentation depends on the rate and volume of bleeding: slow ooze → occult blood loss → iron-deficiency anaemia; brisk bleed → haematemesis (vomiting red blood or ***coffee-ground material*** — coffee-ground appearance results from haemoglobin being denatured to haematin by gastric acid) and/or ***melaena*** (black, tarry stool — the result of haemoglobin being digested through the entire GI tract and converted to haematin and other pigments by gut bacteria).

#### 1.2 Risk Factors for Recurrent Bleeding [1]

These are testable and clinically important — they identify patients who need close monitoring or early surgical/IR referral:

> ***Risk factors for recurrent bleeding*** [1]:
> - ***Patient already hospitalised*** (stress, comorbidities, NSAIDs)
> - ***Large ulcer***
> - ***Ulcer on posterior D1*** (proximity to GDA)
> - ***Ulcer on higher posterior lesser curve*** (proximity to left gastric artery)

Additional risk factors [2]:
- Age > 60
- Coagulopathy or anticoagulant use
- Hb < 8.0 g/dL on presentation
- Shock on presentation
- Need for blood transfusion

#### 1.3 Signs of Rebleeding [2]

After initial endoscopic haemostasis, **continuous vigilance** is required:
- ***Haematemesis*** or ***fresh melaena***
- ***Tachycardia*** (the earliest haemodynamic sign — the body compensates by increasing heart rate before blood pressure drops)
- ***Falling Hb trend*** on serial monitoring (anaemia developing despite transfusion)
- ***Blood in the NG tube*** [2]

<Callout title="Post-Endoscopic Monitoring">
***Post-endoscopic monitoring of Hb count is required to identify rebleeding*** [2]. Check Hb every 6–8 hours for the first 24–48 hours after endoscopic therapy. A drop of > 2 g/dL despite transfusion suggests rebleeding. Combine with clinical signs (tachycardia, hypotension, fresh haematemesis/melaena).
</Callout>

#### 1.4 Management — Stepped Approach

This has been covered in detail in the management section; here is a concise summary of the escalation ladder:

**Step 1: Resuscitate** → ABC, 2 large-bore IV, fluids, blood if Hb < 7 (or < 9 if high-risk)

**Step 2: Endoscopy** → ***Dual therapy*** (***adrenaline 1:10,000*** [***tamponade + vasoconstriction + platelet aggregation***] + ***heater probe*** [***coaptive effect: pressure + heat***] or ***metal clip***) for Forrest Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb [1][3]
- ***Clean base → start feeding, early discharge*** [1]
- ***Injection therapy should NOT be used as monotherapy*** [2][3]

**Step 3: Post-OGD** → ***IV PPI infusion (80 mg stat → 8 mg/h × 72h)*** — ***higher pH stabilises clot since platelet function depends on normal pH*** [3]

**Step 4: If rebleed** → Re-scope + repeat endoscopic therapy

**Step 5: If 2nd endoscopy fails** → ***Surgery or TAE*** [1][2][3]

***Surgery for bleeding ulcer — indications*** [1]:
- ***Therapeutic endoscopist not available***
- ***Massive bleeding***
- ***Failed endoscopic therapy***
- ***Rebleed after endoscopic therapy***

***Surgery = Plication of bleeder + additional procedure*** [1]:
- ***DU: V+P*** (truncal **V**agotomy + **P**yloroplasty) [1]
- ***GU: partial gastrectomy*** [1] (because GU may harbour malignancy)

***TAE*** (transcatheter arterial embolisation): equally effective as surgery for patients who failed endoscopic therapy; fewer complications; should be considered in patients unfit for surgery [2][3]

***Limitations of endoscopic haemostasis*** [3]:
- ***Massive bleeding obscuring view***
- ***Large bleeding artery ( > 3.2 mm)***
- ***Large ulcer ( > 2 cm)***

---

### 2. Perforation

#### 2.1 Pathophysiology

When the ulcer erodes through **all layers of the bowel wall** (mucosa → submucosa → muscularis propria → serosa) and there is **no adjacent organ to seal the defect**, the luminal contents spill freely into the peritoneal cavity. This causes:

1. **Chemical peritonitis** (first 4–6 hours) — gastric acid (pH ~1–2), pepsin, bile, and food particles directly irritate the peritoneum. This produces the classic **sudden, severe, "thunderclap" epigastric pain** and ***board-like rigidity*** (reflex tonic contraction of the abdominal wall muscles to splint the inflamed peritoneum).

2. **Bacterial peritonitis** (after 6 hours) — gut flora colonise the contaminated peritoneal fluid → systemic inflammatory response → sepsis → multi-organ failure if untreated [3].

***Most common site: anterior wall of D1*** [3] — because the anterior wall faces the free peritoneal cavity with nothing to tamponade or seal the defect (contrast with the posterior wall which is retroperitoneal and abutted by the pancreas).

#### 2.2 Clinical Features [3]

- ***Sudden onset severe generalised abdominal pain*** — the patient can often ***pinpoint the exact onset time*** (unlike gradual-onset pain of pancreatitis or cholecystitis) [3]
- ***Board-like rigidity*** with patient lying completely still (any movement worsens peritoneal irritation)
- ***+/- RLQ pain (Valentino's sign)***: GI contents track down the **right paracolic gutter** to the RIF, mimicking appendicitis [3]
- Progression: ***Shock → fever*** — chemical peritonitis in first 4–6 hours → bacterial peritonitis after 6 hours [3]
- Loss of liver dullness on percussion (Jobert sign) — free gas between the liver and abdominal wall

#### 2.3 Investigations [3]

- ***Erect CXR***: ***free gas under diaphragm in 60–70% of cases*** (require sitting upright for ≥ 10 minutes before film) [3]
- ***CT thorax + abdomen with contrast***: rule out other DDx; detect small amounts of free gas and fluid that CXR may miss
- Bloods: ***CBC (Hb for GIB, WCC), LRFT, T&S, clotting, amylase*** (↑ due to pancreatic irritation by leaked duodenal contents — but typically a mild elevation; if markedly elevated, suspect acute pancreatitis as the primary diagnosis instead) [3]
- ***Do NOT attempt OGD: may convert sealed-off perforation to real perforation*** [3]

<Callout title="Why NOT Do OGD in Suspected Perforation?" type="error">
Gas insufflation during endoscopy increases intraluminal pressure. If a perforation has been partially sealed by omentum or fibrin, the pressure blows the seal open → converts a contained leak into a **free perforation** with flooding peritonitis. This is a well-known iatrogenic disaster. If peritonism and pneumoperitoneum are present, go to the operating theatre, not the endoscopy suite [3].
</Callout>

#### 2.4 Management [3]

**Resuscitation:**
- NPO, IV fluids, NG tube decompression
- ***IV broad-spectrum antibiotics*** (e.g., Augmentin) — to cover emerging bacterial peritonitis
- ***IV PPI / H₂ blocker*** — suppress acid production, limit ongoing chemical peritonitis

**Surgery** [3]:

| Ulcer Size | Surgical Approach |
|:---|:---|
| ***Small DU/GU ( < 2 cm)*** | ***Laparoscopic or open (Graham) omental patch repair*** + ***peritoneal lavage ( > 6L NS)*** |
| ***Large DU*** | ***Distal gastrectomy + Billroth II reconstruction*** +/- controlled duodenostomy |
| ***Large GU*** | ***Wedge excision / partial gastrectomy + Billroth II reconstruction*** |

- ***Biopsy ulcer edge for ALL gastric ulcers to rule out malignancy*** [3]
- ***H. pylori eradication*** should be included in the treatment plan [3]

**Convert to open if** [3]:
- ***Haemodynamically unstable*** (shorter operative time)
- ***Large defect ( > 1 cm)*** (difficult laparoscopic suture)
- ***Gross contamination*** (limited laparoscopic peritoneal lavage)

**Post-op management** [3]:
- NPO until no signs of leakage and return of bowel function
- Complete full course of antibiotics
- Continue PPI until OGD
- ***FU OGD 6–8 weeks after surgery*** for healing + *H. pylori* status [3]

**Prognosis — Boey's Score** (3 points) [3]:

| Risk Factor | Points |
|:---|:---|
| Time from perforation to admission > 24 hours | 1 |
| Pre-op SBP < 100 mmHg | 1 |
| ≥ 1 systemic illness (heart disease, liver disease, renal disease, DM) | 1 |

| Score | Mortality |
|:---|:---|
| 0 | 0% |
| 1 | 10% |
| 2 | 45.5% |
| 3 | 100% |

### 3. Gastric Outlet Obstruction (GOO)

#### 3.1 Pathophysiology [2]

GOO from PUD occurs through three mechanisms working in sequence:

1. **Acute oedema and spasm** — active ulceration at or near the pylorus/D1 causes inflammatory swelling and smooth muscle spasm → functional narrowing. This component is **potentially reversible** with acid suppression and anti-inflammatory treatment.

2. **Chronic fibrosis and scarring** — repeated cycles of ulceration and healing deposit collagen in the pyloric/duodenal wall → fixed structural narrowing. This is **irreversible** and requires mechanical intervention (dilatation or surgery).

3. **Gastric atony** — prolonged obstruction leads to chronic gastric distension → the gastric wall muscle becomes over-stretched and loses contractile ability → even after the obstruction is relieved, the stomach may not empty properly [2].

#### 3.2 Clinical Features [2][3]

- **Waxing-and-waning epigastric pain** (pain worsens after eating as the obstructed stomach distends, then partially subsides as some content trickles through)
- ***Repeated non-bilious projectile vomiting of undigested food*** — "non-bilious" because the obstruction is **proximal to the ampulla of Vater** (bile enters in D2, but the obstruction is at the pylorus/D1). "Undigested" because the food never reaches the small bowel for digestion. "Projectile" because the stomach builds up high pressure behind the obstruction [3]
- **Early satiety, weight loss** — the patient cannot eat without vomiting
- **Succussion splash** — audible splash heard with a stethoscope when shaking the patient's abdomen > 4 hours after the last meal; indicates retained gastric fluid. Pathophysiology: the dilated, atonic stomach retains food and fluid like a water balloon, and shaking it produces the characteristic sloshing [2]

#### 3.3 Metabolic Derangement [2][3]

This is a high-yield exam topic — the electrolyte disturbance in GOO is **pathognomonic**:

***Hypochloraemic hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis +/- paradoxical aciduria*** [2][3]

**Step-by-step mechanism:**
1. **Repeated vomiting of HCl** → loss of H⁺ and Cl⁻ → **metabolic alkalosis** + **hypochloraemia**
2. **Volume depletion** → kidney activates RAAS → **aldosterone** → proximal tubule Na⁺ reabsorption in exchange for K⁺ and H⁺ secretion → **hypokalaemia** + **paradoxical aciduria** (the kidneys excrete acid despite the body being alkalotic, because Na⁺ salvage takes priority over acid-base balance)
3. **Cl⁻ deficit** prevents the kidney from excreting HCO₃⁻ (because Cl⁻ is needed for HCO₃⁻ exchange in the proximal tubule) → alkalosis is **maintained** = "chloride-responsive alkalosis"
4. **Hypokalaemia** itself worsens alkalosis: in the distal tubule, K⁺ depletion causes H⁺ to be secreted instead of K⁺, further contributing to paradoxical aciduria and perpetuating alkalosis
5. **Hypocalcaemia** may develop → tetany (alkalosis increases protein-binding of ionised Ca²⁺, reducing the free fraction) [3]

**Correction**: ***IV normal saline (0.9% NaCl) + KCl*** — NS provides both volume and chloride, allowing the kidneys to finally excrete excess bicarbonate. KCl corrects hypokalaemia and enables H⁺/K⁺ exchange to normalise [2].

<Callout title="Why Normal Saline Specifically?">
You MUST give NaCl, not dextrose or lactated Ringer's. The root problem is **chloride depletion** — without adequate chloride delivery to the kidney, the proximal tubule avidly reabsorbs all filtered HCO₃⁻ (because HCO₃⁻ reabsorption is coupled to Cl⁻). Only by replenishing Cl⁻ can the kidney "let go" of HCO₃⁻ and correct the alkalosis. This is why it's called a **chloride-responsive** metabolic alkalosis.
</Callout>

#### 3.4 Management [2][3]

**Step 1: Medical ("Drip and suck")**
- ***NPO***, ***NG tube decompression***, ***IV fluid resuscitation***
- ***Correction of electrolytes*** — NS + KCl [2]
- ***IV PPI*** (e.g., ***pantoprazole***) — reduces acid secretion, may reduce acute inflammatory oedema component [2]

**Step 2: OGD after decompression**
- Biopsy to **exclude malignancy** — ***GOO is malignant until proven otherwise*** (80% malignant, 20% benign) [3]

**Step 3: Definitive treatment**
- **Benign**: ***Endoscopic balloon dilatation*** [2] +/- stenting; if fails → surgery
- **Malignant**: treat underlying CA; palliative bypass (gastrojejunostomy) or SEMS [3]

**Surgical options for benign GOO** [2]:
- ***GU***: Antrectomy with Billroth I/II reconstruction
- ***DU***: Truncal vagotomy + Antrectomy with Billroth I/II reconstruction

---

### 4. Penetration

#### 4.1 Pathophysiology [2]

Penetration is essentially a **"sealed perforation"** — the ulcer erodes through the full thickness of the bowel wall, but instead of spilling into the free peritoneal cavity, the **adjacent organ acts as a plug**, preventing free leakage. The ulcer crater extends into the parenchyma of the neighbouring organ.

**Order of frequency of penetration** [2]:
***Pancreas > Lesser omentum > Biliary tract > Liver > Greater omentum > Mesocolon > Colon > Vascular structures***

Why is the pancreas most common? Because posterior DU sit directly against the head of the pancreas (the pancreatic head is immediately retroperitoneal to D1). As the ulcer bores posteriorly, the first structure it encounters is the pancreas.

#### 4.2 Clinical Features [2]

- Pain becomes ***more intense, longer duration***
- ***Shift from typical vague visceral discomfort to localised intense pain radiating to the back*** — this back radiation occurs because the pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ, and inflammation of retroperitoneal structures causes somatic pain referred to the back (T10–L1 dermatomes)
- Pain is ***NOT relieved by food or antacids*** — unlike uncomplicated DU, where food buffers acid and provides temporary relief, in penetration the inflammatory process in the adjacent organ is ongoing and unrelated to intraluminal acid levels [2]
- Secondary complications: **pancreatitis** (most common — from DU penetrating into pancreas), **cholangitis** (if penetrating into biliary tract) [2]

#### 4.3 Management [2]

- ***Surgical treatment is NOT recommended*** [2]
- **Conservative management**: IV PPI (high-dose acid suppression to halt further ulcer progression), *H. pylori* eradication if positive, treat the secondary complication (e.g., manage pancreatitis per standard protocol)
- Surgery reserved only for: uncontrollable haemorrhage from vascular erosion, fistula formation that does not resolve, or failure of conservative therapy

---

### 5. Fistulisation

#### 5.1 Pathophysiology

Fistulisation represents the most extreme form of penetration — the ulcer erodes completely through the bowel wall AND through the wall of an adjacent hollow organ, creating an **abnormal communication** (fistula) between two luminal structures.

**Types:**
- **Gastrocolic fistula** — stomach → transverse colon (the transverse colon lies immediately inferior to the greater curvature)
- **Duodenocolic fistula** — duodenum → colon
- **Choledochoduodenal fistula** — CBD → duodenum (can lead to gallstone ileus via this route)

#### 5.2 Clinical Features [2]

The symptoms are dramatic because colonic content now refluxes into the stomach:
- ***Feculent vomiting*** — the patient vomits material with faecal odour/character (colonic bacteria + faecal matter refluxing into the stomach). This is nearly pathognomonic of a gastrocolic/duodenocolic fistula
- ***Postprandial diarrhoea*** — food bypasses the small bowel absorptive surface by directly entering the colon through the fistula → malabsorption + osmotic diarrhoea
- ***Dyspepsia*** and ***weight loss*** — chronic malabsorption and ongoing inflammation
- Halitosis (faecal breath)

#### 5.3 Management

- Nutritional optimisation (patients are often severely malnourished)
- Surgery: resection of the fistulous tract with repair of both organs involved; typically requires partial gastrectomy or duodenal repair + colonic resection
- IV PPI + *H. pylori* eradication as adjuncts

---

### 6. Malignant Transformation (Gastric Ulcers Only)

#### 6.1 Pathophysiology [2]

- ***Gastric ulcers*** are associated with **pangastritis** → atrophy → intestinal metaplasia → dysplasia → adenocarcinoma. This sequence is driven by chronic inflammation and the loss of specialised gastric glands, with compensatory proliferation of metaplastic epithelium that accumulates genetic mutations over time [2].
- ***Duodenal ulcers*** are associated with antral-predominant gastritis that spares the acid-secreting body → ***no*** atrophy → ***no*** metaplasia → ***does NOT predispose to gastric cancer*** [2].
- A GU that fails to heal after 12 weeks of adequate therapy may harbour an underlying malignancy that was missed on initial biopsy (sampling error) — this is why ***non-healing GU > 3 months requires surgery even if initial biopsy is benign*** [2][3].

<Callout title="DU Does NOT Cause Cancer">
This is a crucial distinction. The acid-hypersecretory, antral-predominant gastritis of DU does not produce the atrophy-metaplasia-dysplasia sequence. Only GU (via pangastritis, atrophy, and intestinal metaplasia) carries a cancer risk. This is why all GU must be biopsied and followed to healing, but uncomplicated DU do not need follow-up endoscopy [2].
</Callout>

### 7. Post-Surgical (Gastrectomy) Complications

When PUD is treated surgically (now rare, but still tested), the altered anatomy creates its own set of problems. These are collectively called **"post-gastrectomy syndromes"** and are important exam material [3].

#### 7.1 Structural/Mechanical Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Anastomotic leak / duodenal stump blowout** | Technical failure at the surgical anastomosis or duodenal stump closure → contents leak into peritoneum | Fever, peritonism, sepsis in the early post-op period | Urgent re-operation; controlled fistula drainage |
| **Afferent loop syndrome** (Billroth II) | Obstruction or kinking of the afferent (duodenal) limb → bile and pancreatic juice accumulate under pressure → sudden decompression | ***Severe epigastric pain → sudden bilious vomiting that relieves the pain*** (the "pressure-release" pattern); abdominal distension [3] | Revise to Roux-en-Y or Braun's enteroenterostomy [3] |
| **Efferent loop obstruction** (Billroth II) | Kinking, adhesion, or herniation of the efferent limb | Gastric outlet obstruction picture (vomiting, distension) | Surgical revision |
| **Marginal (stomal/anastomotic) ulcer** | Ulcer at the surgical anastomotic site — caused by acid exposure at the neo-junction, retained gastric antrum (continued gastrin production), incomplete vagotomy, or *H. pylori* recurrence | Recurrent epigastric pain resembling PUD | Investigate: check for *H. pylori*, retained antrum, ZES; PPI therapy; revise surgery if refractory |
| **Internal hernia** (Petersen's defect) | Bowel herniates through the mesenteric defect created during reconstruction → risk of strangulation | Small bowel obstruction; acute abdominal pain | Urgent surgical reduction |

#### 7.2 Motility-Related Complications ("Post-Gastrectomy Syndromes") [3]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Early dumping syndrome*** | Loss of pylorus → ***rapid gastric emptying of hyperosmolar carbohydrates into small bowel*** → osmotic fluid shift into intestinal lumen → hypovolaemia + distension + ***release of vasoactive gut hormones*** (serotonin, VIP, neurotensin) [3] | 15–30 min post-meal: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, vasomotor symptoms (sweating, flushing, dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations) [3] | ***Small frequent meals, avoid simple carbohydrates***; octreotide for refractory cases [3] |
| ***Late dumping syndrome*** | Rapid glucose absorption → exaggerated insulin release → ***reactive (post-prandial hyperinsulinaemic) hypoglycaemia*** [3] | 2–3 hours post-meal: tremor, diaphoresis, confusion, weakness, hunger [3] | Same dietary advice; glucose for acute episodes |
| **Alkaline reflux gastritis** | Loss of pyloric sphincter → bile refluxes into gastric remnant → bile acids disrupt the mucosal barrier → chronic gastritis | Burning epigastric pain, bilious vomiting; pain is NOT relieved by antacids (because the problem is bile, not acid) | Prokinetics; revision to Roux-en-Y (diverts bile away from gastric remnant) |
| **Gastric stasis / gastroparesis** | Vagal denervation (post-vagotomy) → impaired gastric motility | Early satiety, nausea, vomiting, bloating | Prokinetics (metoclopramide, erythromycin) |
| **Roux stasis syndrome** | Ectopic pacemakers in the Roux limb → net retrograde propulsive activity towards the stomach [3] | Bloating, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, delayed regurgitation | Prokinetics; surgical revision if severe |

#### 7.3 Nutritional Deficiencies [3]

| Deficiency | Mechanism | Consequences | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Vitamin B12 deficiency*** | Loss of parietal cells → ↓ intrinsic factor (intrinsic factor is produced by parietal cells and is required for B12 absorption in the terminal ileum); also ↓ gastric acid → impaired B12 release from food proteins [3] | Megaloblastic anaemia, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, peripheral neuropathy | ***IM B12 every 3 months*** [3] — oral supplementation is ineffective because the problem is lack of intrinsic factor |
| ***Iron deficiency*** | ↓ Gastric acid → impaired conversion of Fe³⁺ (dietary ferric iron) to Fe²⁺ (ferrous iron, the absorbable form); also, bypassing the duodenum (the main site of iron absorption in Billroth II) + chronic blood loss from anastomotic ulcers [3] | Iron-deficiency anaemia (microcytic, hypochromic) | Oral or IV iron supplementation |
| ***Calcium and Vitamin D deficiency*** | ↓ Gastric acid → impaired calcium solubilisation; loss of duodenal continuity (Billroth II/Roux-en-Y) → bypass of the main Ca²⁺ and vitamin D absorption site; fat malabsorption → vitamin D (fat-soluble) malabsorption [3] | **Osteomalacia, osteopenia, osteoporosis**, secondary hyperparathyroidism | Calcium + Vitamin D supplements; DEXA screening |
| **Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)** | Loss of duodenal continuity → reduced mixing of bile/pancreatic enzymes with chyme → fat malabsorption → steatorrhoea → fat-soluble vitamin loss [3] | Night blindness (A), bone disease (D), neuropathy (E), coagulopathy (K) | Vitamin supplementation |
| **Steatorrhoea** | Poor mixing of bile and pancreatic enzymes with food due to Billroth II/Roux-en-Y anatomy → incomplete fat digestion [3] | Fatty diarrhoea, weight loss, malnutrition | Pancreatic enzyme replacement; dietary fat restriction |

<Callout title="Why IM B12 and Not Oral?" type="idea">
After gastrectomy, the patient has lost the parietal cells that produce intrinsic factor. Without intrinsic factor, oral B12 cannot be absorbed in the terminal ileum (B12-IF complex binds to cubam receptors there). Therefore, B12 must be given by the **intramuscular (IM)** route, bypassing the GI tract entirely. This is a lifelong requirement [3].
</Callout>

### 8. Summary — Complications at a Glance

| Complication | Key Pathophysiology | Classic Presentation | Critical Management Point |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Haemorrhage** | Posterior DU → GDA erosion; GU → left gastric a. | Haematemesis, melaena, shock | Endoscopic dual therapy → IV PPI; surgery if fails |
| **Perforation** | Anterior DU → free peritoneal spillage | Thunderclap pain, board-like rigidity, pneumoperitoneum | Omental patch + peritoneal lavage; biopsy GU edges |
| **GOO** | Pyloric fibrosis/oedema → mechanical obstruction | Non-bilious projectile vomiting, succussion splash, hypoCl hypoK metabolic alkalosis | Drip-and-suck → OGD + biopsy (malignant until proven otherwise) |
| **Penetration** | Posterior DU → pancreas (sealed) | Intense back pain, NOT relieved by food | Conservative — surgery NOT recommended |
| **Fistulisation** | Through-and-through into adjacent hollow organ | Feculent vomiting (gastrocolic fistula) | Surgery: resection + repair |
| **Malignancy** | GU → atrophy → metaplasia → dysplasia → CA | Non-healing GU; weight loss | Always biopsy GU; surgery if non-healing > 12 weeks |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. ***Haemorrhage is the leading cause of death*** from peptic ulcer [3]. Posterior DU erodes into GDA; GU on lesser curvature into left gastric artery.
2. ***Risk factors for recurrent bleeding***: patient already hospitalised, large ulcer, posterior D1, higher posterior lesser curve [1].
3. ***Signs of rebleeding***: haematemesis, fresh melaena, tachycardia, falling Hb, blood in NG tube [2].
4. ***Perforation***: MC anterior wall of D1. Chemical peritonitis (first 4–6h) → bacterial peritonitis (after 6h). Erect CXR shows free gas in 60–70%. Do NOT do OGD [3].
5. ***Boey's Score***: delay > 24h (1), SBP < 100 (1), systemic illness (1). Score 3 = 100% mortality [3].
6. ***GOO***: hypochloraemic hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis + paradoxical aciduria. Treat with NS + KCl. GOO is malignant until proven otherwise (80%) [2][3].
7. ***Penetration***: most commonly into pancreas. Pain shifts to localised, intense back pain not relieved by food. Surgery NOT recommended [2].
8. ***Fistulisation***: gastrocolic fistula → feculent vomiting (pathognomonic).
9. ***Malignant transformation***: GU only (via Correa cascade: atrophy → metaplasia → dysplasia → CA). DU does NOT predispose to gastric cancer [2].
10. **Post-gastrectomy syndromes**: early dumping (osmotic shift, 15–30 min), late dumping (reactive hypoglycaemia, 2–3h), afferent loop syndrome (bilious vomiting relieving pain), B12/iron/Ca deficiency.
11. ***IM B12 every 3 months*** is lifelong after gastrectomy — oral B12 is ineffective without intrinsic factor [3].
