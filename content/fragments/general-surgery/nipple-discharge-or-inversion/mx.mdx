## Management Algorithm and Treatment Modalities

The management of nipple discharge and nipple inversion is **cause-directed**. There is no single treatment — the approach depends entirely on what the triple assessment reveals. Think of it as a decision tree: first you identify the underlying cause, then you treat that cause. The nipple discharge or inversion is the *symptom*, not the disease.

The key management principle is straightforward:
1. **Physiological / benign discharge** → reassure, address the underlying cause (e.g. stop offending drug, treat prolactinoma)
2. **Pathological discharge** → surgical excision of the offending duct (diagnostic AND therapeutic)
3. **Malignancy** → treat as breast cancer (surgery ± adjuvant therapy)
4. **Infection/inflammation** → antibiotics ± drainage
5. **Congenital nipple inversion** → reassure; surgical correction only if functional/cosmetic concern
6. **Acquired nipple inversion** → treat the underlying cause

### 2. Management by Underlying Cause — Detailed Treatment Modalities

#### 2A. Galactorrhoea (Milky Bilateral Discharge)

The discharge itself is not the problem — the underlying hormonal derangement is.

##### Medical Treatment

| Cause | Treatment | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prolactinoma** | ***Bromocriptine*** or ***Cabergoline*** [2] | Dopamine agonists → activate D2 receptors on lactotroph cells → restore tonic inhibition of prolactin secretion → prolactin drops → galactorrhoea resolves | Cabergoline is preferred in practice (longer half-life, better tolerated, twice weekly dosing). Bromocriptine ("bromo" = bad smell — patients hate the nausea) requires daily dosing. |
| **Drug-induced** | ***Reassurance and continuation of drug*** OR ***taper or change medication*** [2] | Remove the D2-blocking agent → restore dopaminergic inhibition of prolactin | Always weigh the psychiatric/medical need for the drug vs the discharge. Often the answer is reassurance — galactorrhoea is not harmful. |
| **Hypothyroidism** | Levothyroxine | Corrects low T4 → normalises TRH → removes TRH-mediated prolactin stimulation; also restores metabolic clearance of prolactin | Galactorrhoea typically resolves within weeks of achieving euthyroid state |
| **CKD** | Optimise renal function; dialysis if indicated | Improves renal clearance of prolactin | |

##### Surgical Treatment (Prolactinoma)

- ***Transsphenoidal resection*** [2]
  - **Indication 1**: ***Refractory to dopamine agonists*** — prolactin does not normalise or tumour does not shrink [2]
  - **Indication 2**: ***Women with giant lactotroph adenoma who wish to become pregnant*** — Why? If the patient becomes pregnant and discontinues the dopamine agonist during pregnancy (as is often recommended), a giant adenoma may enlarge to clinically significant size before delivery, causing mass effects (visual field defects, headaches) [2]
  - The approach is "trans-sphenoidal" = through the sphenoid sinus, which sits just below the pituitary fossa — minimally invasive, avoids craniotomy

---

#### 2B. Intraductal Papilloma

> ***Treatment: Microdochectomy — excision of the diseased duct, usually guided by ductogram / ductoscopy*** [1][2][5]

##### Microdochectomy

- "Micro" = small, "docho" = duct (from Greek *dochos*), "ectomy" = excision. Literally: excision of a single small duct.
- **What it involves**: Excision of the **single affected lactiferous duct and its associated lobules** [2]
- **Why it is the standard**: It is both **diagnostic** (the entire duct is sent for histology, excluding DCIS or IDC that may be lurking behind the papilloma) and **therapeutic** (removes the source of discharge)
- **Guidance**: ***Usually guided by ductogram or ductoscopy*** [1][2] — a probe or wire is placed in the discharging duct to guide the surgeon to the correct duct
- **Indication**: ***Persistent spontaneous discharge from a single duct*** [2]; or biopsy-proven papilloma [2]
- **Technique**: A periareolar incision is made, the discharging duct is identified (often by injecting dye or passing a lacrimal probe), and the duct with its associated lobule is excised en bloc
- **Contraindication**: Not appropriate if malignancy is strongly suspected (proceed to oncological surgery instead)

##### Major Duct Excision (Hadfield's Operation)

- **What it involves**: Excision of **all retroareolar (major) ducts** [2]
- **Indication**: ***Persistent spontaneous discharge*** when the offending duct cannot be identified (multi-duct discharge); or recurrent discharge after microdochectomy [2]
- **Consequence**: Loss of ability to breastfeed from the affected breast (all major ducts removed), so it is not first-line in young women who wish to breastfeed
- **Also indicated**: As part of treatment for periductal mastitis with periareolar fistula (total duct excision ± fistulectomy) [2]

<Callout title="Microdochectomy vs Major Duct Excision">
**Microdochectomy** = single duct removed → first-line for single-duct pathological discharge (usually papilloma). **Major duct excision** = all ducts removed → for multi-duct discharge, recurrent discharge, or when the offending duct cannot be localised. Both are diagnostic and therapeutic — the tissue is always sent for histology.
</Callout>

---

#### 2C. Duct Ectasia

##### Conservative Management (First-Line)

- ***Generally does not require surgery*** [2]
- ***Often resolves spontaneously***, sometimes leaving a residual subareolar nodule [2]
- Reassurance is key — this is an **age-related phenomenon** and is ***NOT associated with increased risk of CA breast*** [2]

##### Surgical Management

- ***Microdochectomy*** — indicated if persistent bothersome discharge or nipple inversion is causing functional/cosmetic problems [2][4]
- If complicated by **periductal mastitis or abscess** → treat the infection first (antibiotics, drainage), then consider elective duct excision if recurrent

---

#### 2D. Fibrocystic Breast Changes

Conservative management only — this is a benign, hormone-driven process:

| Treatment | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ***Avoid caffeine*** [4] | Methylxanthines in caffeine may stimulate fibrocystic proliferation (controversial but commonly advised) | Some patients report improvement |
| ***Evening primrose oil*** [4] | Contains gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) → modulates prostaglandin synthesis → may reduce breast pain | Evidence is weak but widely used |
| ***Analgesics (NSAIDs)*** [4] | Anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect | For cyclical mastalgia |
| ***COC (combined oral contraceptives)*** [4] | Suppresses the cyclical hormonal fluctuations (oestrogen and progesterone peaks) that drive fibrocystic changes | Stabilises the hormonal environment |
| **Breast cyst aspiration** | If a dominant cyst is present, FNAC drains the fluid and the lump disappears | Surgery only if recurrent or blood-stained aspirate or solid component present [4] |

---

#### 2E. Malignancy (DCIS, IDC, Paget's Disease)

When malignancy is the cause of nipple discharge or inversion, the management follows **standard breast cancer protocols**. Below is a focused summary relevant to these presentations.

##### Paget's Disease of the Nipple

- ***Treatment should include excision of the underlying cancer and the nipple-areolar complex*** [2]
- ***Both mastectomy or BCT followed by whole-breast irradiation are acceptable treatment options*** [2]
- **Nipple-areolar sparing mastectomy is CONTRAINDICATED** in Paget's disease [9][3] — because the disease involves the nipple epidermis; preserving it would leave tumour behind
- Why BCT is acceptable: If the underlying cancer is small and amenable to wide local excision, the nipple-areolar complex is excised along with the tumour, followed by whole-breast radiotherapy. Cosmesis is poor (no nipple), but oncological outcomes are equivalent to mastectomy.

##### DCIS (Most Common Malignancy Causing Nipple Discharge)

Management depends on the ***Van Nuys Prognostic Index*** [2]:

| Score | Treatment |
|---|---|
| ***Low score*** | ***Wide local excision*** alone [2] |
| **Intermediate score** | **Wide local excision + adjuvant radiotherapy** [2] |
| ***High score*** | ***Mastectomy*** [2] |

Key surgical principles:
- ***Negative resection margins ≥ 2 mm*** [2] — Why 2 mm? DCIS is famous for "skip lesions" (discontinuous spread along ducts), so a wider margin reduces recurrence. The older 10 mm margin has been abandoned as overly aggressive [2].
- ***Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)*** may be considered for DCIS with planned mastectomy or suspicious features — Why? Because if a mastectomy specimen incidentally reveals invasive cancer, SLNB cannot be performed after mastectomy (lymphatic drainage patterns are permanently altered) [2]
- ***ALND is NOT indicated for pure DCIS*** — DCIS by definition does not invade and therefore cannot metastasise to lymph nodes [2]
- **Adjuvant hormonal therapy**: ER-positive DCIS benefits from ***tamoxifen*** (reduces recurrence risk and contralateral cancer risk, but no survival benefit) [2]
- ***No adjuvant chemotherapy*** for DCIS (no added benefit) [2]

##### Invasive Carcinoma (IDC/ILC)

The full breast cancer management is beyond the scope of nipple discharge notes, but the key decision tree for the breast is:

**Breast Management:**

| Option | Approach | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| ***Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) / wide local excision (WLE)*** | Excise tumour with negative margins + ***compulsory adjuvant radiotherapy*** [2][3] | ***Negative margin = "no ink on tumour"*** [3]; positive margin = > 2× increase in ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence [3] |
| ***Mastectomy*** | When BCS is contraindicated or patient preference [3] | Similar efficacy to BCS + RT [3] |

***Contraindications to BCS*** (***must know!***) [3]:
- ***Multicentric disease*** (≥ 2 primary tumours in separate quadrants)
- ***High tumour-to-breast ratio > 20%*** (can be downstaged by neoadjuvant chemotherapy)
- ***Tumour too close to NAC***
- ***Persistent positive resection margin***
- ***Diffuse malignant-appearing calcifications on imaging***
- ***Inflammatory breast cancer***

***Contraindications to radiotherapy*** [3]:
- ***History of RT to affected chest wall / breast***
- ***Pregnancy*** (possible to perform BCS in 3rd trimester and defer RT until after delivery)
- ***Connective tissue disease (e.g. scleroderma, Sjögren's disease)*** — poor skin healing, risk of fistula formation

> ***Types of mastectomy*** [1][9]:
> - ***Modified radical mastectomy***: whole breast + overlying skin + axillary LN (level I + II) [3]
> - ***Simple mastectomy***: clinically node-negative; axillary LN not dissected → SLNB performed [3]
> - ***Skin-sparing mastectomy***: preserves overlying breast skin; C/I if inflammatory breast cancer [3][9]
> - ***Nipple-areolar sparing mastectomy***: preserves NAC dermis/epidermis with removal of major ducts from nipple lumen [2][9]. ***C/I: inflammatory breast cancer, involvement of NAC, nipple retraction, Paget's disease*** [3][9]. ***For selective low-risk patients; no nipple involvement of cancer; prophylactic mastectomy*** [9]

**Axillary Management:**

| Scenario | Management |
|---|---|
| ***Clinically node-negative*** | ***Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)*** [3] |
| ***Clinically node-positive*** (by palpation / USG) | ***Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)*** [3] |
| **SLNB: no metastasis or micrometastasis (≤ 2 mm)** | **No further axillary dissection** [3] |
| **SLNB: macrometastasis ( > 2 mm) in 1–2 LN** | **Controversial** — may omit ALND if receiving breast RT [3] |
| **SLNB: macrometastasis in ≥ 3 LN or extranodal extension** | ***ALND*** [3] |

**Adjuvant Systemic Therapy** — based on ***St Gallen's IHC subtyping*** [3]:

| IHC Subtype | Definition | Adjuvant Therapy |
|---|---|---|
| ***Luminal A*** | ***HR+/HER2-/Ki67 low*** | ***Endocrine therapy alone*** [3] |
| ***Luminal B*** | ***HR+/HER2-/Ki67 high*** | ***Endocrine therapy ± cytotoxic chemotherapy*** [3] |
| ***Luminal B (HER2+)*** | ***HR+/HER2+*** | ***Cytotoxics + anti-HER2 + hormonal therapy*** [3] |
| ***HER2-positive*** | ***HR-/HER2+*** | ***Cytotoxics + anti-HER2 therapy*** [3] |
| ***Triple-negative*** | ***HR-/HER2-*** | ***Cytotoxic therapy*** [3] |

<Callout title="Why Is This Relevant to Nipple Discharge?">
Paget's disease of the nipple is almost always associated with HER2-positive breast cancer. This means the adjuvant treatment will typically include anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab) in addition to surgery. When you see Paget's, think HER2+, think trastuzumab.
</Callout>

---

#### 2F. Lactational Mastitis (± Puerperal Breast Abscess)

##### Conservative / Medical Management

| Treatment | Mechanism | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| **Symptomatic relief** | ***NSAIDs or cold compress*** [2] | Analgesic and anti-inflammatory |
| ***Breastfeeding optimisation*** | ***Complete emptying with pumping or hand expression*** [2] | Removes stagnant milk — the growth medium for bacteria |
| | ***Does NOT require stopping breastfeeding*** [2][4] | Counter-intuitive but essential — continued breastfeeding/pumping prevents engorgement and maintains milk flow |
| ***Antibiotics*** | ***1st generation cephalosporin (cephalexin) or dicloxacillin*** [2] | Covers ***S. aureus*** (most common pathogen); ***cloxacillin*** also mentioned [4] |

##### Breast Abscess Management

- Abscess = ***failure to respond to antibiotics, USG evidence of abscess cavity, or aspiration of pus*** [2]
- ***Needle aspiration*** (USG-guided) — when overlying skin is normal (not ischaemic) [2]
- ***Surgical drainage (incision and drainage, I&D)*** — when there is ***ischaemia or pressure necrosis of overlying skin***, or ***when abscess is not responsive to antibiotics and needle aspiration*** [2]

---

#### 2G. Periductal Mastitis (± Non-Puerperal Abscess ± Periareolar Fistula)

This condition is notoriously recurrent, especially in smokers. The management escalates depending on severity:

| Stage | Treatment | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Uncomplicated periductal mastitis** | ***Empirical antibiotics*** | ***Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin)*** OR ***Dicloxacillin + Metronidazole*** [2]. Why Metronidazole? Because the flora is mixed aerobic-anaerobic (Bacteroides is anaerobic), and Metronidazole covers anaerobes |
| **Subareolar abscess** | ***Antibiotics + abscess drainage*** | ***USG-guided fine needle aspiration*** OR ***incision and drainage (I&D)*** [2] |
| **Periareolar fistula** | ***Fistulectomy + primary closure with antibiotic coverage ± total duct excision*** | ***OR lay open the fistula to allow it to granulate ± total duct excision*** [2]. Total duct excision is added because the underlying diseased ducts are the source of recurrence — if you just close the fistula without removing the ducts, it recurs |
| **Smoking cessation** | Essential for preventing recurrence | Smoking is the major modifiable risk factor — it damages duct epithelium, promotes squamous metaplasia, and drives the entire disease process |

---

#### 2H. Idiopathic Granulomatous Mastitis (IGM)

A **self-limiting** disease that resolves slowly over 9–12 months, but can be extremely distressing [2].

| Treatment | Indication | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **NSAIDs** | Localised pain [2] | First-line symptomatic management |
| ***Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin)*** | ***If Corynebacterium infection is recovered from biopsy*** [2] | Doxycycline for penicillin allergy |
| ***Corticosteroids ± Methotrexate (MTX)*** | ***Patient unresponsive to NSAIDs or antibiotics*** [2] | Reduces swelling but ***may not alter the natural history***; ***discontinuation/tapering is associated with rebound inflammation*** [2] |
| ***Surgical excision: NOT recommended*** | — | ***Surgical excision of IGM is often followed by slow wound healing*** [2] |

<Callout title="IGM — Don't Operate!" type="error">
IGM is one of those conditions where surgery makes things worse. The granulomatous tissue heals poorly, wounds break down, and you end up with a bigger problem than you started with. Patience + NSAIDs + steroids if needed. It will eventually resolve.
</Callout>

---

#### 2I. Congenital Nipple Inversion

- **Reassurance** — this is benign, bilateral, and has no malignancy risk
- **Breastfeeding**: Grade 1 inversion (easily evertible) is usually compatible with breastfeeding. Grade 2–3 may require nipple shields or breast pumps to help with latch
- **Surgical correction** (if desired for cosmetic/functional reasons):
  - Various techniques exist (e.g. purse-string suture, duct division, dermal flaps)
  - **Trade-off**: duct division corrects inversion but sacrifices the ability to breastfeed from that breast
  - Not medically necessary — purely a patient-preference decision

#### 2J. Atypical Ductal/Lobular Hyperplasia (ADH/ALH)

When nipple discharge leads to a biopsy finding of ADH or ALH, management shifts to **cancer risk reduction and surveillance** [2]:

| Treatment | Why? |
|---|---|
| ***Avoidance of OC pills and HRT*** | Removes exogenous oestrogen exposure, reducing the already 5× elevated cancer risk [2] |
| ***Yearly mammography*** | Detect any new malignancy early [2] |
| ***Twice-yearly breast examination*** | Clinical surveillance [2] |
| ***Hormonal therapy — SERMs (tamoxifen) or aromatase inhibitors*** | Chemoprevention — tamoxifen blocks oestrogen receptors in breast tissue, reducing proliferative stimulus; aromatase inhibitors (in postmenopausal women) block peripheral oestrogen synthesis [2] |

---

### 3. Summary Table — Management by Cause

| Cause | First-Line Management | Second-Line / Surgical | Key Principle |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Physiological lactation** | Reassurance | — | Benign; will resolve |
| **Galactorrhoea** | Treat underlying cause (dopamine agonist, stop offending drug, levothyroxine) | Transsphenoidal surgery if refractory prolactinoma | Fix the hormonal problem |
| ***Intraductal papilloma*** | ***Microdochectomy*** (guided by ductogram/ductoscopy) [1] | Major duct excision if recurrent | Diagnostic + therapeutic |
| **Duct ectasia** | Conservative (resolves spontaneously) | Microdochectomy if persistent | NOT cancer risk; benign |
| **Fibrocystic changes** | Avoid caffeine, evening primrose oil, NSAIDs, COC | Cyst aspiration; surgery only if solid/recurrent | Hormonal; cyclical |
| **DCIS** | WLE ± RT (by Van Nuys score) or mastectomy | Tamoxifen if ER+; SLNB if planned mastectomy | Margins ≥ 2 mm |
| **Invasive carcinoma** | BCS + RT or mastectomy + axillary management | Adjuvant systemic therapy by IHC subtype | No ink on tumour |
| **Paget's disease** | Excision of underlying cancer + NAC | Mastectomy or BCT + RT | Nipple-sparing mastectomy C/I |
| **Lactational mastitis** | Antibiotics (cephalexin/dicloxacillin) + continue breastfeeding | Abscess: USG aspiration or I&D | Do NOT stop breastfeeding |
| **Periductal mastitis** | Augmentin or dicloxacillin + metronidazole | Abscess drainage; fistulectomy ± total duct excision | Smoking cessation essential |
| **IGM** | NSAIDs; Augmentin if Corynebacterium | Steroids ± MTX if refractory; do NOT operate | Self-limiting; surgery harms |
| **ADH/ALH** | Surveillance + avoid OC/HRT | Tamoxifen / aromatase inhibitors | 5× cancer risk; monitor |
| **Congenital nipple inversion** | Reassurance | Surgical correction if cosmetic/functional concern | Benign; no cancer risk |
| **Acquired nipple inversion** | Treat underlying cause | Depends on cause | Always exclude malignancy first |

---

### 4. Surgical Procedures — Quick Reference

| Procedure | What Is Excised | Indication | Key Points |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Microdochectomy*** | Single lactiferous duct + associated lobules | ***Persistent spontaneous single-duct discharge*** [1][2]; biopsy-proven papilloma | ***Guided by ductogram/ductoscopy*** [1]; diagnostic + therapeutic; preserves other ducts |
| **Major duct excision (Hadfield's)** | All retroareolar ducts | ***Persistent spontaneous multi-duct discharge*** [2]; recurrent discharge; periductal mastitis with fistula | Sacrifices breastfeeding ability; removes all diseased ducts |
| ***Wide local excision (BCS)*** | Tumour with margin of normal tissue | Early breast cancer (≤ T2, single quadrant, appropriate tumour:breast ratio) | ***Compulsory adjuvant RT*** [2]; ***margin = "no ink on tumour"*** [3] |
| ***Simple mastectomy*** | Entire breast; axilla not dissected | ***Clinically node-negative*** [3][9] | SLNB performed simultaneously |
| ***Modified radical mastectomy*** | Whole breast + overlying skin + axillary LN (level I + II) | Clinically node-positive | More extensive than simple mastectomy [3] |
| ***Skin-sparing mastectomy*** | Breast tissue; preserves overlying skin and inframammary fold | Therapeutic with immediate reconstruction; prophylactic | ***C/I: inflammatory breast cancer*** [3][9] |
| ***Nipple-areolar sparing mastectomy*** | Breast tissue; preserves NAC dermis/epidermis; removes major ducts | ***Selective low-risk patients; no nipple involvement; prophylactic mastectomy*** [9] | ***C/I: inflammatory CA, NAC involvement, nipple retraction/discharge, Paget's disease*** [3][9] |
| **Fistulectomy** | Fistula tract ± total duct excision | Periareolar fistula from periductal mastitis | Combined with antibiotic coverage [2] |
| ***Transsphenoidal resection*** | Pituitary adenoma (prolactinoma) | Refractory to dopamine agonists; giant adenoma + pregnancy planned | Through sphenoid sinus; avoids craniotomy [2] |

---

### 5. Important Contraindications to Remember

| Treatment | Contraindication | Why? |
|---|---|---|
| **BCS/WLE** | ***Multicentric disease, high tumour:breast ratio, persistent positive margins, diffuse malignant calcifications, inflammatory breast cancer, tumour too close to NAC*** [3] | Cannot achieve adequate negative margins with acceptable cosmesis |
| **Adjuvant RT** | ***Prior RT to same area, pregnancy (defer to post-delivery), connective tissue disease (scleroderma, Sjögren's)*** [3] | Excessive cumulative radiation dose; teratogenicity; poor wound healing → fistula |
| ***Nipple-areolar sparing mastectomy*** | ***Inflammatory CA, Paget's disease, nipple retraction, nipple discharge, NAC involvement by cancer*** [3][9] | Leaving the NAC would leave residual tumour behind |
| **Surgical excision for IGM** | Essentially always contraindicated [2] | ***Slow wound healing*** — makes the problem worse [2] |
| **Stopping breastfeeding in lactational mastitis** | ***Does NOT require stopping breastfeeding*** [2][4] | Continued emptying prevents further engorgement and accelerates resolution |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Management">

1. ***Microdochectomy (excision of the diseased duct, guided by ductogram/ductoscopy)*** [1] is the standard surgical treatment for pathological single-duct discharge (papilloma). Major duct excision is for multi-duct or recurrent discharge.

2. **Galactorrhoea**: treat the cause — dopamine agonists for prolactinoma (bromocriptine/cabergoline); stop offending drugs; levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. Transsphenoidal surgery if refractory or giant adenoma + pregnancy desired.

3. **Duct ectasia**: conservative first — often resolves spontaneously. Microdochectomy only if persistent.

4. **Lactational mastitis**: antibiotics (cephalexin/dicloxacillin) + ***continue breastfeeding*** + complete emptying. Abscess → USG aspiration or I&D.

5. **Periductal mastitis**: Augmentin or dicloxacillin + metronidazole. Abscess → drainage. Fistula → fistulectomy ± total duct excision. Smoking cessation is critical.

6. **IGM**: do NOT operate — slow wound healing. NSAIDs first, antibiotics if Corynebacterium, steroids ± MTX if refractory.

7. **Paget's disease**: excise underlying cancer + NAC. Nipple-sparing mastectomy is contraindicated.

8. **DCIS**: WLE with margins ≥ 2 mm ± RT (Van Nuys score) or mastectomy. SLNB if planned mastectomy. Tamoxifen if ER+. No chemotherapy.

9. **Invasive carcinoma**: BCS + compulsory RT or mastectomy; axillary management by SLNB/ALND; adjuvant systemic therapy by IHC subtype (St Gallen's).

10. **Contraindications to BCS**: multicentric disease, high tumour:breast ratio, persistent positive margins, diffuse malignant calcifications, inflammatory breast cancer.
