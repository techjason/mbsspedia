## 1. Definition

**Nipple discharge** refers to any fluid that comes out of the nipple of a non-pregnant, non-lactating breast. It is one of the most common breast complaints presenting to surgical clinics. Strictly speaking, any fluid exiting via the lactiferous duct orifices counts — but clinically we distinguish **physiological** discharge (e.g. lactation, galactorrhoea) from **pathological** discharge, because the latter may harbour malignancy in 5–15% of cases [1][2].

**Nipple inversion** (also called nipple retraction or depression) is the inward pulling of the nipple below the plane of the areola. It can be **congenital** (failure of mesenchymal proliferation to evert the nipple papilla during development) or **acquired** (pulled inward by fibrosis, inflammation, or an underlying malignancy retracting the ducts) [2].

> The lecture slides list nipple changes under the mnemonic **_5Ds: Deviation, Discolouration, Dermatitis, Depression (retraction/inversion), Discharge_** [1][3]. These are the classical nipple signs to look for when assessing any breast complaint.

## 2. Epidemiology

- Nipple discharge accounts for approximately **3–5% of breast-related surgical consultations** and is the **third most common breast complaint** after breast pain and breast lumps.
- Among women presenting with nipple discharge, **malignancy is the underlying cause in ~5–15%** of pathological discharge cases. The most common associated malignancy is **ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)** [2].
- **Intraductal papilloma** is the **single most common cause** of pathological (especially bloody) nipple discharge [2][3].
- Galactorrhoea is common in women of reproductive age; **prolactinoma** is the most common pituitary tumour causing this.
- Congenital nipple inversion is present in roughly **10–20%** of women bilaterally and is benign.
- Acquired nipple inversion is much less common but warrants urgent investigation to exclude malignancy, particularly in unilateral, new-onset cases.

### Hong Kong Context

- Breast cancer is the **most common cancer in Hong Kong women** (Hong Kong Cancer Registry), so any pathological nipple discharge or new nipple inversion must be taken seriously.
- Duct ectasia and periductal mastitis are common in Hong Kong's ageing population and among smokers respectively.
- Current Hong Kong guidance emphasizes **breast awareness** (knowing usual breast appearance/feel and seeking prompt review for changes) plus **risk-based mammography**, rather than routine monthly scheduled breast self-examination for all women [5].

## 4. Anatomy and Function

Understanding the anatomy is essential because nipple discharge and inversion are disorders of the **ductal system** and the **retroareolar structures**.

### 4.1 The Breast — Gross Anatomy

- **_Normal boundaries_**: Superior (2nd rib), Inferior (inframammary fold ~6th–7th rib / upper rectus sheath), Medial (lateral border of sternum), Lateral (mid-axillary line / edge of latissimus dorsi) [3][4].
- **_Depth_**: Breast tissue sits on the **_pre-pectoral fascia_** overlying pectoralis major [4].
- **_Axillary tail (of Spence)_**: extension of breast tissue between pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, blending with axillary fat [4].

### 4.2 The Terminal Ductal-Lobular Unit (TDLU)

The **TDLU** is the functional and structural unit of the breast:

- Each breast contains **15–20 lobes**, each drained by a **lactiferous duct**.
- Each lobe is composed of **lobules** (10–100 per lobe), and each lobule contains acini (milk-producing glands).
- The lobules drain into **ductules** → **segmental ducts** → **lactiferous ducts** → **lactiferous sinuses** (ampullae beneath the areola) → **nipple orifices**.
- The ducts are lined by a double layer: an **inner epithelial (luminal) layer** and an **outer myoepithelial layer**. The myoepithelial cells contract to propel milk toward the nipple.
- **_Ligaments of Cooper_**: fibrous septa that suspend the breast tissue from the skin to the deep fascia. In carcinoma, tumour infiltrating these ligaments causes **skin tethering and dimpling** [4].

### 4.3 The Nipple-Areolar Complex (NAC)

- The **nipple** is a cylindrical protrusion of thickened, pigmented skin containing **15–20 lactiferous duct orifices**. It is richly innervated (T4 dermatome) and has smooth muscle fibres that cause erection in response to cold/touch.
- The **areola** surrounds the nipple and contains:
  - **Montgomery's tubercles** (modified sebaceous glands) — lubricate the nipple during lactation.
  - **Involuntary (smooth) muscle** arranged in concentric rings and radial fibres — when these contract, the nipple becomes erect and shorter, helping with milk ejection.
- **Subareolar ducts** converge beneath the nipple. Pathology in this region (duct ectasia, periductal mastitis, subareolar abscess, central tumour) directly affects nipple appearance and discharge.

### 4.4 Why Does Anatomy Matter for Nipple Discharge and Inversion?

- **Discharge** arises from pathology _within_ the ducts (papilloma, DCIS, duct ectasia) or from _outside_ stimulation of duct secretion (prolactin-mediated galactorrhoea).
- **Inversion** occurs when the subareolar structures (ducts, periductal connective tissue) are shortened or fibrosed. Congenitally, the mesenchyme simply never pushed the papilla out. Acquired inversion means something is pulling the nipple inward — think fibrosis (duct ectasia, mastitis) or infiltration (carcinoma).
- A **single-duct discharge** localises pathology to one duct system (e.g. solitary papilloma, DCIS). **Multiple-duct discharge** is more often benign or systemic (galactorrhoea, fibrocystic changes, duct ectasia).

### 4.5 Vascular Supply (Relevant to Bloody Discharge)

- **_Internal thoracic (mammary) artery_** ← Subclavian artery [4]
- **_Lateral thoracic artery_** ← Axillary artery [4]
- Posterior intercostal arteries
- Intraductal papillomas have **muscularis arteries running through their peduncle** that supply the neoplasm. However, the lymphatics and veins within the papilloma are compromised, leading to elevated vascular pressure and **transudation** of fluid into the duct (serous discharge) or frank bleeding (bloody discharge) when fragile vessels rupture [2].

### 4.6 Lymphatic Drainage

- **_Axillary lymph nodes_** drain ~75% of breast lymph (5 groups: anterior, posterior, medial, lateral, apical) [4].
- **_Internal mammary (parasternal) lymph nodes_** drain medial breast (~25%) — run with the internal thoracic artery [4].
- Lymphatic obstruction by tumour can cause **peau d'orange** (oedema of skin between hair follicle pits).

## 5. Etiology and Pathophysiology

We organise causes of nipple discharge into three broad categories — **lactation/galactorrhoea**, **pathological discharge**, and causes of **nipple inversion**.

### 5.1 Nipple Discharge — Aetiological Categories

#### A. Lactation (Physiological)

- Normal milk production during pregnancy, postpartum and for up to **6 months to 2 years** after cessation of breastfeeding.
- **Bloody nipple discharge** can occur in **~20% of women during the 2nd or 3rd trimester** and during lactation — this is usually benign (caused by rapidly proliferating ductal epithelium and increased vascularity) [2].

#### B. Galactorrhoea (Milky Discharge Unrelated to Breastfeeding)

"Galactorrhoea" → from Greek: _gala_ = milk, _rhoia_ = flow.

- Typically **bilateral**, involving **multiple ducts**, and **milky** in appearance.
- The underlying mechanism is almost always **hyperprolactinaemia** — prolactin is the key hormone driving milk synthesis by mammary alveolar epithelial cells.

**Why does prolactin go up?**

Normally, prolactin secretion from anterior pituitary **lactotroph cells** is under **tonic inhibitory control by dopamine** from the hypothalamus (via the tuberoinfundibular pathway). Anything that:

1. **Produces prolactin autonomously** (prolactinoma),
2. **Blocks dopamine** (drugs), or
3. **Interrupts the dopamine pathway** (stalk compression, infiltrative disease) → removes tonic inhibition → prolactin rises → galactorrhoea.

| Cause                              | Examples                                                                 | Mechanism                                                                         |

|                                    | Head trauma / surgery                                                    | Disrupts hypothalamic-pituitary axis                                              |
| **Drug-induced**                   | **_Antipsychotics_** (haloperidol, risperidone) — most common drug cause | D2 receptor blockade on lactotrophs → removes dopamine inhibition                 |
|                                    | Antiemetics (metoclopramide, domperidone)                                | D2 receptor blockade (same mechanism)                                             |
|                                    | Antidepressants (amitriptyline, clomipramine)                            | Serotonin stimulates prolactin release; some also have mild D2-blocking activity  |
| **Endocrine**                      | Hypothyroidism                                                           | ↑ TRH → TRH stimulates prolactin release; also ↓ metabolic clearance of prolactin |
|                                    | Chronic kidney disease                                                   | ↓ Renal clearance of prolactin                                                    |

<Callout title="Exam Tip — Hypothyroidism and Galactorrhoea">
  A common exam question: *Why does hypothyroidism cause galactorrhoea?* Two

#### C. Pathological Nipple Discharge

This is the category that surgeons worry about. The hallmarks of pathological discharge are:

- **_Spontaneous_** (comes out without squeezing)
- **_Persistent_**
- **_Unilateral_**
- **_Single-duct_**
- **_Serous (clear/yellow), sanguineous (bloody), or serosanguineous (blood-tinged)_**

> **_Key slide point_**: History must determine — _unilateral or bilateral, blood-stained/milky/serous, spontaneous or on manual expression; on examination — single duct or multiple duct, nature/colour of discharge, any palpable breast mass or axillary lymph node_ [1].

Muscularis arteries run through the peduncle supplying the papilloma, but veins and lymphatics are compromised → elevated intravascular pressure → transudation (serous) or rupture of fragile vessels (bloody) [2]                                                                        |

### 5.2 Nipple Inversion — Aetiological Categories

#### A. Congenital Nipple Inversion

- Usually **bilateral** and **benign**.
- Results from **failure of the underlying mesenchymal tissue to proliferate and project the nipple papilla outwards** during development [2].
- Very common (~10–20% of women). The nipple can often be manually everted.
- **No association with malignancy**.

#### B. Acquired Nipple Inversion

Acquired = **new-onset** in someone who previously had a normal, everted nipple. This is the clinically worrying scenario.

| Cause                                            | Mechanism of Inversion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Underlying malignancy_** (breast carcinoma)   | Tumour grows along/around the lactiferous ducts → fibrotic reaction and direct shortening/retraction of ducts → pulls nipple inward. A central/retroareolar tumour is the classic culprit. The retraction is usually **unilateral**, **progressive**, and **irreversible** (you cannot manually evert the nipple) |
| **_Duct ectasia_**                               | Dilated subareolar ducts undergo periductal fibrosis → the fibrotic tissue contracts → retracts nipple [2][4]                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **_Periductal mastitis_**                        | Chronic periductal inflammation → fibrosis → shortening of ducts → retraction [2]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **_Subareolar abscess and periareolar fistula_** | Abscess formation and healing with scar tissue → duct damage → fibrosis and retraction [2]                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **_Tuberculosis mastitis_**                      | Granulomatous inflammation → extensive fibrosis → retraction (rare but seen in TB-endemic areas) [2]                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **_Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM)_**    | Non-caseating granulomatous inflammation of unknown aetiology → fibrosis → retraction [2]                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## 6. Classification

### 6.1 Classification of Nipple Discharge by Nature

| Type                        | Appearance                      | Significance                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Milky**                   | White, opaque                   | Lactation or galactorrhoea — almost always benign/systemic                                           |
| **Serous**                  | Clear or yellow, straw-coloured | Intraductal papilloma (classical), fibrocystic changes, rarely DCIS                                  |
| **Bloody / Sanguineous**    | Red, frank blood                | Intraductal papilloma (bleeding), DCIS, IDC, fibrocystic changes with active intraductal hyperplasia |
| **Serosanguineous**         | Blood-tinged yellow/pink        | Same differential as bloody                                                                          |
| **Purulent**                | Opaque, yellow-green, foul      | Mastitis, periductal mastitis, breast abscess                                                        |
| **Multi-coloured / cheesy** | Green, blue, black, creamy      | Duct ectasia (classical)                                                                             |

### 6.2 Classification by Clinical Significance

**Physiological/Benign:**

- Bilateral, multi-duct, non-spontaneous (only on expression), milky
- E.g. Lactation, galactorrhoea, fibrocystic changes

**Pathological/Suspicious:**

- **_Unilateral, single-duct, spontaneous, persistent, serous or bloody_**
- E.g. Intraductal papilloma, DCIS, IDC

This distinction matters because **pathological discharge** mandates triple assessment and often surgical intervention, whereas **physiological discharge** can often be managed conservatively.

### 6.3 Grading of Nipple Inversion (Han & Hong Classification)

| Grade       | Description                                             | Implication                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Grade 1** | Nipple easily everted manually and maintains projection | Minimal fibrosis; often congenital; breastfeeding usually possible                                        |
| **Grade 2** | Nipple can be everted but retracts immediately          | Moderate fibrosis; some difficulty breastfeeding                                                          |
| **Grade 3** | Nipple cannot be everted at all                         | Severe fibrosis or underlying mass pulling it in; breastfeeding not possible; **must exclude malignancy** |

## 7. Clinical Features

### 7.1 Symptoms (What the Patient Tells You)

| Symptom                                                       | Pathophysiological Basis                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nipple discharge** — spontaneous staining of bra/clothing   | Fluid produced by intraductal pathology (papilloma, DCIS) or secretory stimulation (prolactin) exceeds the duct's capacity → leaks out spontaneously |
| **Bloody discharge**                                          | Fragile vessels in a papilloma rupture or tumour necrosis (DCIS comedo-type) erodes vessel walls → blood mixes with ductal fluid                     |
| **Milky discharge** unrelated to breastfeeding                | Hyperprolactinaemia stimulates alveolar epithelial cells to produce casein, lactose, and lipid → milky secretion                                     |
| **Creamy/cheesy/multi-coloured discharge**                    | Inspissated (thickened, dried) secretions in dilated ectatic ducts break down and change colour (lipofuscin pigment → green/blue/black)              |
| **Purulent discharge**                                        | Bacterial infection in periductal tissue or abscess cavity → pus drains via the duct                                                                 |
| **Nipple sinking inward (inversion)**                         | Fibrosis shortening ducts (duct ectasia, periductal mastitis) or tumour infiltrating and retracting ducts                                            |
| **Breast lump** (associated)                                  | Underlying papilloma (small, subareolar), carcinoma (hard, irregular), or abscess (tender, fluctuant)                                                |
| **Breast pain**                                               | Engorgement (lactational mastitis), cyst enlargement (fibrocystic changes), abscess formation (infection), or inflammatory carcinoma                 |
| **Eczema / itching of nipple**                                | **_Paget's disease — malignant Paget cells in the epidermis trigger an inflammatory/eczematous reaction_** [1]                                       |
| **Constitutional symptoms** (weight loss, fatigue, bone pain) | Suggest advanced malignancy with metastatic disease                                                                                                  |

#### Key History Points to Elicit

As taught on the lecture slides [1]:

> **_Symptom history_**: _Unilateral or bilateral? Blood-stained, milky, or serous? Spontaneous or on manual expression?_
>
> **_Sign history_**: _Single duct or multiple duct? Colour of discharge? Any palpable breast mass? Axillary lymph nodes?_

Additional history:

- Recent pregnancy / breastfeeding? (→ lactation vs pathological)
- Medications? (→ drug-induced galactorrhoea)
- Menstrual history? (→ cyclical changes suggest fibrocystic disease)
- Duration and progression? (→ new and progressive = worrying)
- Risk factors for breast cancer? (→ family history, BRCA status, prior breast disease, oestrogen exposure)

### 7.2 Signs (What You Find on Examination)

Physical examination follows the standard breast examination approach [3][4]:

**Position**: 45° upright or sitting, exposure from clavicle to upper abdomen, both breasts and axillae exposed.

#### Inspection

| Sign                                             | What It Looks Like                                                      | Pathophysiological Basis                                                                                                                                                               |

| **_Nipple discharge_** (express or spontaneous)  | Fluid from nipple orifice — note colour, duct involved                  | See above; single duct → focal pathology; multiple ducts → diffuse/systemic                                                                                                            |
| **_Nipple inversion / retraction (Depression)_** | Nipple pulled below the areolar plane                                   | Fibrosis (duct ectasia, mastitis) or tumour infiltration shortening the ducts                                                                                                          |

| **_Nipple discolouration_**                      | Darkening or erythema of nipple/areola                                  | Increased vascularity (inflammation) or Paget's disease                                                                                                                                |
| **_Nipple eczema / dermatitis_**                 | Scaly, crusted, erythematous, ulcerated nipple                          | **_Paget's disease — malignant Paget cells in the epidermis cause thickening, scaling, and ulceration of the nipple-areolar skin_** [1]                                                |
| **Skin dimpling / tethering**                    | Skin puckers when arms raised                                           | Tumour infiltrating **_Cooper's ligaments_** → shortens them → pulls skin inward [4]                                                                                                   |
| **Peau d'orange**                                | Skin resembles orange peel (oedema with pitting at hair follicle sites) | Tumour blocks dermal lymphatics → lymphoedema; the hair follicles and sweat gland openings are tethered and don't swell → the surrounding oedematous skin protrudes around them [2][3] |
| **Erythema / swelling**                          | Red, warm, swollen breast                                               | Infection (mastitis/abscess) or inflammatory breast cancer (tumour in dermal lymphatics)                                                                                               |

| **Trigger point for discharge** | Pressing on a specific area produces discharge from a single duct | Helps localise the pathological duct (valuable for planning microdochectomy)                                           |
| **Axillary lymphadenopathy**    | Hard, matted, fixed nodes                                         | Metastatic carcinoma; soft, tender nodes suggest reactive/infective                                                    |

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl — How to Express Nipple Discharge">
  To determine the involved duct, gently compress the breast in a radial fashion
  (like "clock positions") moving toward the nipple. If pressure at a specific
  clock position produces discharge from a single duct orifice, this localises
  the pathological duct to that segment. This is the basis of microdochectomy
  planning.
</Callout>

#### Special Manoeuvres

- **Hands on hips / press inward** → contracts pectoralis major → accentuates skin dimpling/tethering and fixation to muscle.
- **Arms overhead** → stretches skin → reveals subtle skin changes and asymmetry.
- **Lean forward** → breasts hang freely → any mass fixed to the chest wall will not swing with the breast.

## 8. Specific Conditions Causing Nipple Discharge or Inversion — Pathophysiology Deep Dive

### 8.1 Intraductal Papilloma

- **"Papilloma"** → from Latin _papilla_ (nipple-like projection) + Greek _-oma_ (tumour). Literally a nipple-like tumour _within a duct_.
- A **benign papillary neoplasm** of the ductal epithelium with a **fibrovascular core** (stalk/peduncle).
- Can be **solitary** (central, subareolar — classic presentation with discharge) or **multiple** (peripheral — **_diffuse papillomatosis_** defined as ≥ 5 papillomas within a localised segment) [2].
- **_Multiple papillomas carry an increased risk of breast cancer_** [4].
- **Pathophysiology of discharge**: The peduncle contains **muscularis arteries** that adequately supply the papilloma, but the **lymphatics and veins are compromised** → ↑ vascular pressure → transudate forms in the duct (serous discharge). If the fragile vessels rupture → bloody discharge [2].
- Diagnosed by **core needle biopsy** [2].
- Managed by **_microdochectomy_** (surgical excision of the single affected lactiferous duct and its associated lobules) — this is the **standard approach** [2][4].

### 8.2 Duct Ectasia

- "Ectasia" → from Greek _ektasis_ = dilation/stretching.
- Characterised by **_abnormal dilatation of subareolar ducts with fibrosis and inflammation_** [4].
- An **age-related** phenomenon primarily affecting **older women** [2].
- **_NOT associated with increased risk of breast cancer_** [2].
- **_NOT associated with significant periareolar inflammation or infection_** (distinguishing it from periductal mastitis) [2].
- **Pathophysiology**: Subareolar ducts dilate → secretions become stagnant and inspissated → cheesy material accumulates → periductal fibrosis develops → nipple retraction. If ducts become blocked → predisposes to secondary periductal mastitis or abscess.
- **Clinical features**: **_Palpable subareolar mass, nipple inversion, creamy cheesy nipple discharge that is multi-coloured (green/blue/black, occasionally blood-stained)_** [2].
- **Management**: Conservative (often resolves spontaneously, sometimes with residual subareolar nodule). **_Microdochectomy_** if persistent [2].

### 8.3 Periductal Mastitis

- Inflammatory condition of the subareolar ducts with **unknown aetiology**.
- Affects **_young women_** — **_majority are smokers_** [2].
- **Pathophysiology**: Smoking is thought to damage the subareolar duct epithelium either directly (toxic metabolites in breast secretions) or via ischaemia → squamous metaplasia of duct lining → keratinous debris plugs the duct → secondary bacterial infection → periductal inflammation → abscess formation → duct rupture → periareolar fistula.
- **Organisms**: Staphylococci, Streptococci, Enterococci, Bacteroides, Proteus (mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora) [2].
- **Clinical features**: Painful, tender retroareolar mass; purulent nipple discharge; subareolar abscess; periareolar fistula (communication between a subareolar duct and the skin).
- **Management**: Antibiotics (Augmentin or Dicloxacillin + Metronidazole); abscess drainage (USG-guided FNA or I&D); fistulectomy ± total duct excision [2].

### 8.4 Fibrocystic Breast Changes (FBC)

- The **_most frequent benign disorder of the breast_** [2].
- Not a single disease but a **spectrum of histopathological changes**: stromal fibrosis, macro/microcysts, apocrine metaplasia, hyperplasia, adenosis [2].
- Affects **premenopausal** women; driven by **oestrogen predominance over progesterone**.
- Discharge (serous or serosanguineous) occurs when there is an **active intraductal component** — intraductal hyperplasia or cystic fluid leakage.
- Usually associated with **cyclical mastalgia** and **nodularity** (upper outer quadrant).

### 8.5 Paget's Disease of the Nipple

- **_Eczematous changes involving the nipple, associated with malignancy within the same breast_** [1].
- **_Malignant epithelial (Paget) cells infiltrate and proliferate in the epidermis, causing thickening of the nipple and areolar skin_** [1].
- **_Almost always (~80%) associated with underlying breast cancer, which is HER2-positive_** [2].
- Presents with **_pain, burning, pruritus, palpable breast mass, bloody nipple discharge, or nipple inversion_** [2].
- **Pathogenesis**: Two theories:
  1. **Epidermotropic theory** (favoured): Malignant ductal cells migrate from an underlying DCIS or invasive carcinoma along the lactiferous ducts to colonise the nipple epidermis.
  2. **In-situ transformation theory**: Epidermal keratinocytes undergo malignant transformation independently.
- **Diagnosis**: **_Full-thickness wedge biopsy of the nipple and underlying breast tissue_** — pathological hallmark is **_malignant intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells (Paget cells) within the nipple epidermis_** [2].
- **Mammography is mandatory** to look for associated mass and exclude synchronous cancers or widespread calcification [2].
- **Treatment**: Excision of the underlying cancer AND the nipple-areolar complex — **_both mastectomy or BCT followed by whole-breast irradiation are acceptable_** [2].

<Callout title="Exam Pearl — Paget's Disease" type="error">
  Any unilateral nipple eczema in a middle-aged/older woman is Paget's disease
  until proven otherwise. Do NOT treat with steroid cream without biopsy.
  Paget's is almost always associated with underlying breast cancer
  (HER2-positive in majority). Mammography is mandatory.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Nipple discharge** is classified as physiological (lactation, galactorrhoea) or pathological (serous, bloody, purulent). Pathological discharge is spontaneous, unilateral, single-duct, and serous/bloody.

2. **Intraductal papilloma** is the most common cause of pathological (especially bloody) nipple discharge. The bloody/serous discharge results from compromised venous/lymphatic drainage in the papilloma's peduncle.

3. **Malignancy (DCIS > IDC)** accounts for 5–15% of pathological nipple discharge. DCIS is the most common malignancy associated.

4. **Galactorrhoea** = milky, bilateral, multi-duct. Think hyperprolactinaemia — prolactinoma, drugs (antipsychotics/antiemetics), hypothyroidism, CKD.

5. **Duct ectasia** = older women, cheesy multi-coloured discharge, nipple inversion, NOT increased cancer risk.

6. **Paget's disease** = unilateral nipple eczema + underlying breast cancer (HER2+ in ~80%). Paget cells in nipple epidermis. Biopsy is mandatory. Do NOT treat as dermatitis without histology.

7. **Nipple inversion**: Congenital (bilateral, benign, manually evertible) vs Acquired (unilateral, progressive, must exclude malignancy). Acquired causes: carcinoma, duct ectasia, periductal mastitis, abscess/fistula, TB, IGM.

8. **5Ds of nipple changes**: Deviation, Discolouration, Dermatitis, Depression (retraction/inversion), Discharge.

9. **History essentials** for nipple discharge: unilateral/bilateral, colour, spontaneous/expressed, single/multiple duct, associated mass/lymphadenopathy, pregnancy/lactation, medications, cancer risk factors.

10. **All pathological nipple discharge requires triple assessment** (clinical + radiological + pathological).

Breast carcinoma: tumour grows along or around lactiferous ducts, causes a desmoplastic (fibrotic) reaction and directly shortens/retracts the ducts, pulling the nipple inward. Carcinoma-related inversion is typically unilateral, progressive, and non-evertible.",
