## Complications of Nipple Discharge and Inversion

Complications in this context arise from two distinct angles: (1) complications of the **underlying conditions** themselves if untreated or under-recognised, and (2) complications of the **treatments/procedures** used to manage them. We will cover both systematically.

The key conceptual framework: nipple discharge and nipple inversion are *symptoms*, not diseases. So the complications we discuss are really the complications of what causes them (papilloma, duct ectasia, mastitis, carcinoma) and the complications of what we do about them (microdochectomy, major duct excision, mastectomy, ALND).

### 1. Complications of Underlying Conditions

#### 1A. Complications of Untreated or Missed Pathological Nipple Discharge

| Complication | Mechanism | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Missed malignancy (DCIS → invasive carcinoma)** | DCIS is a precursor to invasive ductal carcinoma at a rate of ~1%/year [2]. If pathological discharge caused by DCIS is dismissed as benign (e.g. attributed to duct ectasia without biopsy), the window for curative treatment of non-invasive disease is lost | This is the single most important complication — the entire reason we investigate pathological discharge is to catch malignancy early. DCIS caught and treated has an excellent prognosis; IDC that has spread to lymph nodes does not |
| **Progression of intraductal papilloma** | While a solitary papilloma is benign, multiple papillomas (papillomatosis) carry an increased risk of breast cancer. Without excision, the risk of missing concurrent atypia or DCIS within the papilloma is ~10–15% | This is why microdochectomy is both diagnostic and therapeutic — the excised duct is sent for full histological assessment |
| **Psychological distress and anxiety** | Persistent bloody or spontaneous discharge is extremely distressing for patients who worry about cancer | Even if benign, untreated discharge causes significant quality-of-life impairment |

#### 1B. Complications of Duct Ectasia

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Periductal mastitis*** [2][4] | Blocked, dilated ducts provide a nidus for secondary bacterial infection → periductal inflammation. This is the most common complication of duct ectasia. Why does duct blockage cause infection? Stagnant inspissated secretions create a warm, nutrient-rich, stagnant environment ideal for bacterial colonisation |
| ***Breast abscess*** [4] | Periductal mastitis that progresses without adequate treatment → localised collection of pus (abscess). Abscess may be subareolar and initially non-fluctuant, making clinical detection tricky |
| **Nipple retraction/inversion** | Progressive periductal fibrosis from chronic inflammation → shortening of the duct → pulls the nipple inward. This is the mechanism of nipple inversion in duct ectasia [2] |

#### 1C. Complications of Lactational Mastitis

| Complication | Mechanism | Incidence |
|---|---|---|
| ***Breast abscess (puerperal)*** | Mastitis ***progresses to abscess formation in 25% of patients*** [2]. Organisms (*S. aureus* most commonly) continue to multiply in stagnant infected milk → walled-off collection of pus forms. ***Breast abscess occurs in late stage and is often NOT fluctuant*** — making clinical detection difficult [2] | 25% of untreated mastitis cases |
| **Sepsis** | Severe untreated mastitis with systemic spread → bacteraemia → septic shock. Rare but life-threatening | Rare |
| **Cessation of breastfeeding** | Pain, fear, and misinformation lead patients to stop breastfeeding prematurely. This paradoxically worsens engorgement and can worsen the mastitis. ***Does NOT require stopping breastfeeding*** [2] — continued emptying is therapeutic | Common |
| **Recurrence** | Incomplete antibiotic course or persistent breastfeeding difficulties (poor latch, incomplete emptying) | Common in first-time mothers |

#### 1D. Complications of Periductal Mastitis

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Subareolar abscess** | Secondary bacterial infection of inflamed periductal tissue → abscess formation in the subareolar region. The mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora (Staphylococci, Bacteroides) makes this particularly aggressive [2] |
| ***Periareolar fistula*** | ***Secondary infection of inflamed ducts → duct damage and subsequent rupture → abscess formation → draining fistula (communication between a major subareolar duct and the skin)*** [2]. This is the hallmark chronic complication of periductal mastitis. A fistula will NOT heal on its own because the underlying diseased duct keeps producing secretions that feed the infection cycle |
| **Recurrence** | Extremely common, especially if the patient continues smoking. Smoking damages duct epithelium → squamous metaplasia → keratinous plugging → reinfection. Without smoking cessation, the cycle repeats |
| **Nipple retraction** | Chronic inflammation → progressive fibrosis → duct shortening → retraction [2] |

#### 1E. Complications of Idiopathic Granulomatous Mastitis (IGM)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Chronic draining sinuses** | Granulomatous inflammation → tissue breakdown → sinus tracts to skin. These are notoriously slow to heal |
| **Poor wound healing post-surgery** | ***Surgical excision of IGM is often followed by slow wound healing*** [2]. The granulomatous tissue has poor vascularity and chronic inflammation that impairs normal wound healing processes |
| **Rebound inflammation** | ***Discontinuation or tapering of corticosteroids is associated with rebound inflammation*** [2]. The granulomatous process flares when the immunosuppressive effect of steroids is removed |
| **Misdiagnosis as carcinoma** | ***IGM mimics CA breast*** [2] clinically and radiologically. The complication here is unnecessary cancer treatment (mastectomy) for a benign, self-limiting condition — this is why core biopsy is essential |

#### 1F. Complications of Breast Cancer (When Nipple Discharge/Inversion Is the Presenting Feature)

If the underlying cause is malignancy and it is not caught early, the complications are those of advanced breast cancer:

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Local invasion** | Tumour invades Cooper's ligaments (skin tethering/dimpling), pectoralis fascia (fixation), dermal lymphatics (peau d'orange, inflammatory breast cancer) | ***Skin dimpling, peau d'orange, chest wall fixation*** [2] |
| ***Axillary lymphadenopathy*** | Metastatic spread via lymphatics to axillary lymph nodes | Hard, fixed, matted nodes [2] |
| ***Distant metastasis*** | Haematogenous spread to common sites | ***Bone (back pain), liver (jaundice, hepatomegaly), lung (dyspnoea, cough), brain (headache, neurological deficits)*** [2] |
| **Locally advanced disease** | Neglected cancer → skin ulceration, fungation, pain | Quality of life devastation |

### 2. Complications of Treatment

#### 2A. Complications of Microdochectomy / Major Duct Excision

These are relatively minor procedures, but complications can still occur:

| Complication | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Wound infection** | Bacterial contamination of the periareolar incision | Uncommon; managed with antibiotics |
| **Haematoma** | Bleeding from divided vessels in the retroareolar space | Small haematomas resorb; large ones may need evacuation |
| **Nipple necrosis** | Disruption of blood supply to the nipple-areolar complex during dissection | Rare in microdochectomy (only one duct dissected); more common in major duct excision where all retroareolar tissue is dissected |
| **Altered nipple sensation** | Division of small sensory nerve branches around the nipple | Common; usually transient, but can be permanent |
| **Loss of ability to breastfeed** | Microdochectomy: loss of one duct segment (minimal impact on overall lactation). Major duct excision: loss of ALL ducts (complete loss of breastfeeding ability on that side) | Important to counsel young women who wish to breastfeed in the future |
| **Nipple inversion (iatrogenic)** | Removal of subareolar tissue leaves a void → scar contracture pulls the nipple inward | Paradoxically, the treatment for discharge can *cause* the inversion you were trying to evaluate |
| **Recurrence of discharge** | Incomplete excision of the diseased duct, or pathology in a different duct system | Major duct excision is the fallback if microdochectomy fails |
| **Cosmetic deformity** | Volume loss in the retroareolar area after excision of duct tissue | Usually minimal for microdochectomy; more noticeable for major duct excision |

#### 2B. Complications of Mastectomy

When nipple discharge or inversion leads to a diagnosis of breast cancer requiring mastectomy, the complications are:

**General complications** [2]:
- ***Wound infection***
- ***Bleeding and haematoma***
- ***Anaesthetic complications***

**Specific complications** [2][3]:

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Seroma*** | ***Collection of serous fluid*** in the dead space created by removal of breast tissue and disruption of lymphatics. ***Untreated seroma results in delayed wound healing, wound infection and dehiscence, flap necrosis and poor cosmetic outcomes*** [2] | ***Insertion of drains (Jackson-Pratt drain) or percutaneous aspiration*** [2][3]. Drains removed when output < 30 mL/day × 2 days [3] |
| ***Skin flap necrosis*** | Ischaemia of the thin skin flaps created during mastectomy — the blood supply to the flap edges may be compromised, especially if flaps are thin or tension is excessive | ***Full-thickness skin flap necrosis requires surgical debridement and may require skin grafting*** [2] |
| ***Post-mastectomy pain syndrome*** | ***Burning, aching and tight constriction of axilla, upper arm and chest wall*** [2]. Caused by damage to intercostal nerves, intercostobrachial nerve, and chest wall trauma. Neuropathic in nature | Chronic pain management: gabapentin/pregabalin, physiotherapy |
| ***Phantom breast syndrome*** | ***Change in chest wall sensation; exact cause unknown*** [2]. Analogous to phantom limb pain — the brain's cortical representation of the breast persists even after removal. ***May persist years after surgery*** [3] | Difficult to treat; psychological support, neuropathic pain agents |
| ***Arm morbidity*** | ***Includes arm or shoulder pain, swelling, numbness, stiffness*** [2]. Caused by surgical disruption of axillary structures, lymphatic channels, and nerves | Physiotherapy, pneumatic compression (for lymphoedema) |
| ***Skin flap / NAC necrosis (if reconstruction)*** [3] | Compromised blood supply to preserved skin or NAC during skin-sparing or nipple-sparing mastectomy | Debridement; may need revision surgery |
| ***Frozen shoulder*** [3] | Post-operative immobilisation and pain lead to adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder joint | Early physiotherapy and mobilisation are essential |

#### 2C. Complications of Axillary Surgery (SLNB and ALND)

Axillary surgery is performed when nipple discharge or inversion is caused by malignancy and axillary staging is needed.

> ***Axillary dissection: removal of level I and II lymph nodes, pectoralis minor as the landmark. Preservation of (special caution to): long thoracic nerve, thoracodorsal nerve, intercostobrachial nerves*** [1]

> ***Complications: lymphoedema (up to 10–20% risk), nerve injuries, general surgical complications (skin infection, scar etc), frozen shoulder*** [1]

| Complication | Nerve/Structure Injured | Clinical Result | Why? |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Lymphoedema*** [1][3] | Disruption of axillary lymphatic channels | Chronic swelling of the ipsilateral arm; can be progressive and debilitating | Lymph from the arm normally drains through axillary nodes → removing these nodes disrupts drainage → lymph fluid accumulates in the arm. ***Up to 10–20% risk*** [1]. Management: ***pneumatic compression device*** [3] |
| ***Winged scapula*** [1][3] | ***Long thoracic nerve*** injury | Medial border of scapula protrudes posteriorly; inability to abduct arm above 90° | The long thoracic nerve innervates serratus anterior, which holds the scapula against the chest wall. If denervated → scapula "wings" off the chest wall during arm elevation |
| ***Weak shoulder adduction and internal rotation*** [1][3] | ***Thoracodorsal nerve*** injury | Weakness of latissimus dorsi → difficulty pulling arm downward and inward | The thoracodorsal nerve innervates latissimus dorsi. Injury → weak adduction and internal rotation of the shoulder |
| ***Loss of pectoralis major function*** [3] | ***Medial pectoral nerve*** injury | Weakness/atrophy of pectoralis major | The medial pectoral nerve innervates the pectoralis major. This nerve runs medially to pec minor and can be injured during level II dissection |
| ***Paraesthesia of axilla, medial arm, and lateral chest wall*** [1][3] | ***Intercostobrachial nerve*** injury | Numbness or tingling sensation in the distribution of T2 dermatome (medial arm, axilla, lateral chest) | The intercostobrachial nerve is a cutaneous branch of T2 that crosses the axilla. It is frequently sacrificed during ALND. The sensory loss is permanent but not disabling |
| **Seroma** [3] | Disruption of lymphatic channels in axilla | Fluid collection in the axilla | Managed by aspiration or drain placement |
| ***Upper limb lymphangiosarcoma (Stewart-Treves syndrome)*** [3] | Chronic lymphoedema → malignant transformation of lymphatic endothelial cells | Rare but devastating angiosarcoma of the chronically oedematous arm, typically appearing 5–15 years after surgery | Very rare; the chronic stagnation and impaired immune surveillance in oedematous tissue allow malignant transformation |

<Callout title="Four Nerves at Risk in ALND — Must Know!" type="error">
In any exam question about axillary surgery complications, you need to name these four nerves and what happens when each is injured:
1. **Long thoracic nerve** → serratus anterior → winged scapula
2. **Thoracodorsal nerve** → latissimus dorsi → weak adduction and internal rotation
3. **Medial pectoral nerve** → pectoralis major → weak arm flexion/adduction
4. **Intercostobrachial nerve** → T2 cutaneous sensation → paraesthesia of axilla, medial arm, lateral chest wall

The intercostobrachial nerve is most commonly injured because it directly crosses the operative field.
</Callout>

#### 2D. Complications of Breast Reconstruction (If Performed After Mastectomy)

When mastectomy is performed for breast cancer presenting with nipple discharge or inversion, reconstruction may be offered. Complications depend on the reconstruction method:

**Autologous tissue reconstruction** [2]:

| Flap Type | Key Complication | Why? |
|---|---|---|
| ***TRAM flap (Transverse Rectus Abdominis Muscle)*** | ***Higher chance of hernia*** without abdominal muscles [2]; donor site morbidity (abdominal wall weakness) | The rectus abdominis muscle is harvested, leaving the abdominal wall weakened → risk of incisional hernia |
| ***LD flap (Latissimus Dorsi)*** | Donor site seroma; shoulder weakness | Loss of latissimus dorsi function (usually well-compensated by other muscles) |
| ***DIEP flap (Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator)*** | ***Complications rate is higher since the vessels are much smaller*** [2]; risk of flap failure from microvascular thrombosis | The perforator vessels are tiny → technically demanding microsurgery → higher flap loss rate. But it ***spares the muscle from graft harvest*** [2], preserving abdominal wall integrity |

**Prosthetic devices (implants)** [3]:

| Complication | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ***Mechanical complications: migration, malposition, exposure, rupture*** [3] | Implant shifts, the pocket fails, or the shell degrades over time. ***Majority of ruptures are often silent*** [3] | ***Present with changes in breast shape/volume, capsular contracture, palpable lumps (breast or axilla), and pain*** [3] |
| ***Implant infections*** [3] | Bacterial contamination during surgery or haematogenous seeding | ***Managed by antibiotics ± explantation and irrigation of the pocket → closure over closed suction drainage*** [3] |
| ***Capsular contracture*** [3] | ***Especially post-infection or radiation*** [3]. The body forms a fibrous capsule around any implant (foreign body reaction); if this capsule contracts excessively → ***painful, fibrous capsule around implant → palpable distortion of breast*** [3] | The Baker classification grades capsular contracture I–IV. Grade III–IV require surgical revision (capsulotomy or capsulectomy) |
| ***Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL)*** [3] | ***ALK-negative, CD30-positive*** lymphoma arising from the capsule around textured implants. The chronic inflammatory stimulus of the textured surface is thought to drive T-cell transformation | ***Disease confined to the capsule: capsulectomy alone is curative. Adjuvant therapies: chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or anti-CD30 (brentuximab vedotin)*** [3] |

<Callout title="BIA-ALCL — Rare But Must-Know">
Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a rare T-cell lymphoma associated with textured breast implants. It typically presents as a late-onset seroma around the implant (months to years after insertion). If confined to the capsule, complete capsulectomy is curative. It is ALK-negative and CD30-positive — this distinguishes it from systemic ALCL and makes it amenable to anti-CD30 targeted therapy (brentuximab vedotin).

#### 2E. Complications of Radiotherapy (Adjuvant to BCS)

When BCS is performed for cancer causing nipple discharge/inversion, adjuvant RT is compulsory. Complications include:

| Complication | Mechanism | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| **Acute skin reactions** (erythema, desquamation) | Radiation damages rapidly dividing basal keratinocytes → inflammation → skin breakdown | During and immediately after RT |
| **Chronic skin changes** (fibrosis, telangiectasia) | Radiation damages dermal fibroblasts and small vessels → progressive fibrosis and vascular damage | Months to years |
| **Breast oedema and pain** | Lymphatic damage → impaired drainage; fibrosis of breast tissue | Months |
| **Rib fractures** | Radiation-induced bone weakening of underlying ribs | Years |
| **Radiation pneumonitis** | Inflammation of underlying lung parenchyma within the radiation field | 1–6 months post-RT |
| **Cardiac toxicity** (especially left-sided breast RT) | Radiation to the left chest → exposure of the heart (particularly the LAD artery) → accelerated atherosclerosis, pericarditis | Years to decades |
| **Secondary malignancy** (angiosarcoma of irradiated breast) | Radiation-induced DNA damage in surviving cells → malignant transformation | 5–10+ years |

#### 2F. Complications of Dopamine Agonist Therapy (For Galactorrhoea/Prolactinoma)

| Drug | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Bromocriptine** | Nausea, vomiting, postural hypotension, headache | Dopamine agonism in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (nausea) and peripheral vasculature (hypotension) |
| **Cabergoline** | Nausea, headache; rarely cardiac valvulopathy (at high doses used in Parkinson's) | 5-HT2B receptor agonism on heart valves — at the low doses used for prolactinoma, this risk is minimal but should be monitored |
| Both | Impulse control disorders (rare) | Dopamine agonism in mesolimbic pathways |

---

### 3. Summary Table — Complications by Category

| Category | Key Complications |
|---|---|
| **Missed pathological discharge** | Progression of DCIS → invasive carcinoma; missed cancer |
| **Duct ectasia** | Periductal mastitis, breast abscess, nipple retraction |
| **Lactational mastitis** | Breast abscess (25%), sepsis, premature cessation of breastfeeding |
| **Periductal mastitis** | Subareolar abscess, periareolar fistula, recurrence, nipple retraction |
| **IGM** | Chronic sinuses, poor wound healing post-surgery, steroid rebound, misdiagnosis as cancer |
| **Microdochectomy / major duct excision** | Infection, haematoma, nipple necrosis, altered sensation, loss of breastfeeding ability, iatrogenic nipple inversion |
| **Mastectomy** | Seroma, skin flap necrosis, post-mastectomy pain, phantom breast, arm morbidity, frozen shoulder |
| **ALND** | Lymphoedema (10–20%), nerve injuries (4 nerves), seroma, Stewart-Treves syndrome |
| **Breast reconstruction** | TRAM: hernia; DIEP: flap failure; Implants: rupture, capsular contracture, BIA-ALCL |
| **Radiotherapy** | Skin reactions, fibrosis, pneumonitis, cardiac toxicity, secondary malignancy |
| **Dopamine agonists** | Nausea, postural hypotension, rarely cardiac valvulopathy |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications">

1. The most important complication of nipple discharge is **missed malignancy** — DCIS progresses to invasive carcinoma at ~1%/year. This is why all pathological discharge mandates triple assessment.

2. **Duct ectasia** complications: periductal mastitis → abscess → nipple retraction. It is a benign cascade but can mimic malignancy.

3. **Lactational mastitis** progresses to abscess in **25%** of cases. Abscess is often NOT fluctuant. Do NOT stop breastfeeding.

4. **Periareolar fistula** is the hallmark chronic complication of periductal mastitis — a communication between a subareolar duct and the skin. Requires fistulectomy ± total duct excision.

5. **IGM**: do NOT operate — slow wound healing. Steroid tapering causes rebound inflammation.

6. **Mastectomy complications**: seroma (most common), skin flap necrosis, post-mastectomy pain syndrome, phantom breast syndrome, arm morbidity.

7. **Four nerves at risk in ALND**: long thoracic (winged scapula), thoracodorsal (weak shoulder adduction/IR), medial pectoral (pec major weakness), intercostobrachial (paraesthesia of axilla/medial arm).

8. **Lymphoedema** after ALND occurs in up to **10–20%** of patients. Late complication: Stewart-Treves syndrome (lymphangiosarcoma).

9. **BIA-ALCL**: ALK-negative, CD30-positive T-cell lymphoma associated with textured implants. Capsulectomy is curative if confined to capsule.

10. **Capsular contracture**: most common implant complication long-term, especially post-infection or post-radiation.
