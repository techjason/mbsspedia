## Diagnostic Criteria, Diagnostic Algorithm, and Investigations for Infective (Pyogenic Flexor) Tenosynovitis

---

### 1. Diagnostic Criteria

PFT is fundamentally a **clinical diagnosis**. There is no single laboratory test or imaging study that confirms it — the diagnosis rests on recognising the clinical pattern at the bedside. This is why Kanavel's cardinal signs, described in 1912, remain the diagnostic gold standard over a century later.

#### 1.1 Kanavel's Cardinal Signs — The Diagnostic Criteria

***Kanavel's Cardinal Signs (described in 1912)*** [1]:

| # | Sign | Sensitivity / Specificity | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ***Tenderness over and limited to the flexor sheath*** | **Most sensitive** (~91–97%) | The entire synovial sheath is inflamed and distended with pus → pressure on any point along the sheath (from the distal palmar crease to the fingertip) elicits pain. Tenderness being *limited to* the sheath (not diffusely spread) helps localise the infection |
| 2 | ***Symmetrical enlargement of the digit ("fusiform")*** | Sensitive but less specific | Pus fills the sheath uniformly along its length → the finger swells symmetrically like a sausage/spindle. Other causes of sausage digit (dactylitis, cellulitis) reduce specificity |
| 3 | ***Severe pain on passive extension of the finger (greater proximally)*** | **Most specific** (~97%) | Passive extension stretches the inflamed, tense sheath and increases intra-sheath pressure. Pain is *greater proximally* because the proximal sheath is where pus tends to pool (gravity + anatomy of the cul-de-sac). This sign is rarely positive in non-sheath infections |
| 4 | ***Flexed posture of the involved digit*** | Moderately sensitive | The sheath accommodates maximal volume when the finger is in slight flexion (the sheath is lax). Extension would compress the sheath → the patient instinctively holds the finger flexed to minimise pain. Also contributed to by flexor spasm |

<Callout title="How Many Kanavel Signs Do You Need?">

The lecture slides present a clear threshold [1]:

- ***1–2 Kanavel signs + mild clinical symptoms + early infection*** → **Low clinical suspicion** → Trial of non-operative management
- ***3–4 Kanavel signs + moderate/severe symptoms*** → **High clinical suspicion** → **Surgical emergency** — proceed to operative treatment

**In practice**: if even **2 signs are present in the right clinical context** (e.g., penetrating wound + immunocompromised), maintain a very low threshold for surgery. The signs may not all be present early in the disease course. The key principle is that ***prompt clinical diagnosis*** is essential [1] — waiting for all 4 signs to develop risks tendon necrosis.
</Callout>

#### 1.2 Why Is This a Clinical Diagnosis?

Let's think about this from first principles:

- The flexor tendon sheath is a **tiny, deep structure** — you cannot aspirate it reliably at the bedside (unlike a knee joint in septic arthritis)
- Imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, MRI) can support the diagnosis but none are sensitive or specific enough to confirm or exclude PFT definitively in the acute setting
- **Blood tests** (WCC, CRP) are non-specific — they tell you there is infection *somewhere* but not *where*
- Microbiological confirmation (culture from sheath aspirate or intraoperative samples) comes **after** treatment has begun

Therefore, the clinical decision to operate is made **before** investigations return. Investigations serve to:
1. **Support** the clinical diagnosis
2. **Exclude differentials** (fracture, gout, foreign body)
3. **Guide antibiotic therapy** (culture & sensitivity)
4. **Assess for complications** (osteomyelitis, deep space infection)
5. **Risk-stratify** the patient (DM, renal failure, immunosuppression)

<Callout title="Exam Principle" type="error">
Never delay surgical treatment of PFT while waiting for investigation results. ***Prompt clinical diagnosis*** [1] and treatment takes priority. Investigations are supportive, not gate-keeping.
</Callout>

### 2. Diagnostic Algorithm

The following algorithm integrates the clinical assessment with investigation findings and the ***management protocol flow chart*** from the lecture [1]:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Patient presents with painful, swollen finger<br/>± history of penetrating trauma"] --> B["Focused History:<br/>Mechanism of injury, timing, comorbidities<br/>DM, renal failure, immunosuppression"]
    B --> C["Clinical Examination:<br/>Assess Kanavel Cardinal Signs"]
    C --> D{"How many Kanavel signs?"}
    
    D -->|"1-2 signs,<br/>mild symptoms,<br/>early infection"| E["LOW clinical suspicion for PFT"]
    D -->|"3-4 signs,<br/>moderate/severe symptoms"| F["HIGH clinical suspicion for PFT"]
    
    E --> G["Order investigations:<br/>Bloods, X-ray, wound swab"]
    G --> H["Start empirical IV antibiotics<br/>Elevate hand, splint"]
    H --> I["Examine affected hand frequently"]
    I --> J{"Improvement<br/>within 24 hours?"}
    J -->|Yes| K["Continue non-surgical treatment<br/>Complete antibiotic course"]
    J -->|No| L["Proceed to SURGERY"]
    
    F --> M["Order investigations concurrently<br/>Do NOT delay surgery"]
    M --> N["Start empirical IV antibiotics<br/>+ Book emergency theatre"]
    N --> O{"Evidence of advanced infection,<br/>necrosis, or chronic infection?"}
    O -->|No| P["Closed catheter irrigation<br/>and debridement"]
    O -->|Yes| Q["Open irrigation<br/>and debridement"]
    
    P --> R["Intraoperative samples:<br/>Gram stain, C/ST, AFB, tissue biopsy"]
    Q --> R
    R --> S["Tailor antibiotics to<br/>culture and sensitivity results"]
```

<Callout title="Key Decision Points from Lecture" type="idea">

***Non-operative treatment is indicated when:*** [1]
- ***Early presentation, within 48 hours after injury***
- ***Antibiotics started***
- ***Examine the affected hand frequently***
- ***No improvement after 24 to 48 hours → surgery is indicated***

This means non-operative management is only a **monitored trial** — you must reassess regularly and have a very low threshold to escalate to surgery.
</Callout>

### 3. Investigation Modalities

Investigations are organised into **bedside**, **blood tests**, **imaging**, and **microbiological** categories. For each, I'll explain *what* you're looking for, *why* it's relevant, and *how* to interpret the findings.

---

#### 3.1 Bedside Investigations

| Investigation | What to Look For | Why / Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **Vital signs** | Fever (temperature > 38°C), tachycardia, hypotension | Systemic inflammatory response. Fever supports infective aetiology. Hypotension + tachycardia → concern for sepsis (especially if necrotizing fasciitis or horseshoe abscess) |
| **Wound inspection** | Site, size, depth of any puncture wound; foreign body; discharge | Identifies the **portal of entry**. Purulent discharge from the wound confirms infection. A retained foreign body (thorn, fish bone) may be visible or palpable |
| **Capillary refill time and perfusion** | Prolonged CRT, mottling, pallor of the digit | Vascular compromise — may indicate compartment-like pressure in the sheath, or concurrent peripheral vascular disease |
| **Neurovascular status of the digit** | Sensation (two-point discrimination), motor function, digital Allen's test | Baseline neurovascular assessment before surgery. Also assesses whether digital nerve/artery is compromised by swelling |
| **Blood glucose** (point-of-care) | Hyperglycaemia | Undiagnosed or poorly controlled DM — a major risk factor for poor outcomes and ***amputation*** [1]. Needs aggressive glycaemic control |

---

#### 3.2 Blood Investigations

***Investigations include CBP, ESR, CRP*** [1] (discussed in the context of septic arthritis, but equally applicable to PFT):

| Test | Expected Findings in PFT | Why / Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| ***Complete blood picture (CBP)*** | **Leucocytosis** with **neutrophilia** (left shift) | Acute bacterial infection stimulates bone marrow neutrophil release. A normal WCC does **not** exclude PFT (can be normal early, or in immunosuppressed patients). A very high WCC ( > 15,000) with bandaemia suggests severe/systemic infection |
| ***Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)*** | Elevated (often > 30 mm/hr) | Non-specific marker of inflammation. Rises slowly (over days). More useful for monitoring treatment response over time than for acute diagnosis |
| ***C-reactive protein (CRP)*** | Elevated (often > 50 mg/L) | Acute phase reactant synthesised by the liver in response to IL-6. Rises within 6–8 hours of infection onset and peaks at 48 hours. More responsive than ESR for acute infection. Serial CRP is useful for monitoring treatment response — a falling CRP suggests improving infection |
| **Blood cultures** (aerobic + anaerobic) | May be positive (especially in bacteraemia/sepsis) | Should be taken **before** starting antibiotics. Positive in ~10–20% of PFT cases. More likely positive if systemically unwell. Identifies the organism and guides targeted antibiotic therapy. ***Blood for C/ST (50% positive in osteomyelitis)*** [4] — yield is lower in PFT but still important |
| **Renal function (U&E, creatinine)** | Elevated creatinine → ***renal failure*** is a risk factor for ***amputation*** [1] | Assesses comorbidity. Also needed for antibiotic dosing (many antibiotics are renally cleared). Acute kidney injury may indicate sepsis |
| **Liver function tests** | Deranged in liver disease / cirrhosis | Liver disease predisposes to *Vibrio vulnificus* infection — relevant in Hong Kong. Also affects drug metabolism |
| **HbA1c** | > 6.5% indicates diabetes | Identifies undiagnosed DM or assesses chronic glycaemic control in known diabetics. ***DM present in 57% of necrotizing fasciitis patients*** [1] — similarly important in PFT |
| **Blood glucose** | Hyperglycaemia | Acute stress response and/or uncontrolled DM |
| **Uric acid + joint aspirate microscopy** (if DDx gout) | Elevated uric acid; negatively birefringent crystals on polarised microscopy | To exclude crystal arthropathy as a differential. Remember: hyperuricaemia alone does not confirm gout — crystal identification is required |
| **Procalcitonin** (if available) | Elevated in bacterial infection | More specific for bacterial infection than CRP. Helps differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial inflammation. Not universally available |

<Callout title="Interpreting Normal Bloods" type="error">
A **normal WCC and CRP do NOT exclude PFT**, especially in:
- **Early infection** (within first 24 hours — CRP hasn't peaked yet)
- **Immunosuppressed patients** (unable to mount an adequate inflammatory response)
- **Elderly patients** (blunted inflammatory response)

If the clinical picture fits (Kanavel signs present), **treat the patient, not the blood test**.
</Callout>

#### 3.3 Imaging Investigations

***Describe the radiological features associated with MSS infections*** is a stated learning outcome [1].

| Modality | What to Look For | Why / Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| ***X-ray of the affected hand (AP and lateral)*** | **Soft tissue swelling** (fusiform along the digit); **foreign body** (radiopaque material — glass, metal, gravel); **subcutaneous gas** (suggests gas gangrene or necrotizing fasciitis); **fracture** (if trauma); **periarticular osteopenia / joint space changes** (if coexistent septic arthritis or osteomyelitis) | X-ray is the **first-line imaging** — fast, cheap, widely available. Its main role in PFT is to **exclude other diagnoses** (fracture, foreign body, gas gangrene) and **detect complications** (osteomyelitis). ***X-ray: normal in acute osteomyelitis*** [4] — so a normal X-ray does NOT exclude bony involvement. ***Linear streak of gas*** on X-ray suggests gas gangrene [4]. In septic arthritis: ***joint space effusion, periarticular osteopenia*** [4] |
| **Ultrasound (USS) of the tendon sheath** | **Fluid within the tendon sheath** (anechoic or hypoechoic collection surrounding the tendon); **thickened synovial sheath**; **peritendinous oedema**; **foreign body** (even non-radiopaque ones like wood, thorns) | USS is **excellent for detecting fluid in the tendon sheath** — a distended sheath with echogenic fluid (pus) is highly suggestive. It can also identify foreign bodies missed on X-ray. **Limitations**: operator-dependent, cannot differentiate sterile from infected fluid. Best used as a **bedside adjunct** to clinical examination. Can also guide **aspiration** of the sheath if attempted |
| ***MRI of the hand*** | **Fluid signal within the tendon sheath** (T2 hyperintense); **synovial sheath enhancement** (post-gadolinium); **peritendinous oedema**; **adjacent soft tissue infection** (deep space abscess); **osteomyelitis** (bone marrow oedema) | ***MRI: useful to detect any co-existent osteomyelitis — not routine*** [1]. MRI is the **most sensitive and specific imaging modality** for PFT and its complications. It beautifully shows the anatomical extent of infection — critical for surgical planning. However, it is **time-consuming** (30–60 minutes), **expensive**, and **not available emergently** in most centres. Therefore, it is reserved for: (a) diagnostic uncertainty, (b) suspected complications (osteomyelitis, deep space infection), (c) chronic/atypical presentations (*M. marinum*). **Do NOT delay surgery** to obtain an MRI |
| **CT scan** | Soft tissue collections, gas, bony involvement | Less useful than MRI for soft tissue detail. May be used if MRI is unavailable or to look for **gas in deep tissues** (necrotizing fasciitis). ***CT with contrast for deep/organ space infection: rim-enhancing collection*** [5] |

> **Summary of Imaging Hierarchy in PFT:**
> 1. **X-ray** → first line (exclude fracture, foreign body, gas)
> 2. **Ultrasound** → bedside adjunct (detect sheath fluid, foreign body)
> 3. **MRI** → gold standard for soft tissue detail but NOT routine and NOT for acute decision-making
> 4. **CT** → rarely needed; consider if necrotizing fasciitis suspected

---

#### 3.4 Microbiological Investigations

These are the investigations that **guide targeted antibiotic therapy**. Think of them in two stages: **pre-operative** and **intra-operative**.

##### Pre-operative Samples

| Sample | Tests Ordered | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **Wound swab / pus from the entry wound** | Gram stain, culture and sensitivity (C/ST), AFB smear (if chronic/atypical) | ***Wound swab/pus for culture*** [5] — take from the wound itself, **avoid the wound edge** (contamination with skin flora) [5]. Gram stain gives a rapid (< 1 hour) guide to organism morphology (Gram-positive cocci in clusters → *Staph*; Gram-positive cocci in chains → *Strep*; Gram-negative rods → enteric organisms). Culture and sensitivity takes 24–48 hours but gives definitive identification and antibiogram |
| **Blood cultures** (x2 sets, aerobic + anaerobic) | C/ST | Take **before** starting antibiotics. Two sets from different venepuncture sites to reduce contamination. Positive in ~10–20% of PFT; higher yield if systemically septic |
| **Swabs for specific pathogens** (if clinically indicated) | Gonococcal NAAT (genital/rectal/pharyngeal); AFB smear and *Mycobacterium* culture (if chronic/marine exposure) | If DGI suspected: NAAT more sensitive than culture. If *M. marinum* suspected: **warn the lab** — requires **prolonged incubation at 30–32°C** (lower than standard 37°C), otherwise will be missed |

##### Intra-operative Samples (taken during surgical irrigation/debridement)

| Sample | Tests Ordered | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **Sheath fluid / pus aspirate** | Gram stain, C/ST (aerobic + anaerobic + fungal), AFB smear and culture | This is the **most important microbiological sample** — direct from the site of infection, highest yield. Gram stain guides initial empirical therapy refinement |
| **Tissue biopsy** (synovial sheath wall) | Histopathology (H&E, Ziehl-Neelsen, PAS/GMS for fungi), tissue culture (bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal) | Essential if **chronic/granulomatous** infection suspected (*M. marinum*, TB, fungal). Histopathology shows granulomatous inflammation with caseation (TB) or non-caseating granulomas (*M. marinum*). Tissue culture is more sensitive than swab culture for atypical mycobacteria |
| **Foreign body** (if found) | Send for culture | A retained foreign body (thorn, fish bone) may harbour organisms |

<Callout title="Lab Communication for Atypical Organisms" type="idea">
If you suspect ***Mycobacterium marinum*** (marine injury, chronic indolent course), you **must** explicitly communicate this to the microbiology lab. Standard culture protocols incubate at 37°C, but *M. marinum* grows optimally at **30–32°C** and requires **prolonged incubation (up to 6–8 weeks)**. If you don't alert the lab, the culture will be falsely reported as negative.

Similarly, for ***Neisseria gonorrhoeae***, request specific **chocolate agar** or **NAAT** — the organism is fastidious and will not grow on routine media.
</Callout>

#### 3.5 Investigations for Differentials (When Diagnosis Is Uncertain)

| Differential Being Considered | Additional Investigation | Key Finding |
|---|---|---|
| **Septic arthritis** | ***Joint aspiration: Gram stain, culture, crystal, glucose*** [1] | ***WCC > 50,000/mm³, > 75% PMN, positive Gram stain (60–80%)*** for bacterial (non-gonococcal) septic arthritis [1]. Low glucose ( < 50% of serum glucose) |
| **Gout / pseudogout** | Joint aspirate with **polarised microscopy** | Negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals (monosodium urate = gout); positively birefringent rhomboid crystals (calcium pyrophosphate = pseudogout) |
| **Necrotizing fasciitis** | ***LRINEC score*** [4]; ***bedside finger probe test*** [1] | ***LRINEC > 8 = high risk*** [4]. Components: CRP, Hb, WCC, sodium, creatinine, glucose. ***Finger probe test: lack of bleeding, foul smelling dishwater pus, minimal tissue resistance to finger dissection*** [1] |
| **Osteomyelitis** | X-ray (may be normal acutely); ***MRI: best in diagnosis*** [4] | ***X-ray: periosteal reaction, sclerosis in chronic; normal in acute*** [4]. MRI: bone marrow oedema, periosteal enhancement |
| **Foreign body** | X-ray (radiopaque); USS (non-radiopaque) | Radiopaque on X-ray: metal, glass. Non-radiopaque on USS: wood, thorn, plastic — appear as hyperechoic foci with posterior acoustic shadowing |
| **Fracture** | X-ray hand (AP + lateral + oblique) | Fracture line, cortical discontinuity, displacement |
| **Herpetic whitlow** | Viral PCR / Tzanck smear | Multinucleated giant cells on Tzanck; HSV PCR positive |

---

### 4. Interpretation Framework: Putting It All Together

When you receive investigation results, interpret them in the context of the clinical picture:

| Scenario | Bloods | X-ray | USS | Clinical | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Classic acute PFT** | WCC ↑, CRP ↑ | Soft tissue swelling, no fracture | Fluid in tendon sheath | 3–4 Kanavel signs | Confirmed PFT → emergency surgery |
| **Early PFT** | Normal or mildly ↑ | Normal or mild soft tissue swelling | May show early fluid | 1–2 Kanavel signs | Possible early PFT → antibiotics + close monitoring |
| **PFT with osteomyelitis** | WCC ↑↑, CRP ↑↑, ESR ↑↑ | Periosteal reaction (if chronic) | Fluid in sheath + periosteal changes | Severe, late presentation | Complicated PFT → open debridement + prolonged antibiotics |
| **Chronic granulomatous** | WCC normal, ESR mildly ↑ | Normal or lytic bone changes | Thickened sheath, complex fluid | Indolent sausage digit, marine exposure | Suspect *M. marinum* → tissue biopsy + special cultures |
| **Necrotizing fasciitis** | WCC ↑↑, CRP ↑↑↑, Na ↓, Cr ↑ | Gas in soft tissues | Deep fluid, fascial oedema | ***Pain out of proportion, haemorrhagic bullae, systemic toxicity*** [1] [4] | Emergency → aggressive debridement |

| **Imaging** | USS tendon sheath | Detect sheath fluid, foreign body | Bedside adjunct |
| **Imaging** | MRI (***not routine*** [1]) | Detect osteomyelitis, deep space infection | If diagnostic uncertainty or complications suspected |
| **Microbiology** | Wound swab / pus for C/ST | Identify organism | Pre-operative |
| **Microbiology** | Intra-op sheath fluid + tissue biopsy | Gold standard microbiological sample | During surgery |
| **Special** | Joint aspirate (if DDx septic arthritis) | ***Gram stain, culture, crystal, glucose*** [1] | If joint involvement suspected |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Diagnosis of PFT — Key Takeaways:**

1. **PFT is a CLINICAL diagnosis** based on ***Kanavel's 4 cardinal signs*** [1] — no investigation can replace bedside assessment
2. **Most sensitive sign**: tenderness along the entire flexor sheath; **Most specific sign**: pain on passive extension
3. **Threshold for surgery**: ***3–4 Kanavel signs → surgical emergency***; ***1–2 signs → trial of antibiotics with reassessment at 24 hours*** [1]
4. **Investigations are supportive, not gate-keeping** — ***prompt clinical diagnosis*** [1] takes priority
5. **First-line imaging**: X-ray (exclude fracture, foreign body, gas); USS (detect sheath fluid); ***MRI is not routine*** but best for complications [1]
6. **Bloods**: ***CBP, ESR, CRP*** [1] + blood cultures before antibiotics + renal function + glucose/HbA1c
7. **Gold standard microbiology**: intra-operative sheath fluid and tissue biopsy sent for Gram stain, C/ST (aerobic, anaerobic, AFB, fungal)
8. **Alert the lab** if you suspect *M. marinum* (30–32°C incubation) or *N. gonorrhoeae* (chocolate agar / NAAT)
9. **Normal bloods do NOT exclude PFT** — treat the patient, not the blood test
