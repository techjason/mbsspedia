## Differential Diagnosis of Infective (Pyogenic Flexor) Tenosynovitis

The differential diagnosis of a swollen, painful finger is broader than you might think. The key clinical challenge is distinguishing **pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis (PFT)** — a surgical emergency — from conditions that can mimic it. Let's work through this systematically, grouping differentials by anatomical location and pathological process, and explaining *why* each condition can be confused with PFT and *how* to tell them apart.

---

### Guiding Principle: What Makes PFT Unique?

Before diving into differentials, recall what defines PFT clinically — the **4 Kanavel signs** [1]:

1. ***Fusiform (symmetrical) swelling of the entire finger***
2. ***Flexed posture of the involved digit***
3. ***Tenderness over and limited to the flexor sheath***
4. ***Severe pain on passive extension of the finger (especially proximally)***

Any condition that causes a swollen, painful, stiff finger can mimic PFT. The differentials can be organised by the **TIN** framework (Trauma, Infection, Neoplasm) plus Inflammatory, Metabolic, Degenerative, and Vascular categories [3].

### Differential Diagnosis Table

| Differential | Why It Mimics PFT | How to Distinguish from PFT |
|---|---|---|
| **Felon (pulp space abscess)** | Painful, swollen fingertip; may coexist with or spread to cause PFT | Swelling and tenderness **confined to the distal pulp** (volar pad of fingertip), not along the entire flexor sheath. No fusiform swelling of the whole digit. No pain on passive extension of PIPJ/MCPJ. The pulp is a **separate closed compartment** (septae of Grayson's ligaments) distinct from the tendon sheath |
| **Paronychia** | Painful, swollen periungual area; can spread contiguously to cause PFT | Swelling and erythema **localised to the nail fold** (lateral or proximal). Pus may be visible under the cuticle. No tenderness along the proximal flexor sheath. No flexed posture |
| **Herpetic whitlow** | Painful vesicular lesion on the fingertip; can be mistaken for a felon or early PFT | **Grouped vesicles** on an erythematous base on the fingertip. Viral prodrome (tingling/burning). Often in healthcare workers (HSV exposure). **Do NOT incise** — will spread the virus. Tzanck smear or viral PCR confirms |
| ***Septic arthritis*** **of PIPJ, DIPJ, or MCPJ** | Hot, swollen, painful joint; limited ROM; fever | Pain and swelling **localised to one joint**, not along the entire sheath. Tenderness is **periarticular**, not along the whole flexor sheath. ***Hot, swollen, tender joint; patient holds joint in flexion; gross limitation of motion*** [1]. Joint aspiration: ***WBC > 50,000/mm³, > 75% PMN, positive Gram stain (60–80%)*** [1]. Can coexist with PFT (contiguous spread) |
| **Subcutaneous abscess / cellulitis of the finger** | Red, swollen, painful finger | Cellulitis: **diffuse erythema** with ill-defined borders, warmth, but **no fusiform swelling along the sheath** and **no pain on passive extension**. Abscess: **focal fluctuant collection**, not tracking along the tendon sheath. Tenderness is superficial and not limited to the flexor sheath pathway |
| **Gout / pseudogout (crystal arthropathy)** | Acute monoarthritis of a finger joint — exquisitely painful, red, swollen | Usually affects **one joint** (MCPJ, PIPJ, or 1st MTPJ in foot). History of prior attacks, tophi, elevated urate. Joint aspirate: **negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals** (gout) or **positively birefringent rhomboid crystals** (pseudogout). No tenderness along the entire flexor sheath |
| **Trigger finger (stenosing tenovaginitis of A1 pulley)** [2] | Finger locked in flexion — mimics the "flexed posture" Kanavel sign | ***Clicking or locking*** in flexion at the **A1 pulley level** (over MCPJ), **not** along the entire sheath. **No signs of infection** (no fever, no erythema, no warmth). Tenderness is **focal** over the A1 pulley only, not fusiform. **Chronic** and **mechanical**, not acute and infective. Green's classification grades I–IV [2] |
| **De Quervain's tenosynovitis** [2] | Painful tendon sheath pathology; the word "tenosynovitis" itself causes confusion | This is a **non-infective, stenosing tenovaginitis** of the **1st extensor compartment** (APL & EPB) on the **dorsal/radial side of the wrist**, not the flexor sheath of a digit [2]. Positive **Finkelstein's test** [2]. No fever, no fusiform digital swelling |
| **Flexor tendon injury / rupture** | Pain, swelling, inability to flex the finger | History of **acute laceration or forced extension** injury. Inability to actively flex DIP (FDP injury) or PIP (FDS injury). No signs of infection acutely. Tenodesis effect absent for the ruptured tendon |
| **Fracture of phalanx** | Pain, swelling, inability to move the finger; may have flexed posture due to pain | History of **direct trauma**. **Point tenderness over bone**, not along the flexor sheath. Deformity, crepitus may be present. **X-ray** will show fracture line. No systemic infective features |
| **Dislocation of PIPJ or DIPJ** | Painful, swollen, deformed finger held in abnormal position | Obvious **deformity** at the joint. History of hyperextension or axial loading injury. Reducible. X-ray diagnostic |
| ***Necrotizing fasciitis*** | Severe pain, swelling, systemic toxicity — can start in the hand | ***Pain out of proportion to clinical signs; haemorrhagic bullae; dirty "dishwater" discharge; systemic toxicity*** [1] [4]. Rapidly progressive. Skin changes (dusky, necrotic) evolve faster than PFT. ***Finger probe test positive*** (minimal resistance to blunt dissection through fascial planes) [4]. ***LRINEC score > 8 = high risk*** [4]. This is a **life-threatening emergency** |
| ***Osteomyelitis*** **of phalanx** | Chronic painful swollen finger with limited ROM | Usually ***insidious*** onset (unless acute haematogenous). ***Draining sinus tract*** may be present in chronic cases [4]. **X-ray**: periosteal reaction, lytic lesions (may be normal in acute phase). **MRI** is best for diagnosis [4]. Can coexist with PFT (contiguous spread from tendon sheath to bone) |
| **Ganglion cyst** [2] | Swelling on the finger or wrist | ***Solitary spherical painless smooth cystic lesion; transilluminable*** [2]. **Non-tender**, no signs of infection. Chronic, not acute. Located at joint capsule or tendon sheath but does not cause fusiform swelling of the entire digit |
| **Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI)** | Tenosynovitis (often multiple tendons) + arthritis | Young sexually active patient. **Polytenosynovitis** (multiple tendons of wrists/ankles/fingers — not isolated to one digit). **Migratory polyarthralgia**. **Dermatitis** (scattered painless pustules on trunk/extremities). Blood/genital NAAT positive. Joint aspirate often culture-negative |
| **Gout tophi / rheumatoid nodule** | Chronic nodular swelling near finger joints | Non-tender (unless flaring), **chronic**, no acute infective features. Tophi: chalky white deposits. RA nodules: firm subcutaneous nodules at pressure points |
| **Foreign body reaction / retained foreign body** | Painful swollen finger after penetrating injury | History of penetrating trauma (same as PFT!). May have a **palpable foreign body**. X-ray may show radiopaque material (glass, metal). If foreign body is within the tendon sheath, it can *cause* secondary PFT — so these coexist. Ultrasound helps identify non-radiopaque foreign bodies |

### Key Differentiating Features — The "Discriminators"

When you're standing at the bedside trying to decide if this is PFT or something else, focus on these discriminators:

| Feature | PFT | Felon | Paronychia | Cellulitis | Septic arthritis | Necrotizing fasciitis |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Distribution of swelling** | **Entire digit** (fusiform) | Distal pulp only | Nail fold only | Diffuse, ill-defined | Periarticular, one joint | May extend beyond digit |
| **Tenderness distribution** | **Along entire flexor sheath** | Distal pulp | Periungual | Diffuse, superficial | Periarticular | Deep, out of proportion |
| **Pain on passive extension** | **Yes — severe** | No | No | Minimal | Yes (at affected joint only) | Yes but diffuse |
| **Flexed posture** | **Yes** | No | No | No | Yes (at one joint) | Variable |
| **Skin changes** | Erythema | Tense pulp | Erythema at nail fold | Spreading erythema | Erythema over joint | ***Haemorrhagic bullae***, dusky skin, necrosis [4] |
| **Systemic toxicity** | Moderate (late) | Mild | Mild | Moderate | Moderate | ***Severe, early*** [4] |
| **Speed of progression** | Hours to days | Days | Days | Days | Hours to days | ***Hours — rapidly progressive*** [4] |

<Callout title="The Critical 'Do Not Miss' Diagnoses" type="error">

When evaluating a swollen painful finger/hand, the three diagnoses you **cannot miss** because of devastating consequences are [1]:

1. ***Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis*** → tendon necrosis, stiff finger, amputation
2. ***Septic arthritis*** → joint destruction
3. ***Necrotizing fasciitis*** → limb loss, death

All three require ***early recognition*** and ***early surgical intervention + empirical antibiotics*** [1]. If in doubt, treat as the most dangerous diagnosis first.

### Approach to Narrowing the Differential

**Step 1: Is this infective or non-infective?**
- Infective: fever, wound/portal of entry, leucocytosis, elevated CRP, rapid onset
- Non-infective: chronic/mechanical symptoms, no systemic features (trigger finger, De Quervain's, ganglion)

**Step 2: If infective — where exactly is the infection?**
- **Tendon sheath** → PFT (fusiform swelling, all 4 Kanavel signs)
- **Joint** → Septic arthritis (periarticular swelling, pain with any joint movement, aspiration diagnostic)
- **Pulp** → Felon (focal distal swelling)
- **Nail fold** → Paronychia
- **Subcutaneous tissue** → Cellulitis/abscess
- **Fascia/deep planes** → Necrotizing fasciitis (pain out of proportion, systemic toxicity, skin necrosis)
- **Bone** → Osteomyelitis (usually subacute/chronic unless haematogenous)

**Step 3: If the whole finger is swollen ("sausage digit"), think of:**

| Acute | Chronic |
|---|---|
| PFT (infective) | Psoriatic dactylitis (inflammatory) |
| Septic arthritis (may overlap) | Reactive arthritis (Reiter's) |
| Gout flare | Sarcoidosis |
| Fracture with haematoma | TB dactylitis (spina ventosa) |
| | Sickle cell dactylitis (children) |

The **acute sausage digit with Kanavel signs + a wound** is PFT until proven otherwise.

**Step 4: Check for coexisting/evolving pathology**
- PFT can **arise from** a felon or paronychia (contiguous spread)
- PFT can **progress to** septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, deep space infection, or necrotizing fasciitis
- Always examine for **proximal spread** (palm, wrist, forearm) — suggests horseshoe abscess or deep space involvement

<Callout title="Practical Tip" type="idea">
In the exam or clinical setting, if you're given a scenario of a painful swollen finger after a penetrating injury and you can identify **tenderness along the entire flexor sheath + pain on passive extension**, that is essentially pathognomonic for PFT. The other conditions do not produce this combination. State the diagnosis confidently — don't hedge with a long differential when the Kanavel signs are clearly present.

### Special DDx Scenarios Worth Knowing

#### PFT vs Cellulitis
This is the commonest clinical dilemma. Both cause a red, swollen, painful finger after a wound. The key is that in cellulitis, the inflammation is **in the subcutaneous tissue**, not the tendon sheath. So:
- Cellulitis: erythema is **superficial and spreading**, tenderness is **diffuse** (not along the sheath), **no pain on passive extension**, **no fusiform swelling** (irregular swelling instead), **no flexed posture**
- PFT: tenderness **tracks along the sheath** from palm to fingertip, **pain on passive extension is marked**

#### PFT vs Gout Flare (Podagra of the Hand)
An acute gout attack at the MCPJ or PIPJ can produce a red, swollen, exquisitely tender finger. However:
- Gout: periarticular swelling at **one joint**, not fusiform along the entire digit. History of prior attacks, hyperuricaemia, tophi. Joint aspiration with **polarised microscopy** showing negatively birefringent urate crystals is diagnostic [4]
- PFT: tenderness along the **entire** sheath, not limited to one joint

#### PFT vs Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI)
DGI can cause tenosynovitis, but it is characteristically **polytenosynovitis** (multiple tendons, often wrists and ankles, not just one finger). Associated features include migratory polyarthralgia and a characteristic **dermatitis** (scattered painless pustules). The patient is typically young and sexually active.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Differential Diagnosis of Infective Tenosynovitis — Key Takeaways:**

1. The **4 Kanavel signs** are the primary discriminators — no other condition produces all four simultaneously
2. **Pain on passive extension** (most specific) and **tenderness along the entire flexor sheath** (most sensitive) are the best signs to distinguish PFT from other finger infections
3. **Three "cannot miss" diagnoses** in a painful swollen hand: ***PFT, septic arthritis, necrotizing fasciitis*** — all require emergency surgical intervention [1]
4. Commonest diagnostic dilemma is **PFT vs cellulitis** — look for sheath-specific signs (fusiform swelling, flexed posture, pain on passive extension)
5. **Sausage digit** has a broad differential (PFT, dactylitis, gout) — acute onset + wound + Kanavel signs = PFT
6. PFT can **coexist with or evolve from/into** adjacent infections (felon → PFT → septic arthritis → osteomyelitis → deep space infection)
7. ***Necrotizing fasciitis***: pain out of proportion, haemorrhagic bullae, systemic toxicity, dishwater pus, LRINEC > 8 [1] [4]
