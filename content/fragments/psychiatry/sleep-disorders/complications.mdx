## Complications of Sleep Disorders

### Guiding Principle

Sleep is not a luxury — it is a biological necessity. When sleep is chronically disrupted, the consequences cascade across virtually every organ system. The complications of sleep disorders can be understood from first principles by recognising that sleep serves **restorative, metabolic, immunological, neuroplastic, and hormonal** functions. Disrupt any of these, and disease follows.

The complications can be categorised into:
1. **Direct consequences of the sleep disorder itself** (e.g., injury from parasomnias, accidents from EDS)
2. **Systemic complications of chronic sleep disruption** (shared across many sleep disorders — cardiovascular, metabolic, neuropsychiatric, immunological)
3. **Disorder-specific complications** (e.g., neurodegenerative conversion in RBD, augmentation in RLS)
4. **Iatrogenic complications** (adverse effects of treatments — medications, CPAP)

### 1. Systemic Complications of Chronic Sleep Disruption

These complications are shared across insomnia, OSA, narcolepsy, shift work disorder, and any condition causing chronic sleep loss. They represent the downstream effects of sustained physiological stress from inadequate or fragmented sleep.

#### 1.1 Cardiovascular Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiological Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Hypertension** | Chronic sleep deprivation → ***↑ sympathetic nervous (SN) activity*** [2] → sustained elevation of catecholamines → peripheral vasoconstriction → ↑ SVR → HTN. In OSA specifically: repetitive apnoeas cause cyclical hypoxia–reoxygenation → chemoreceptor sensitisation → persistent sympathetic overdrive that continues even during the daytime. OSA is the leading secondary cause of resistant HTN. |
| **Coronary artery disease and MI** | ***Chronic effect: associated with ↑ overall mortality*** [2]. Chronic sympathetic overdrive → endothelial dysfunction → ↑ inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, TNF-α) → accelerated atherosclerosis. Intermittent hypoxia (OSA) → oxidative stress → lipid peroxidation → foam cell formation in arterial walls. Sleep deprivation → ↑ evening cortisol → metabolic syndrome → further CVD risk. |
| **Heart failure** | OSA → chronic intermittent hypoxia + large negative intrathoracic pressure swings (Müller manoeuvre against closed glottis) → ↑ LV transmural pressure → ↑ afterload → LV hypertrophy → eventual failure. Also, sympathetic overdrive → direct myocardial toxicity over years. |
| **Arrhythmias (especially AF)** | OSA: each apnoeic episode causes vagal surge (hypoxia-mediated) → bradycardia → followed by sympathetic surge on arousal → tachycardia. This "autonomic seesaw" predisposes to atrial fibrillation, ventricular ectopy, and heart block. AF prevalence in severe OSA is ~5× that of the general population. |
| **Stroke** | Combination of HTN, atherosclerosis, AF (cardioembolic), and endothelial dysfunction. ***Partial sleep deprivation and short duration ( < 7h vs 7–8h) is associated with mental and physical health risk, especially cardiovascular*** [2]. Paradoxically, ***long duration ( > 9h) is also associated with health risks*** [2] — a U-shaped mortality curve. |
| ***↑ Heart rate variability*** | ***Increased heart rate variability*** [2] reflects autonomic dysregulation — loss of the normal circadian pattern of parasympathetic dominance during sleep. |

<Callout title="The U-Shaped Curve of Sleep Duration and Mortality">

***Partial sleep deprivation and short duration ( < 7h vs 7–8h) is associated with mental and physical health risk, especially CVS. Long duration ( > 9h) is also associated with health risks.*** [2]

Why the U-shape? Short sleep → the mechanisms described above (sympathetic overdrive, inflammation, metabolic dysfunction). Long sleep → may be a marker of underlying illness (depression, chronic inflammation, obesity, undiagnosed sleep disorders like OSA that fragment sleep leading to compensatory oversleeping), rather than long sleep being directly harmful. ***Sleep < 5h/day during weekends is associated with 52% ↑ mortality compared to 7h/day.*** [2]
</Callout>

#### 1.2 Metabolic Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiological Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Obesity*** | ***Chronic effect: associated with obesity*** [2]. Sleep deprivation → ↓ leptin (satiety hormone, produced by adipocytes during sleep) + ↑ ghrelin (hunger hormone, produced by stomach when awake) → net effect: ↑ appetite, particularly for calorie-dense carbohydrates. Also: fatigue → ↓ physical activity → ↓ energy expenditure. Sympathetic overdrive → cortisol excess → visceral fat deposition. |
| ***↓ Glucose tolerance / Type 2 Diabetes*** | ***Physiological: ↓ insulin response (→ ↓ glucose tolerance)*** [2]. Sleep deprivation → ↓ insulin sensitivity at the cellular level (mechanism: sympathetic activation → ↑ cortisol and catecholamines → counter-regulatory hormones oppose insulin action; also, direct ↓ pancreatic β-cell function). Even one week of sleep restriction (5–6 hours/night) in healthy adults shifts glucose tolerance to a pre-diabetic range. ***Risk of diabetes Type 2*** [2]. OSA: intermittent hypoxia independently impairs insulin signalling. |
| **Dyslipidaemia** | Sleep deprivation → ↑ cortisol → ↑ hepatic VLDL production → ↑ triglycerides, ↓ HDL. Insulin resistance further exacerbates dyslipidaemia. |
| **Metabolic syndrome** | The convergence of obesity + HTN + dyslipidaemia + insulin resistance. OSA is now considered an independent component of metabolic syndrome — some authors call the combination "Syndrome Z" (metabolic syndrome + OSA). |

#### 1.3 Neuropsychiatric Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiological Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Cognitive impairment*** | ***Brain: cognitive impairment, memory lapses or loss*** [2]. Sleep (especially SWS and REM) is essential for memory consolidation — hippocampal replay during SWS transfers episodic memories from hippocampus to neocortex. REM consolidates procedural and emotional memories. Chronic disruption → ↓ working memory, ↓ attention, ↓ executive function. |
| ***Irritability and emotional dysregulation*** | ***Neuropsychiatric: ↑ amygdala activation → ↑ negative emotions*** [2]. Sleep deprivation weakens prefrontal cortical inhibition of the amygdala → unchecked emotional reactivity. The medial prefrontal cortex normally provides top-down regulation of limbic responses; this regulatory pathway is impaired by even one night of poor sleep. |
| ***Impaired moral judgement*** | ***Impaired moral judgement*** [2]. The prefrontal cortex (especially ventromedial PFC) mediates moral reasoning. Sleep loss → prefrontal hypofunction → ↓ empathy, ↓ social judgement, ↓ ethical decision-making. |
| **Depression and anxiety** | ***Sleep disorders may be a cause of psychological symptoms → contribute to onset of psychiatric disorders*** [2]. Insomnia is a robust risk factor for incident depression (RR ~2–3×). The bidirectional relationship: insomnia → HPA dysregulation + amygdala hyperactivation + serotonergic pathway disruption → depression; depression → circadian disruption + hyperarousal → insomnia. Treating insomnia reduces depression risk and improves treatment outcomes in existing depression. |
| ***Hallucinations*** | ***Hallucinations*** [2]. Severe sleep deprivation ( > 72h) can cause visual and auditory hallucinations — effectively, REM-like intrusion phenomena into wakefulness (the brain begins generating dream content while still awake). This is a recognised phenomenon in sleep-deprived military personnel and medical residents. |
| ***Symptoms similar to ADHD*** | ***Symptoms similar to ADHD*** [2]. Sleep-deprived children and adults show inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity — mimicking ADHD. In children, sleep deprivation paradoxically causes hyperactivity rather than sleepiness (unlike adults). This has important clinical implications: always screen for sleep disorders before diagnosing ADHD in children. |

#### 1.4 Immunological Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Impaired immune system*** | ***Impaired immune system*** [2]. During SWS, the immune system is most active — pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-α) are released, natural killer (NK) cell activity peaks, and adaptive immune responses are consolidated. Sleep deprivation → ↓ NK cell activity, ↓ antibody response to vaccination (e.g., influenza and hepatitis B vaccine responses are significantly blunted by sleep restriction), ↑ susceptibility to infection (sleeping < 6h → 4.2× risk of catching the common cold vs > 7h). |
| **Chronic inflammation** | Chronic sleep loss → sustained low-grade inflammation (↑ CRP, IL-6, TNF-α) → contributes to atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, and possibly carcinogenesis. |

#### 1.5 Other Systemic Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Growth suppression*** | ***Growth suppression*** [2]. Growth hormone (GH) is predominantly secreted during SWS (especially the first SWS episode of the night). Chronic sleep deprivation in children → ↓ GH → growth retardation. |
| ***↓ Core body temperature*** | ***Decreased temperature*** [2]. Sleep deprivation disrupts normal thermoregulation — the circadian temperature nadir becomes less pronounced, and overall core body temperature may be lower during the day. |
| ***Tremors, aches*** | ***Tremors, aches*** [2]. Prolonged wakefulness → neuromuscular fatigue → fine tremor, myalgia. Also related to ↑ sympathetic tone and ↑ cortisol effects on muscle. |
| ***Severe yawning*** | ***Severe yawning*** [2]. The exact mechanism of yawning is debated, but it is a universal marker of sleepiness — possibly serves to ↑ cerebral blood flow or ↑ arousal through stretching of pharyngeal muscles. |

### 2. Complications Specific to Individual Sleep Disorders

#### 2.1 Insomnia — Specific Complications

| Complication | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Perpetuation and chronicity** | ***Chronic insomnia is notoriously persistent — lasts ≥1 year in 74%, ≥3 years in 46%, resolves in 54% but recurs in > 50% of those recovered within 4 years*** [2]. The perpetuating factors (3P model) become self-sustaining — maladaptive sleep behaviours and catastrophic cognitions about sleep become deeply ingrained habits. ***Exacerbation: often connected to medical, psychiatric, psychosocial stressors*** [2]. |
| **Development of psychiatric disorders** | Chronic insomnia is an independent risk factor for: major depression (RR ~2.5), anxiety disorders (RR ~2), substance use disorders (self-medication with alcohol, OTC sedatives, benzodiazepines), and suicidal ideation. ***Insomnia may be a cause of psychological symptoms → contribute to onset of psychiatric disorders*** [2]. |
| **Substance dependence** | Patients with chronic insomnia may self-medicate with alcohol (initial sedation, but ultimately worsens sleep), over-the-counter antihistamines, or escalate benzodiazepine use → dependence. The "cycle of worry" [2] drives patients to seek any solution, increasing vulnerability to substance misuse. |
| **Functional impairment** | ***Compromised daytime function: fatigue, malaise, ↓ concentration, ↓ work performance*** [2]. Chronic insomnia is associated with ↑ absenteeism, ↓ productivity (presenteeism), and ↑ healthcare utilisation — the economic burden is substantial. |
| ***↑ Cardiovascular mortality*** | Chronic insomnia with short objective sleep duration ( < 6h on PSG) is associated with ↑ all-cause mortality and ↑ CVS mortality — this "hyperarousal insomnia" phenotype carries the highest risk. |

#### 2.2 Obstructive Sleep Apnoea — Specific Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Resistant hypertension** | OSA is the most common secondary cause. Cyclical hypoxia → chemoreceptor sensitisation → persistent sympathetic overdrive. ↑ aldosterone secretion also contributes (OSA is associated with ↑ aldosterone levels). Treating OSA with CPAP ↓ BP by ~2–3 mmHg in compliant patients. |
| **Cor pulmonale** | Chronic intermittent hypoxia → pulmonary vasoconstriction (hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, same mechanism as in COPD) → pulmonary hypertension → right ventricular hypertrophy → right heart failure. |
| **Polycythaemia** | Chronic hypoxaemia → ↑ EPO secretion from kidney → ↑ red cell mass → ↑ blood viscosity → further ↑ risk of thrombosis and stroke. |
| ***Road traffic accidents (RTA)*** | ***Impact: RTA, work-related accidents, ↓ neuropsychological and motor function, ↓ QoL*** [2]. EDS from OSA → ↑ risk of drowsy driving. Untreated OSA patients have a 2–7× increased risk of RTA compared to the general population. This is one of the most important reasons to treat. |
| **Neurocognitive decline** | Chronic intermittent hypoxia → hippocampal and prefrontal cortical neuronal damage → progressive memory loss, executive dysfunction. OSA is now recognised as a modifiable risk factor for dementia. |
| **Perioperative risk** | Undiagnosed OSA ↑ risk during general anaesthesia — difficult intubation (obese, crowded airway), sensitivity to sedatives/opioids (further ↓ pharyngeal tone), post-operative respiratory complications. Always screen for OSA preoperatively. |
| **Nocturia** | ***Nocturia due to arousal and ↑ abdominal pressure*** [2]. During obstructive apnoeas, large negative intrathoracic pressure → ↑ venous return → atrial distension → ↑ ANP release → ↑ diuresis. Also, arousals → awareness of bladder fullness. Nocturia resolves with CPAP in many patients. |

#### 2.3 Narcolepsy — Specific Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Accidents and injuries** | Sleep attacks during driving, operating machinery, or cooking → RTA, burns, falls. ***Majority safe to drive but may need time limit*** [2]. |
| **Psychosocial impact** | Narcolepsy is profoundly disabling — falling asleep at work/school, cataplexy causing embarrassment, sleep paralysis causing fear. Depression affects ~25–50% of narcolepsy patients. Social isolation, unemployment, and relationship difficulties are common. |
| **Obesity** | Orexin regulates metabolism in addition to wakefulness. Orexin deficiency → ↓ basal metabolic rate + ↓ physical activity from sleepiness → weight gain. BMI is on average higher in narcolepsy type 1 patients than age-matched controls. |
| **Status cataplecticus** | Prolonged or near-continuous cataplexy episodes, usually precipitated by abrupt withdrawal of anticataplectic medications (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, sodium oxybate). REM-suppressing drugs should never be discontinued abruptly in narcolepsy — always taper. |

#### 2.4 Parasomnias — Specific Complications

| Complication | Affected Condition | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Physical injury** (self or bed partner) | Sleepwalking, RBD, sleep terrors | NREM parasomnias: walking into furniture, falling down stairs, exiting through windows. ***RBD: dream enactment behaviour, usually short ( < 60s), appear purposeful (e.g., throwing a ball, vocalisation)*** [2] → punching, kicking, falling out of bed → ecchymoses, fractures, subdural haematomas (in elderly). |
| ***Neurodegenerative conversion*** | RBD | ***50% of RBD is associated with neurological conditions*** [2]. Idiopathic RBD has ~80–90% conversion to synucleinopathies (PD, DLB, MSA) over 10–15 years. The degeneration of pontine REM-atonia centres (sublaterodorsal nucleus) in RBD reflects early alpha-synuclein pathology that will eventually spread to the substantia nigra (PD) or cortex (DLB). This is the most important long-term complication of RBD. |
| **Sleep-related injuries in children** | NREM parasomnias (sleepwalking) | Children may walk out of the house, fall down stairs, or injure themselves on household objects. Environment modification is the priority. |
| **Psychosocial distress** | Nightmares, sleep paralysis | ***Nightmares: fear response, ↑ awareness, ↑ SN tone upon awakening with vivid recall of content*** [2]. Recurrent nightmares (especially PTSD-related) cause fear of going to sleep → avoidance behaviour → worsening insomnia → vicious cycle. Sleep paralysis with hypnagogic hallucinations can be profoundly terrifying and may be misinterpreted as supernatural experiences. |
| **Obesity from SRED** | Sleep-related eating disorder | ***May be associated with obesity and ingestion of inedible substances (e.g., cat food, frozen food)*** [2]. Unconscious high-calorie consumption during sleep → significant weight gain over time. |

#### 2.5 Restless Leg Syndrome — Specific Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Chronic insomnia** | RLS → inability to relax in bed → severe sleep-onset insomnia → chronic sleep deprivation with all its systemic sequelae. |
| **Depression and anxiety** | Chronic sleep disruption + distressing sensory symptoms → high rates of comorbid depression and anxiety. ***Other features: insomnia, depression, anxiety*** [2]. |
| **Augmentation** (iatrogenic) | The most important complication of dopamine agonist treatment for RLS (covered in Management section). Paradoxical worsening with chronic DA agonist use → earlier onset, more severe, spread to arms. |
| **Iron deficiency consequences** | If secondary to iron deficiency: the underlying anaemia may have its own complications (fatigue, tachycardia, koilonychia, pica). |

#### 2.6 Circadian Rhythm Disorders — Specific Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Academic and occupational failure** | DSWPD in adolescents → ***↓ sleep time when combined with early school or work start times*** [2] → chronic partial sleep deprivation → ↓ academic performance, ↓ concentration, absenteeism, school dropout. This is a major public health issue in Hong Kong's education system. |
| **Metabolic syndrome** | Shift work disorder → chronic circadian misalignment → eating during the biological night (when insulin sensitivity is lowest) → ↑ T2DM risk, ↑ obesity. Shift workers have ~20–40% increased risk of CVD events. |
| **Mental health** | Circadian disruption → serotonergic and dopaminergic rhythm disruption → ↑ depression, ↑ anxiety. Seasonal affective disorder is related to photoperiod (light exposure duration) changes affecting circadian function. |
| **Cancer risk** | The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified shift work involving circadian disruption as a "probable carcinogen" (Group 2A). Mechanism: melatonin suppression → loss of melatonin's oncostatic properties (free radical scavenging, immune surveillance enhancement, anti-proliferative effects). Night shift workers have ↑ breast cancer risk. |

### 3. Iatrogenic Complications (Treatment-Related)

| Treatment | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Benzodiazepines / Z drugs** | Dependence, tolerance, rebound insomnia, falls (elderly), cognitive impairment, complex sleep behaviours (sleep-driving, sleep-eating with zolpidem), respiratory depression (especially in OSA — BZDs relax pharyngeal muscles → worsen apnoeas) | GABA-A receptor down-regulation with chronic use → tolerance → dose escalation → dependence. Sudden withdrawal → receptor hypoexcitability reversed → rebound hyperexcitability → insomnia worse than baseline, anxiety, potentially seizures. |
| **Dopamine agonists (for RLS)** | Augmentation (most important), impulse control disorders (pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping, binge eating) | Augmentation: D₂/D₃ receptor desensitisation. Impulse control: mesolimbic DA pathway overstimulation → reward circuit dysregulation. |
| **CPAP** | Non-adherence (the main "complication"), mask discomfort, nasal dryness/congestion, aerophagia (air swallowing → bloating), claustrophobia, skin breakdown at mask interface | Positive pressure → dries nasal mucosa; constant mask pressure → skin irritation; air entering oesophagus; psychological claustrophobia. Solutions: heated humidification, proper mask fitting, desensitisation therapy, alternative interfaces. |
| **Sodium oxybate** | CNS depression (especially if combined with alcohol or other sedatives), enuresis, nausea, abuse potential, respiratory depression | GABA-B agonism → potent CNS depression. Strictly regulated due to history of GHB abuse. |
| **SSRIs/SNRIs** (for cataplexy) | May precipitate or worsen RBD; status cataplecticus if abruptly withdrawn | Serotonergic modulation of pontine REM-atonia centres → paradoxically can reduce REM atonia in some patients. Abrupt withdrawal → rebound REM + rebound cataplexy. |
| **Modafinil** | Headache, nausea, anxiety, insomnia (if taken too late in the day), rare serious skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome — very rare) | Dopaminergic stimulation can cause anxiety/insomnia if dosing is not timed correctly (take in the morning). Rare hypersensitivity reactions. |

<Callout title="Exam Pearl: The Vicious Cycles of Sleep Disorders" type="error">

Sleep disorders create multiple self-reinforcing vicious cycles that explain their chronicity:

**Insomnia vicious cycle**: Poor sleep → daytime impairment → worry about sleep → hyperarousal → worse sleep → more worry (the "cycle of worry" [2])

**OSA vicious cycle**: OSA → sleep fragmentation → EDS → ↓ physical activity → weight gain → worsens OSA

**Insomnia-Depression cycle**: Insomnia → HPA dysregulation + serotonergic disruption → depression → worsens insomnia

**RLS-Iron cycle**: Low iron → low dopamine → RLS → poor sleep → ↓ dietary intake/↓ absorption → worsens iron deficiency

**Medication dependence cycle**: Insomnia → BZD use → tolerance → dose escalation → dependence → rebound insomnia on discontinuation → re-initiation

Breaking these vicious cycles is the therapeutic goal. CBT-I breaks the insomnia worry cycle. CPAP + weight loss breaks the OSA cycle. Iron repletion breaks the RLS-iron cycle. Gradual tapering with CBT-I support breaks the medication cycle.

### 4. Complications Specific to Hong Kong Context

| Issue | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Academic underperformance in adolescents** | DSWPD + early school start times (typically 08:00–08:30 in Hong Kong) → chronic partial sleep deprivation in a significant proportion of secondary school students → ↓ concentration, ↓ grades, ↓ wellbeing. Compounded by heavy homework load and screen use at night. |
| **Occupational injuries in shift workers** | Hong Kong's 24/7 service economy (healthcare, transport, hospitality, finance) has a large shift-working population → circadian disruption → ↑ accidents, ↑ metabolic disease. |
| **Undiagnosed OSA** | East Asian craniofacial anatomy predisposes to OSA at lower BMIs. Many Hong Kong patients with "lean OSA" go undiagnosed because the classic obese phenotype is not present. Late diagnosis → longer exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia → ↑ CVD burden. |
| **Benzodiazepine/Z drug overuse** | Due to limited CBT-I availability in Hong Kong, hypnotics are over-prescribed → dependence, falls in elderly (significant cause of hip fractures in ageing Hong Kong population), cognitive impairment. |

1. **Cardiovascular**: HTN (especially resistant — OSA is top secondary cause), CAD, HF, AF, stroke. Mechanism: sympathetic overdrive, intermittent hypoxia, endothelial dysfunction, chronic inflammation.

2. **Metabolic**: Obesity (↓ leptin, ↑ ghrelin), T2DM (↓ insulin sensitivity), dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome ("Syndrome Z" when combined with OSA).

3. **Neuropsychiatric**: Cognitive impairment, ↑ amygdala activation (emotional dysregulation), depression (RR ~2.5×), anxiety, hallucinations (severe deprivation), ADHD-mimicking symptoms in children.

4. **Immune**: ↓ NK cell activity, ↓ vaccine response, ↑ susceptibility to infection.

5. **OSA-specific**: Cor pulmonale, polycythaemia, RTA (2–7×), perioperative risk, nocturia.

6. **RBD-specific**: Physical injury (self/partner) and 80–90% conversion to synucleinopathies (PD, DLB, MSA) over 10–15 years.

7. **RLS-specific**: Chronic insomnia, depression/anxiety, augmentation from DA agonists.

8. **Iatrogenic**: BZD/Z drug dependence and rebound insomnia, DA agonist augmentation and impulse control disorders, CPAP non-adherence, status cataplecticus from abrupt SSRI withdrawal.

9. **Mortality**: U-shaped curve — both short ( < 7h) and long ( > 9h) sleep associated with ↑ all-cause mortality. Short sleep + insomnia phenotype carries highest CVS mortality risk.

10. **Vicious cycles**: Sleep disorders are self-perpetuating through multiple reinforcing loops (worry cycle in insomnia, weight gain cycle in OSA, medication dependence cycle). Breaking these cycles is the therapeutic goal.

Chronically elevated catecholamines cause peripheral vasoconstriction and increased SVR. Additional mechanisms: increased aldosterone secretion, endothelial dysfunction from oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation.

Fatigue also reduces physical activity. Insulin resistance: sympathetic activation increases cortisol and catecholamines (counter-regulatory hormones that oppose insulin action), and there is direct impairment of pancreatic beta-cell function.
