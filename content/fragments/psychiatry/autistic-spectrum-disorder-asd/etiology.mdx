# Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

---

## 1. Definition

Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a **neurodevelopmental disorder** characterised by persistent deficits in two core domains [1][2]:

1. **Social communication and social interaction** (across multiple contexts)
2. **Restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities (RRBs)**

Let's break down the name:
- **"Autistic"** — from Greek *autos* (αὐτός) = "self." The term was coined by Leo Kanner (1943) and Hans Asperger (1944) to describe children who seemed to live in their own world, turned inward.
- **"Spectrum"** — indicates a continuum of severity, from individuals requiring very substantial support (e.g., non-verbal with intellectual disability) to those who are highly verbal and academically capable but struggle with social nuances.
- **"Disorder"** — clinically significant impairment in functioning.

The key conceptual shift in DSM-5 (2013) was collapsing the previously separate diagnostic entities (autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, PDD-NOS, childhood disintegrative disorder) into a **single umbrella diagnosis** — ASD — with severity specifiers [1][2]. This was done because research showed these conditions shared the same underlying neurobiology and differed mainly in severity rather than kind.

<Callout title="DSM-5 vs ICD-10/11 Terminology">

- **DSM-5**: Single entity — *Autism Spectrum Disorder*. Those with isolated social communication deficits (without RRBs) are classified as *Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder* [2].
- **ICD-10** (still referenced in some HK settings): Groups ASD under *Pervasive Developmental Disorders (F84)*, which includes childhood autism, atypical autism, Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger syndrome, and PDD-NOS [2].
- **ICD-11** (adopted 2022, now current): Aligns with DSM-5 — single entity *Autism Spectrum Disorder (6A02)* with specifiers for intellectual and language functioning.

For exams, know both DSM-5 and ICD-10 classifications. The trend is towards the unified DSM-5/ICD-11 model.

## 2. Epidemiology

### 2.1 Prevalence

- **Worldwide prevalence**: approximately **1–1.5%** of the population [2]. The US CDC (2023 data) estimates ~1 in 36 children (2.8%), though this partly reflects broadened diagnostic criteria and improved surveillance.
- **Hong Kong**: Local studies suggest a prevalence of approximately **1 in 27 to 1 in 59** primary school children (estimates vary), with increasing referrals to the Child Assessment Service (CAS) of the Department of Health over the past two decades. HK figures are broadly consistent with international data.
- The apparent rise in prevalence over time is largely attributed to **diagnostic substitution** (children previously labelled as having intellectual disability or language disorders now receive ASD diagnoses), **broadened criteria**, **increased awareness**, and **earlier detection** — rather than a true increase in the underlying condition.

### 2.2 Demographics

- **Sex ratio**: **Male : Female ≈ 4–5 : 1** [2].
  - *Why the male predominance?* This is incompletely understood. The **"female protective effect"** hypothesis suggests that females require a greater cumulative genetic burden (more risk variants) to manifest ASD, meaning girls are relatively protected unless they carry a higher mutational load. When girls do present, they often have more severe phenotypes or co-occurring intellectual disability.
  - Additionally, **diagnostic bias** plays a role: girls with ASD may present with less obvious RRBs, better superficial social mimicry ("masking" or "camouflaging"), and more internalising symptoms, leading to under-recognition.
- **Socioeconomic status**: ASD occurs across all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups [2]. Earlier studies showing higher prevalence in higher-SES families were artefacts of diagnostic access bias.

### 2.3 Comorbidities

Comorbidity in ASD is the rule, not the exception [2]:

| Comorbidity | Approximate Prevalence | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Non-ASD developmental disorder** | ~83% | Especially language disorders (expressive and receptive) |
| **Intellectual disability (ID)** | ~31% meet criteria for ID; ~23% borderline | Previously thought ~70% had ID; revised downward with broader ASD definition |
| **Genetic/chromosomal disorders** | ~10% | Fragile X, tuberous sclerosis, Down syndrome, etc. |
| **Psychiatric disorders** | Up to 70% over lifetime | Anxiety (~40%), ADHD (~30–60%), depression (~12–20%), OCD, tic disorders |
| **Epilepsy** | ~20–30% | Higher in those with co-occurring ID; bimodal onset (early childhood & adolescence) |
| **Sleep disturbances** | ~50–80% | Insomnia, circadian rhythm abnormalities (↓ melatonin production) |
| **GI symptoms** | ~30–50% | Constipation, food selectivity, abdominal pain |
| **Motor difficulties** | Common | Hypotonia, dyspraxia, motor stereotypies |

<Callout title="High Yield — Comorbidity" type="idea">
Always screen for comorbid conditions in ASD. The psychiatric comorbidities (especially **anxiety**, **ADHD**, and **depression**) are often more amenable to treatment than the core ASD features themselves, and treating them can dramatically improve quality of life.

## 3. Risk Factors

### 3.1 Genetic / Family History (Strongest Risk Factor)

- **Family history of ASD**: Siblings of an individual with ASD have approximately a **3–10% recurrence risk** (25× the population risk) [2].
- Broader autism phenotype (BAP): Family members may show subclinical traits (social awkwardness, rigidity, language quirks) without meeting full diagnostic criteria.
- **Concordance rates**: MZ twins ~60–90% vs DZ twins ~0–30% [2] — demonstrating a very strong genetic contribution but also a role for non-shared environmental factors.

### 3.2 Prenatal / Perinatal Factors

- **Advanced paternal age** (and to a lesser extent, maternal age) — possibly related to accumulation of *de novo* mutations in sperm and/or alterations in genetic imprinting [2].
- **Maternal medication exposure**: Notably **valproate** (sodium valproate / Epilim) during pregnancy — well-established teratogen associated with ~10% risk of ASD in exposed offspring [2].
- **Obstetric complications**: Prematurity, low birth weight, perinatal hypoxia, birth defects [2]. These may act as "second hits" on a genetically vulnerable background.
- **Prenatal infections**: Rubella (historical), CMV, and possibly other TORCH infections.
- **Maternal factors**: Gestational diabetes, maternal immune activation during pregnancy (e.g., febrile illness), prenatal stress.

### 3.3 Environmental / Social Factors

- **Maternal migration** (especially if migration occurred around pregnancy): Possibly related to maternal stress, reduced immunity to endemic infections, or vitamin D deficiency [2].
- Socioeconomic factors primarily affect access to early diagnosis and intervention rather than causation per se.

### 3.4 What is NOT a Risk Factor

<Callout title="MMR Vaccine and ASD — Debunked" type="error">
The fraudulent 1998 Wakefield study claiming a link between the MMR vaccine and ASD has been thoroughly debunked and retracted. Multiple large-scale studies (including a 2019 Danish cohort of > 650,000 children) have found **no association** between MMR vaccination and ASD. Wakefield was struck off the medical register. This is a common public misconception that you should be able to address confidently.

Similarly, **thimerosal** (a mercury-containing preservative) in vaccines has no causal relationship to ASD.
</Callout>

- **Parenting style** is NOT a cause. The outdated "refrigerator mother" theory (Bettelheim, 1960s) — blaming cold, emotionally distant mothers — is categorically wrong and harmful.

## 4. Anatomy and Functional Neuroanatomy

Understanding the neuroanatomy helps explain *why* the clinical features of ASD occur. ASD is fundamentally a disorder of **brain connectivity and neural network organisation** rather than a single focal lesion.

### 4.1 Brain Growth Trajectory

- **Accelerated early brain growth**: Infants who later develop ASD often show accelerated head circumference growth during the first 1–2 years of life, resulting in **macrocephaly** in ~20% of cases [2]. This is followed by a plateau or even relative decline in brain volume later.
- *Why does this matter?* The period of accelerated growth coincides with critical windows for synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning. Aberrant overgrowth may reflect **deficient synaptic pruning** — too many synapses that are poorly organised, leading to noisy, inefficient neural circuits.

### 4.2 Structural Abnormalities

| Region | Abnormality | Functional Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **Prefrontal cortex** | Altered cortical thickness and columnar organisation | Impaired executive function (planning, cognitive flexibility, working memory) → contributes to rigidity and perseveration |
| **Fusiform gyrus** (fusiform face area) | Reduced activation during face processing | Difficulty recognising faces and reading facial expressions → social communication deficits |
| **Amygdala** | Early overgrowth (toddlers), then possible atrophy in adults | Abnormal emotional processing, fear conditioning, and social salience detection |
| **Superior temporal sulcus (STS)** | Reduced activation | STS is critical for perceiving biological motion, gaze direction, and vocal prosody → poor reading of social cues |
| **Cerebellum** | Reduced Purkinje cell numbers, structural anomalies | Motor coordination difficulties, possibly contributes to repetitive behaviours and cognitive processing |
| **Corpus callosum** | Often reduced in size | Impaired interhemispheric connectivity |
| **White matter tracts** | Abnormal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics | Reflects aberrant long-range connectivity |

### 4.3 Connectivity Model

The prevailing neurobiological model is one of **altered connectivity** [2]:
- **Under-connectivity** of long-range connections (e.g., frontal-posterior pathways) — impairs integration of information across brain regions (e.g., combining facial expression + voice tone + context to understand social meaning).
- **Over-connectivity** of local/short-range connections — may contribute to enhanced local processing (explaining savant abilities, attention to detail) but at the expense of holistic processing.

This maps beautifully onto the **Weak Central Coherence** theory (see below).

### 4.4 Neurochemistry

- **Serotonin (5-HT)**: ~30% of individuals with ASD have **hyperserotonemia** (elevated whole-blood serotonin) [2]. Serotonin is critical for brain development, mood regulation, and GI motility. This may explain both the psychiatric comorbidities and GI symptoms seen in ASD.
- **Oxytocin**: Reduced levels or altered receptor expression. Oxytocin is the "social bonding" neuropeptide → deficiency may contribute to impaired social motivation and attachment.
- **GABA/Glutamate imbalance**: Evidence of excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) imbalance in cortical circuits — possibly explaining sensory hypersensitivity and epilepsy risk.
- **Dopamine**: Mesolimbic pathway abnormalities may affect reward processing and social motivation [2].

### 4.5 Mirror Neuron System

- **Mirror neurons** (frontal and parietal regions) fire both when performing an action and when observing someone else perform the same action. They are thought to be the neural substrate for empathy, imitation, and understanding others' intentions.
- Evidence suggests **dysfunction of the mirror neuron system** in ASD [2], which may contribute to difficulties with imitation, empathy, and theory of mind.

## 5. Etiology and Pathophysiology

ASD etiology is **incompletely understood** but is best conceptualised as a **multifactorial, polygenic condition** with contributions from genetic, neurobiological, psychological, and environmental factors [2].

### 5.1 Biological Factors

#### 5.1.1 Genetics (The Dominant Aetiological Factor)

- **Heritability**: ~80–90% [2]. This is one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.
- **Genetic architecture** is complex and **polygenic** [2]:
  - **Common variants** (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs): Individually have tiny effect sizes but collectively explain a substantial portion of genetic risk. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of risk loci.
  - **Rare variants** (copy number variants — CNVs, and rare single-gene mutations): Higher individual effect sizes. Examples include deletions/duplications at 16p11.2, 15q11-13, and 22q11.2.
  - *De novo* mutations (not inherited from parents) account for a significant proportion of simplex (sporadic) cases. These are more common with advanced paternal age.
- **Implicated genes** tend to converge on pathways involved in [2]:
  - **Synaptic function**: SHANK3, NLGN3/4, NRXN1 (encode synaptic scaffolding and adhesion molecules)
  - **Chromatin remodelling / gene regulation**: CHD8, ARID1B
  - **mTOR / PI3K signalling**: PTEN, TSC1/TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis)
  - **Synaptic pruning**: Aberrant pruning during critical developmental periods → excess or poorly organised synapses
- **Associated genetic syndromes** (~10% of ASD cases have an identifiable genetic syndrome) [2]:
  - **Fragile X syndrome** (FMR1 trinucleotide repeat expansion) — most common single-gene cause
  - **Tuberous sclerosis** (TSC1/TSC2) — ~50% develop ASD
  - **Rett syndrome** (MECP2 mutation) — now classified separately in DSM-5 but historically overlapped
  - Others: Angelman syndrome (15q11-13), Phelan-McDermid syndrome (22q13.3/SHANK3), Down syndrome, neurofibromatosis, muscular dystrophy [2]

#### 5.1.2 Neurobiological (covered in Section 4)

Key points to reiterate:
- **Atypical brain maturation trajectory** (accelerated early growth, aberrant pruning) [2]
- **Altered gray/white matter volumes** and cortical organisation [2]
- **Serotonergic system abnormalities** [2]
- **Different patterns of brain connectivity** for tasks requiring social attribution and social/nonsocial rewards [2]
- **Mesolimbic pathway and mirror neuron abnormalities** [2]
- **Cerebellar abnormalities** [2]

#### 5.1.3 Immune / Inflammatory Factors

- Maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy (e.g., viral infection, autoimmune disease) is associated with increased ASD risk. Animal models show that maternal cytokine release (especially IL-6) can disrupt fetal brain development [2].
- Some children with ASD show evidence of **neuroinflammation** (activated microglia, elevated cytokines in CSF) and altered immune profiles.

### 5.2 Psychological Factors (Cognitive Theories)

These are not "causes" of ASD but rather **cognitive frameworks** that attempt to explain the pattern of deficits and strengths seen in ASD [2]:

#### 5.2.1 Theory of Mind (ToM) Deficit

- **Theory of Mind** = the ability to attribute mental states (beliefs, desires, intentions, knowledge) to oneself and others, and to understand that others have beliefs different from one's own [2].
- Typically develops by age **4 years** (tested by the classic **Sally-Anne false belief task** or **Smarties task**).
- Individuals with ASD show delayed or impaired ToM → they struggle to:
  - Predict others' behaviour based on mental states
  - Understand deception, irony, sarcasm
  - Appreciate "white lies" or social conventions
  - Engage in pretend play (which requires imagining another's perspective)
- *Limitation*: ToM deficits are not entirely specific to ASD (also seen in schizophrenia, some intellectual disabilities) and do not explain all ASD features (e.g., RRBs, sensory issues) [2].

> **The Sally-Anne Test**: Sally puts her ball in a basket, then leaves the room. Anne moves the ball to a box. When Sally returns, where does she look for the ball? Correct answer = "the basket" (because Sally doesn't know Anne moved it). Children with ASD typically fail this by saying "the box" — they cannot separate their own knowledge from Sally's [2].

#### 5.2.2 Executive Function Theory

- **Executive functions** (mediated by prefrontal cortex) include planning, cognitive flexibility, working memory, inhibitory control, and self-monitoring [2].
- Individuals with ASD often show impairment in executive function → leads to:
  - **Perseveration** (difficulty shifting between tasks/topics)
  - **Poor self-regulation** (meltdowns when routines change)
  - **Difficulty extracting higher-level meaning** from complex information [2]
  - Rigid adherence to rules and routines
- *Limitation*: Executive dysfunction is also seen in ADHD and other conditions; not specific to ASD [2].

#### 5.2.3 Weak Central Coherence (WCC) Theory

- Proposed by Uta Frith. Central coherence = the tendency to process information **globally** (seeing the "big picture") by integrating contextual information [2].
- Individuals with ASD show a **"local processing bias"** — they excel at detail-focused tasks but struggle to integrate parts into a meaningful whole [2].
- This explains:
  - **Islets of ability / savant skills**: Exceptional memory for facts, calendar calculation, musical pitch, jigsaw puzzles (tasks benefiting from local processing) [2]
  - **Difficulty with pragmatic language**: Understanding sentences literally rather than inferring meaning from context
  - **Sensory hypersensitivity**: Enhanced perception of individual sensory details
- *Limitation*: Not all individuals with ASD show WCC; some can be taught to process globally [2].

#### 5.2.4 Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF) Theory

- Related to WCC. Proposes that individuals with ASD have genuinely superior low-level perceptual processing. This is a **strength-based** model rather than a deficit model.

#### 5.2.5 Social Motivation Theory

- Proposes that the core deficit in ASD is reduced **social motivation** — reduced reward value of social stimuli (faces, voices, social approval).
- Mediated by reduced activation of the mesolimbic dopamine reward system in response to social stimuli.
- Leads to reduced social attention from infancy → less social learning → cumulative social communication deficits over development.

### 5.3 Environmental / Social Factors

| Factor | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Obstetric complications** (prematurity, perinatal hypoxia, low birth weight) | May act as "second hits" on a genetically predisposed brain [2] |
| **Maternal valproate use** | Disrupts fetal brain development (altered neuronal migration, apoptosis); well-established dose-dependent risk [2] |
| **Advanced paternal age** | Increased de novo mutations in sperm; altered epigenetic imprinting [2] |
| **Prenatal infections** | Maternal immune activation → fetal neuroinflammation [2] |
| **Maternal migration around pregnancy** | ?Stress, ?↓immunity to endemic infections, ?vitamin D deficiency [2] |

<Callout title="The Biopsychosocial Model of ASD" type="idea">
ASD is best understood as arising from **polygenic genetic vulnerability** interacting with **prenatal/perinatal environmental exposures**, leading to **aberrant neurodevelopmental trajectory** (abnormal synaptogenesis, pruning, and connectivity), which produces the **cognitive phenotype** (impaired ToM, executive dysfunction, WCC), which in turn manifests as the **behavioural phenotype** (social communication deficits + RRBs). The psychological theories describe *how* the brain processes information differently; the neurobiology describes *why*.

## 6. Classification

### 6.1 DSM-5 Classification (Current Standard)

**ASD (299.00)** is a single diagnostic entity with specifiers [1]:

| Specifier | Options |
|---|---|
| **Severity level** | Level 1: "Requiring support" |
| | Level 2: "Requiring substantial support" |
| | Level 3: "Requiring very substantial support" |
| **With/without intellectual impairment** | e.g., ASD with accompanying intellectual impairment |
| **With/without language impairment** | e.g., ASD with accompanying language impairment |
| **Associated conditions** | e.g., associated with a known medical/genetic condition (Fragile X, tuberous sclerosis) or environmental factor (valproate exposure) |
| **Associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioural disorder** | e.g., associated with ADHD, anxiety disorder |
| **With catatonia** | A rare but important specifier |

### 6.2 ICD-10 Classification (Historical, Still Referenced in HK)

Under **Pervasive Developmental Disorders (F84)** [2]:

| ICD-10 Code | Diagnosis | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| F84.0 | **Childhood autism** | Classical autism with all 3 domains manifesting before age 3 [2] |
| F84.1 | **Atypical autism** | Does not meet full temporal or symptomatic criteria for childhood autism [2] |
| F84.2 | **Rett syndrome** | Female-only, MECP2 mutation, progressive encephalopathy after 6 months of normal development [2] |
| F84.3 | **Other childhood disintegrative disorder** | Normal development followed by regression of acquired skills [2] |
| F84.4 | Overactive disorder with mental retardation and stereotyped movements | Poorly defined category |
| F84.5 | **Asperger syndrome** | Autistic features WITHOUT delay in language or cognitive development [2] |
| F84.8/9 | PDD-NOS | Residual category |

### 6.3 ICD-11 Classification (Current, from 2022)

Aligns with DSM-5 — **single entity ASD (6A02)** with dimensional specifiers for:
- Intellectual functioning (with/without disorder of intellectual development)
- Functional language level (with/without impairment of functional language)
- Loss of previously acquired skills

<Callout title="Asperger Syndrome — Historical Term" type="error">
"Asperger syndrome" is no longer a separate diagnosis in DSM-5 or ICD-11. These individuals would now be diagnosed as ASD Level 1 (requiring support), without intellectual impairment, without language impairment. However, the term remains in common use among patients, families, and some clinicians. For exams, know that it is subsumed under ASD in current classifications.

## 7. Clinical Features

The clinical presentation of ASD varies enormously across the spectrum. Features are organised into the **two DSM-5 core domains** plus associated features. For each feature, the underlying pathophysiological/cognitive basis is explained inline.

### 7.1 Domain A: Persistent Deficits in Social Communication and Social Interaction

These must be present **across multiple contexts** (not just one setting).

#### 7.1.1 Deficits in Social-Emotional Reciprocity

| Feature | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Reduced social approach / sharing of interests** | Diminished initiation of social interaction; does not spontaneously share enjoyment or interests with others (e.g., a toddler who finds a bug but doesn't bring it to show a parent) | ↓ Social motivation (mesolimbic reward pathway dysfunction) → social stimuli are less intrinsically rewarding → less drive to seek social engagement |
| **Failure of normal conversational turn-taking** | One-sided conversations, monologues about topics of interest, difficulty maintaining the "volley" of dialogue | Impaired ToM → cannot gauge what the listener knows/wants to hear; executive dysfunction → difficulty shifting topics; WCC → over-focus on own interest |
| **Reduced sharing of emotions and affect** | Flat or incongruent emotional expression; may not respond to others' emotional cues (e.g., does not comfort a crying friend) | Impaired affective ToM + mirror neuron dysfunction → difficulty recognising and resonating with others' emotional states |
| **Abnormal social approach behaviours** | May approach others in odd ways (too close, too formal, too blunt) | Impaired understanding of social norms and pragmatic rules |

**Age-specific manifestations** [2]:
- **Infants/toddlers**: Reduced social smiling, poor eye contact, lack of anticipatory reaching, absence of **joint attention** (not following a point, not pointing to share interest — a critical early red flag, typically emerges 9–14 months), lack of showing/bringing objects.
- **Preschool**: Not responsive to other people's feelings; lack of pretend/social play; unable to share pleasure; does not point out objects to another person [2].
- **School-age**: Inability to join in play with peers (occasionally disruptive); easily overwhelmed by social stimulation; extreme reactions to invasion of personal space [2].
- **Adolescents**: Socially naïve, not as independent as peers; difficulty making and maintaining peer friendships [2].

#### 7.1.2 Deficits in Nonverbal Communication

| Feature | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Poor eye contact** | Reduced, absent, or unusual eye contact (either avoidance or overly intense staring) | Multiple factors: amygdala hyperactivation in response to direct gaze (gaze feels threatening) + reduced fusiform face area activation (faces are not processed as socially salient) + reduced social reward from faces |
| **Abnormal body language and gestures** | Reduced use of pointing, waving, nodding, head-shaking; gestures may be clumsy or absent | Impaired mirror neuron system → difficulty acquiring and using communicative gestures through observation and imitation |
| **Flat, monotonous, or unusual prosody** | Speech may be robotic, sing-song, overly formal, or have unusual rhythm/volume | Difficulty modulating suprasegmental features of speech (prosody is a right-hemisphere / subcortical function); reduced understanding of prosodic cues in others (STS underactivation) |
| **Reduced facial expressiveness** | Limited range of facial expressions; expressions may be incongruent with emotional context | Mirror neuron dysfunction + impaired emotional regulation |
| **Poor integration of verbal and nonverbal communication** | Words say one thing, body language says another; or cannot "read" when someone's words and body language are mismatched | WCC / poor multimodal integration; difficulty integrating information across modalities |

#### 7.1.3 Deficits in Developing, Maintaining, and Understanding Relationships

| Feature | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Difficulty adjusting behaviour to social context** | Same behaviour at a funeral as at a party; too formal with peers, too casual with authorities | Impaired ToM → cannot read contextual social demands; executive dysfunction → difficulty flexibly adapting |
| **Difficulty sharing imaginative play** | Absent or reduced pretend play (e.g., does not feed a doll, does not play "house") | Pretend play requires ToM (imagining the doll is "real" and has needs) + creative flexibility |
| **Apparent lack of interest in peers** | Preference for solitary play; or desire for friendship but inability to form/maintain it | ↓ Social motivation in some; impaired social skills preventing friendship formation in others (different subgroups) |
| **Difficulty understanding unwritten social rules** | Does not grasp concepts like personal space, turn-taking in games, "reading the room" | Impaired implicit social learning (relies on explicit teaching of rules that neurotypical children absorb implicitly) |

### 7.2 Domain B: Restricted, Repetitive Patterns of Behaviour, Interests, or Activities (RRBs)

At least **2 of 4** subcategories must be present (currently or by history):

#### 7.2.1 Stereotyped or Repetitive Motor Movements, Use of Objects, or Speech

| Feature | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Motor stereotypies** | Hand-flapping, finger-flicking, spinning, rocking, toe-walking | Basal ganglia / cortico-striatal circuit dysfunction → repetitive motor patterns; also may serve as self-stimulation ("stimming") to regulate sensory input |
| **Unusual use of objects** | Lining up toys in rows, spinning wheels on a car (rather than playing with the whole car), flipping objects | WCC → focus on parts rather than whole; preference for predictable, repetitive sensory input |
| **Echolalia** | Immediate (parroting back what was just said) or delayed (repeating phrases from TV shows, books, or past conversations) [2] | Language processing differences → gestalt language acquisition (learning language in "chunks" rather than analytically building sentences from words) |
| **Idiosyncratic language** | Pronoun reversal (referring to self as "you" or "he/she" beyond age 3) [2]; unusual vocabulary for child's age [2]; stereotyped phrases | Impaired pragmatic language development; echolalic origin of pronoun reversal (echoes the pronoun used by the speaker, e.g., "Do you want a drink?" → "You want a drink") |
| **Persistent echolalia beyond typical age** | Normal toddlers may echo briefly; persistence is atypical [2] | As above |

#### 7.2.2 Insistence on Sameness, Inflexible Adherence to Routines, Ritualized Patterns

| Feature | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Insistence on sameness** | Extreme distress at small changes (taking a different route to school, rearranged furniture, food presented differently) | Executive dysfunction (cognitive inflexibility) + anxiety in the face of unpredictability → routines provide predictability and reduce anxiety |
| **Rigid rituals** | Must follow exact sequences (e.g., specific bedtime routine, specific order of dressing) | As above; also related to need for predictability in a world that feels chaotic due to impaired social understanding |
| **Difficulty managing change** [2] | Transitions between activities are especially difficult | Poor cognitive flexibility (prefrontal dysfunction) |
| **Rigid thinking patterns** | Black-and-white thinking; difficulty with ambiguity; literal interpretation of language | WCC + executive dysfunction |

#### 7.2.3 Highly Restricted, Fixated Interests Abnormal in Intensity or Focus

| Feature | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Circumscribed interests** | Intense preoccupation with specific topics (e.g., trains, dinosaurs, weather patterns, licence plates) that is unusual in intensity and depth [2] | Altered reward processing → these interests activate the dopaminergic reward system more strongly than social stimuli; WCC → ability to accumulate vast detailed knowledge in narrow domains |
| **Preference for highly specific, narrow interests or hobbies** [2] | May enjoy collecting, numbering, or listing [2] | Local processing bias → satisfaction from cataloguing and systematising |
| **Strong attachment to unusual objects** | Carrying the same piece of string, rubber band, or specific object everywhere | Need for sameness + sensory properties of the object |
| **Tendency to talk freely only about specific topics** [2] | Monologues on favourite subject; difficulty engaging with others' topics | Impaired ToM (doesn't recognise listener's disinterest) + intrinsic reward from the topic |

#### 7.2.4 Hyper- or Hypo-reactivity to Sensory Input or Unusual Interest in Sensory Aspects of the Environment

This was newly added in DSM-5 as a formal criterion, reflecting strong research evidence:

| Feature | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Sensory hypersensitivity** | Distress from loud noises (covering ears), certain textures (tags on clothing, food textures), bright lights, strong smells | GABAergic E/I imbalance in sensory cortices → reduced sensory gating / filtering → sensory input is experienced as overwhelming |
| **Sensory hyposensitivity** | Apparent indifference to pain or temperature; may not notice injuries | Altered sensory processing thresholds; possibly related to endogenous opioid system differences |
| **Unusual sensory seeking** | Fascination with spinning objects, lights, water flowing; sniffing objects; visual inspection of objects at unusual angles [2] | Seeking specific sensory input that is experienced as pleasurable or calming (self-regulatory function) |
| **Unusual reactions to sensory stimuli** [2] | Variable — can be hyper or hypo depending on the modality and context | Atypical sensory processing across thalamo-cortical pathways |

### 7.3 Additional Clinical Features and Signs (Not Part of Core Diagnostic Criteria but Important)

#### 7.3.1 Language and Communication

- **Delay or absence of spoken language** [2] — ranges from completely nonverbal (~25-30%) to verbose/pedantic speech.
- **Unusual vocabulary** for child's age — may use overly formal or adult-like language [2].
- **Speech peculiarities** in adolescents [2] — odd prosody, pedantic style, overly literal.
- **Pragmatic language deficits**: Difficulty with conversational conventions (taking turns, staying on topic, understanding indirect requests, humour, irony, metaphor).
- **Pronoun reversal** — referring to self as "you", "she", or "he" beyond 3 years [2].

#### 7.3.2 Play and Imagination

- **Lack of pretend play or social play** [2]: Reduced symbolic/imaginative play. May play functionally with toys (pushing a car) but not symbolically (pretending the car is a spaceship).
- **Problems using imagination** [2] in adolescents.
- **Solitary play** preferred or parallel play without true interactive/cooperative play.

#### 7.3.3 Motor Features

- **Motor clumsiness / dyspraxia**: Gross and fine motor difficulties (cerebellar dysfunction, impaired motor planning).
- **Toe-walking**: Relatively common in young children with ASD.
- **Hypotonia**: Reduced muscle tone, especially in infancy.

#### 7.3.4 Cognitive Profile

- **Uneven cognitive profile**: Often a discrepancy between performance IQ and verbal IQ. Some areas of exceptional ability alongside significant deficits.
- **Islets of ability / savant skills** [2]: ~10% show special talents (music, drawing, calculation, memory) — explained by WCC/local processing bias.

#### 7.3.5 Behavioural Features

- **Self-injurious behaviour** (head-banging, biting self): More common in ASD with intellectual disability. Related to communication frustration, sensory-seeking, or anxiety.
- **Meltdowns**: Not tantrums — these are overwhelming responses to sensory or emotional overload when coping mechanisms are exhausted.
- **Food selectivity**: Extreme, beyond typical "picky eating." Related to sensory sensitivities (texture, colour, smell).

### 7.4 Clinical Clues by Age Group

This is extremely high-yield for recognising ASD at different developmental stages [2]:

#### Preschool Children [2]
- Delay or absence of spoken language
- Not responsive to other people's feelings
- Lack of pretend play or social play
- Unable to share pleasure
- Does not point out objects to another person
- Unusual or repetitive hand and finger mannerisms
- Unusual reactions to sensory stimuli

#### School-Age Children [2]
- Persistent echolalia
- Reference to self as "you", "she", or "he" beyond 3 years
- Unusual vocabulary for child's age
- Tendency to talk freely only about specific topics
- Inability to join in play of other children (occasionally disruptive)
- Easily overwhelmed by social and other stimulation
- Extreme reactions to invasion of personal space
- Difficulty managing change

#### Adolescents [2]
- Socially naïve, not as independent as peers
- Speech peculiarities
- Difficulty making and maintaining peer friendships
- Preference for highly specific, narrow interests or hobbies, or may enjoy collecting, numbering, or listing
- Strong preferences for familiar routines
- Problems using imagination

<Callout title="Red Flags for Early ASD — Know These Cold">

The earliest red flags (by 12–18 months) that should prompt developmental evaluation:
1. **No babbling** by 12 months
2. **No gestures** (pointing, waving) by 12 months
3. **No single words** by 16 months
4. **No 2-word spontaneous phrases** by 24 months
5. **Loss of previously acquired language or social skills** at any age (regression — occurs in ~25-30% of ASD cases)
6. **Absence of joint attention** (not following a point, not pointing to share interest)
7. **No response to name** by 12 months
8. **Reduced or absent eye contact**
</Callout>

### 7.5 Signs on Examination

While ASD is primarily diagnosed through behavioural observation and history, clinical examination may reveal:

| Sign | Significance |
|---|---|
| **Macrocephaly** (head circumference > 97th centile) | Present in ~20%; reflects accelerated early brain growth |
| **Dysmorphic features** | Suggest syndromic ASD (Fragile X: long face, prominent ears, macroorchidism; Tuberous sclerosis: ash-leaf spots, shagreen patches; etc.) |
| **Hypotonia** | Common associated motor finding |
| **Absence of pointing / showing / joint attention** | Core social communication deficit |
| **Poor eye contact** during examination | Not diagnostic in isolation but contributory |
| **Motor stereotypies** observed during assessment | Hand-flapping, spinning, repetitive movements |
| **Unusual sensory behaviours** | Sniffing, licking, visual inspection at unusual angles |
| **Lack of functional/pretend play** during free play observation | Plays repetitively or with parts of objects rather than symbolically |
| **Echolalia or pronoun reversal** during language assessment | Language features suggestive of ASD |
| **Skin examination findings** | Café-au-lait spots (NF1), ash-leaf macules (tuberous sclerosis), etc. — look for syndromic causes |

## 8. Summary Table — Linking Pathophysiology to Clinical Features

| Pathophysiological Mechanism | Cognitive Theory | Clinical Manifestation |
|---|---|---|
| ↓ Fusiform face area activation | — | Poor face recognition, reduced gaze |
| ↓ Mesolimbic reward to social stimuli | Social motivation theory | Reduced social initiation, preference for objects over people |
| Mirror neuron dysfunction | — | Impaired imitation, empathy, gesture use |
| Amygdala dysfunction | — | Abnormal emotional processing, difficulty reading emotions |
| STS underactivation | — | Poor reading of gaze, biological motion, prosody |
| Prefrontal dysfunction | Executive function theory | Perseveration, rigidity, poor planning |
| Cortico-striatal loop dysfunction | — | Motor stereotypies, rituals |
| Altered long-range connectivity | Weak central coherence | Local processing bias, islets of ability, difficulty seeing "big picture" |
| E/I imbalance (GABA/glutamate) | — | Sensory hyper/hyposensitivity, seizure risk |
| Serotonergic abnormalities | — | Mood/anxiety comorbidity, GI symptoms |
| Impaired ToM neural network | Theory of mind deficit | Cannot understand others' perspectives, poor pragmatic language |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Definition**: ASD = neurodevelopmental disorder with (1) persistent deficits in social communication/interaction + (2) restricted, repetitive behaviours (RRBs). DSM-5 = single entity; ICD-10 = pervasive developmental disorders.

**Epidemiology**: ~1% prevalence; M:F ≈ 4-5:1; high comorbidity with ID (~31%), ADHD, anxiety, epilepsy.

**Aetiology**: Heritability ~80-90%. Polygenic (common SNPs + rare CNVs). Environmental second hits (prematurity, valproate, paternal age). NOT caused by vaccines or parenting.

**Pathophysiology**: Aberrant synaptic pruning → altered connectivity (↓ long-range, ↑ local) → cognitive phenotype (impaired ToM, executive dysfunction, WCC) → behavioural phenotype.

**Key Cognitive Theories**: (1) Theory of Mind deficit → social communication problems; (2) Executive function impairment → rigidity, perseveration; (3) Weak Central Coherence → local processing bias, islets of ability.

**Core Features — Domain A (Social Communication)**: Reduced reciprocity, poor nonverbal communication (eye contact, gestures, prosody), difficulty with relationships.

**Core Features — Domain B (RRBs)**: Motor stereotypies, insistence on sameness, circumscribed interests, sensory hyper/hyposensitivity. Need ≥ 2 of 4.

**Red Flags (Early)**: No babbling by 12mo, no gestures by 12mo, no words by 16mo, no 2-word phrases by 24mo, regression at any age, absent joint attention.

**Clinical Clues by Age**: Preschool (no pretend play, no pointing, language delay), School-age (echolalia, pronoun reversal, can't join play), Adolescent (socially naïve, narrow interests, speech peculiarities).

      question: "Name the two core diagnostic domains of ASD according to DSM-5, and state how many subcategories of Domain B must be present.",
      markscheme: "Domain A: Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction. Domain B: Restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities. At least 2 of 4 subcategories of Domain B must be present (currently or by history)."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain three cognitive theories proposed to underlie the clinical features of ASD, and for each, give one clinical feature it explains.",
      markscheme: "(1) Theory of Mind deficit - explains difficulty understanding others perspectives, failure of Sally-Anne task, poor pragmatic language. (2) Executive function theory - explains perseveration, difficulty with change, rigid routines (prefrontal dysfunction). (3) Weak central coherence - explains local processing bias, islets of ability/savant skills, difficulty seeing big picture."

      question: "A 2-year-old boy does not point to objects, has no words, and lines up his toy cars repetitively. What are the key red flags for ASD here, and what is the earliest age at which absence of joint attention should raise concern?",
      markscheme: "Red flags: absence of pointing (gesture deficit), no single words by 16 months (language delay), repetitive lining up of toys (stereotyped use of objects - RRB). Joint attention (pointing to share interest, following a point) should typically emerge by 9-14 months; its absence by 12 months is an early red flag for ASD."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is the concordance rate for ASD higher in monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins, and what does this tell us about ASD aetiology? Give approximate concordance rates.",
      markscheme: "MZ concordance approximately 60-90% vs DZ approximately 0-30%. Since MZ twins share nearly 100% of DNA while DZ share approximately 50%, the much higher MZ concordance indicates a strong genetic component to ASD (heritability approximately 80-90%). The fact that MZ concordance is not 100% implies non-shared environmental factors also play a role."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain why sensory hypersensitivity occurs in ASD, and name two clinical examples.",
      markscheme: "Sensory hypersensitivity is due to GABA-glutamate excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in sensory cortices leading to reduced sensory gating/filtering, so sensory input is experienced as overwhelming. Examples: (1) Distress from loud noises - covering ears; (2) Intolerance of certain clothing textures (e.g., tags); (3) Food selectivity based on texture; (4) Distress from bright lights."
    },
    {
      question: "List three identifiable genetic syndromes associated with ASD and one key clinical feature of each.",
      markscheme: "(1) Fragile X syndrome (FMR1 trinucleotide repeat) - long face, prominent ears, macroorchidism, intellectual disability. (2) Tuberous sclerosis (TSC1/TSC2) - ash-leaf spots, shagreen patches, seizures, cortical tubers. (3) Rett syndrome (MECP2 mutation) - female-only, progressive encephalopathy after 6 months of normal development, loss of hand skills, stereotypic hand wringing."
