## Complications of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

The complications of ASD are best understood not as "things that go wrong with ASD" in the way a myocardial infarction complicates coronary artery disease, but rather as the **downstream consequences** of living with a neurodevelopmental condition that impairs social communication and behavioural flexibility across the lifespan. They fall into several categories: psychiatric comorbidities, behavioural complications, neurological complications, physical health complications, psychosocial/functional complications, and family impact.

The key conceptual framework: ASD creates a **cascading developmental trajectory** — early social communication deficits → reduced social learning opportunities → impaired relationship formation → social isolation → psychiatric vulnerability → functional impairment → reduced independence. Each "complication" can be traced back to the core deficits through this chain.

### 1. Psychiatric Comorbidities

Psychiatric comorbidity is the **rule, not the exception** in ASD. Lifetime prevalence of at least one co-occurring psychiatric condition exceeds 70%. These are often the most treatable aspects of ASD and the greatest drivers of distress and functional impairment.

#### 1.1 Anxiety Disorders (~40-50%)

- **The most common psychiatric comorbidity in ASD** [2].
- **Types**: Specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, separation anxiety, selective mutism, OCD.
- **Why anxiety is so common in ASD from first principles**:
  - Individuals with ASD live in a social world they cannot intuitively decode. Imagine navigating a foreign country where you don't speak the language, can't read body language, and every interaction could go wrong unpredictably — that is the daily reality for many people with ASD. This chronic **unpredictability** breeds anxiety.
  - Executive dysfunction (cognitive inflexibility) means they cannot easily adapt when things change → any deviation from routine is experienced as threatening.
  - Sensory hypersensitivity means the physical environment itself can feel hostile (loud, bright, overwhelming).
  - Impaired interoception (difficulty reading one's own bodily signals) means they may not recognise anxiety building until it reaches a crisis point (meltdown/shutdown).
  - *Especially in the adolescent stage* [2] — as social demands increase and awareness of being "different" grows, anxiety intensifies.
- **Clinical presentation**: May present atypically — as increased RRBs, insistence on sameness, avoidance, aggression, meltdowns, or withdrawal rather than verbalising "I feel anxious."
- **Management**: Modified CBT (if cognitive/verbal ability sufficient), environmental modifications, SSRIs if severe [2].

#### 1.2 ADHD (~30-50%) [2]

- **Behavioural problems, e.g., hyperactivity** [2] and inattention are extremely common.
- Prior to DSM-5, dual diagnosis of ASD and ADHD was not permitted; now it is recognised as a genuine comorbidity.
- **Why ADHD co-occurs so frequently**: Shared genetic architecture (overlapping risk loci), shared neurobiological substrate (prefrontal dysfunction, dopaminergic dysregulation), and executive function deficits are core to both conditions.
- **Impact**: ADHD symptoms compound the social difficulties of ASD — the child not only doesn't understand social cues but also can't sustain attention to learn them. Impulsivity leads to additional social rejection.
- **Management**: Methylphenidate (lower response rate in ASD+ADHD, ~50%), atomoxetine, guanfacine [2].

#### 1.3 Depression (~12-40%, especially in adolescence and adulthood)

- **Mood problems: anxiety, depression (especially in the adolescent stage)** [2].
- **Why depression emerges, especially in adolescence from first principles**:
  - Increased self-awareness in adolescence → the individual with ASD becomes painfully aware of their social differences and struggles.
  - Repeated social failure and rejection → learned helplessness.
  - Social isolation → absence of protective social buffering.
  - The chronic stress and effort of "masking" (maintaining a socially acceptable facade) is exhausting and demoralising [2]. ASD adults use **compensation strategies and coping mechanisms to mask their difficulties in public but suffer from the stress and effort** [2].
  - Biological vulnerability: serotonergic system abnormalities predispose to mood disorders.
- **Clinical presentation**: May present atypically — irritability, increased RRBs, withdrawal, loss of previously acquired skills, changes in sleep/appetite, self-harm. Verbally limited individuals may not be able to articulate low mood.
- **Management**: SSRIs (start low, go slow), modified CBT, addressing psychosocial stressors (bullying, isolation).

#### 1.4 OCD (~17-37%)

- Distinguish from core ASD RRBs: OCD obsessions/compulsions are **ego-dystonic** (distressing), whereas ASD RRBs are typically **ego-syntonic** (comforting). However, true OCD can develop on top of ASD.
- **Why OCD co-occurs**: Shared cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit dysfunction; serotonergic abnormalities common to both.
- **Management**: SSRIs, modified exposure and response prevention (ERP) CBT.

#### 1.5 Psychotic Disorders

- Lifetime risk of psychosis is modestly increased in ASD (estimated ~5-10%, vs ~1% population base rate).
- Atypical beliefs or unusual perceptual experiences in ASD can be misdiagnosed as psychosis (diagnostic overshadowing).
- True comorbid schizophrenia requires prominent delusions/hallucinations for ≥ 1 month (DSM-5 Criterion F for schizophrenia) [2].

#### 1.6 Eating Disorders

- ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) is particularly common — driven by sensory sensitivities (texture, taste, smell, appearance), insistence on sameness (eating only specific foods), and anxiety around novel foods.
- Anorexia nervosa: emerging evidence that ASD is over-represented in anorexia, possibly related to cognitive rigidity, weak central coherence (focus on caloric detail), and difficulty with interoception.

#### 1.7 Tic Disorders / Tourette Syndrome (~14-22%)

- Shared neurobiological substrate (basal ganglia / cortico-striatal circuits).

---

### 2. Behavioural Complications

#### 2.1 Self-Injurious Behaviour (SIB) [2]

- **Behavioural problems, e.g., self-injurious behaviour** [2]: Head-banging, biting self, scratching, hitting self. More common in ASD with co-occurring intellectual disability.
- **Why SIB occurs from first principles**:
  - **Communication frustration**: A non-verbal child who cannot express pain, hunger, discomfort, or distress may resort to SIB as the only available "communication."
  - **Sensory function**: SIB can provide intense sensory input that modulates an under-stimulated sensory system (hyposensitivity to pain).
  - **Escape/avoidance**: SIB may function to escape demands or unwanted sensory experiences.
  - **Automatic reinforcement**: Endogenous opioid release from self-injury may create a self-reinforcing cycle.
- **Management**: Functional behavioural assessment (identify the function) → teach replacement behaviour → environmental modification. Risperidone/aripiprazole for severe cases [2].

#### 2.2 Aggression and Challenging Behaviour [2]

- **Disruptive or challenging behaviour** [2]: Aggression towards others, property destruction, tantrums.
- **Why**: Similar functional analysis to SIB — communication of unmet needs, sensory overload, demand avoidance, disruption of routines, anxiety, pain/medical issues.
- **Critical point**: Always consider whether a **medical cause** is driving the behavioural change. Individuals with ASD who cannot verbalise pain may present with sudden behavioural deterioration when they have dental pain, ear infection, constipation, GERD, fractures, etc. The behaviour IS the communication.

<Callout title="Sudden Behavioural Change = Think Medical Cause" type="error">

When a previously stable individual with ASD suddenly develops new or worsened challenging behaviour, ALWAYS rule out a medical cause before attributing it to "behavioural" or psychiatric factors. Common culprits:
- **Pain**: dental caries, otitis media, constipation, GERD, fractures, menstrual pain
- **Seizures**: new-onset or worsening epilepsy
- **Medication side effects**: akathisia from antipsychotics (restlessness misinterpreted as agitation)
- **Sleep deprivation**
- **Environmental change**: new teacher, school transition, family disruption

This is the most commonly missed clinical pitfall in ASD care.
</Callout>

#### 2.3 Soiling and Enuresis [2]

- **Soiling/enuresis** [2]: Delayed toilet training is common due to difficulties with interoception (not recognising bladder/bowel signals), communication (can't tell a caregiver they need the toilet), insistence on sameness (rigid toileting routines), and sensory issues (aversion to the toilet environment).

#### 2.4 Sleep Disorders [2]

- **Sleep disorders** [2]: Affect 50-80% of individuals with ASD.
- **Types**: Sleep onset insomnia (most common), frequent night waking, early morning waking, irregular sleep-wake patterns.
- **Why sleep is disrupted from first principles**:
  - **Melatonin synthesis abnormalities**: Reduced activity of ASMT (acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase), the enzyme converting N-acetylserotonin to melatonin → lower endogenous melatonin → impaired circadian entrainment.
  - **Serotonergic abnormalities**: Serotonin is the precursor to melatonin — if the serotonergic system is dysregulated, melatonin production is affected.
  - **Sensory hypersensitivity**: Difficulty "switching off" in a sensory environment (room too bright, sounds too loud, bedding uncomfortable).
  - **Anxiety and hyperarousal**: The same anxiety that permeates daytime persists at night.
  - **Co-occurring ADHD**: Hyperactivity/restlessness interferes with sleep onset.
- **Impact**: Poor sleep worsens daytime behaviour, attention, learning, mood, and family stress. It is one of the most important modifiable factors in ASD.
- **Management**: Sleep hygiene → melatonin (first-line pharmacotherapy) → treat comorbidities (anxiety, ADHD).

### 3. Neurological Complications

#### 3.1 Seizures / Epilepsy (~20-30%) [2]

- **Seizures (25%): usually develop by adolescence** [2].
- **Bimodal onset**: First peak in early childhood (< 5 years), second peak in adolescence.
- **Risk factors for epilepsy in ASD**: Co-occurring intellectual disability (strongest predictor), female sex, known genetic syndrome (tuberous sclerosis, Fragile X, Angelman), regression.
- **Why epilepsy co-occurs from first principles**: The same neurodevelopmental abnormalities that produce ASD — aberrant neuronal migration, synaptic dysfunction, excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance (GABA/glutamate), cortical malformations — also lower seizure threshold. Tuberous sclerosis (cortical tubers = epileptogenic foci) is a paradigmatic example.
- **Types**: Any seizure type can occur; complex partial seizures and generalised tonic-clonic seizures are most common. Subtle seizure types (absence, myoclonic) may go unrecognised.
- **Management**: Standard AEDs per seizure type. Avoid valproate in females of childbearing age (teratogenic; and notably, prenatal valproate exposure itself increases ASD risk — a cruel irony).

#### 3.2 Catatonia [2]

- **Catatonia-like features, e.g., freezing mid-action, slowing** [2].
- Prevalence: ~12-17% of adolescents/young adults with ASD, more common in those with ID.
- **Features**: Motor immobility (stupor, posturing, catalepsy), mutism, negativism, mannerisms, echolalia/echopraxia, withdrawal.
- **Why catatonia occurs in ASD**: Poorly understood, but possibly related to basal ganglia/frontal dysfunction, GABA-ergic abnormalities, and extreme anxiety/shutdown responses.
- **Importance**: Often misattributed to "just ASD" and therefore undertreated. Must be actively recognised because it responds to treatment (benzodiazepines, ECT in refractory cases).

#### 3.3 Motor Deficits [2]

- **Motor deficits, e.g., abnormal gaits, clumsiness, toe-walking, other abnormal motor signs** [2].
- Dyspraxia (motor planning difficulties), hypotonia, poor balance, fine motor difficulties.
- Impact: Affects handwriting, self-care skills, sports participation, and peer acceptance.

### 4. Physical Health Complications

Individuals with ASD have significant physical health disparities, partly due to communication barriers (can't report symptoms), behavioural barriers (can't cooperate with examinations), and systemic healthcare barriers (health services not adapted for ASD).

| Complication | Prevalence | Why It Occurs |
|---|---|---|
| **GI problems** (constipation, GERD, abdominal pain) | ~30-50% | Food selectivity → low-fibre diet → constipation. Serotonergic abnormalities affect GI motility (90% of body's serotonin is in the gut). Anxiety can exacerbate GI symptoms. |
| **Feeding difficulties / Nutritional deficiency** | Very common | Sensory-driven food selectivity → limited dietary variety → deficiencies in iron, zinc, calcium, vitamins. Obesity from restricted high-calorie diet. |
| **Obesity** | Increased | Food selectivity (often high-carb/processed foods), reduced physical activity (social sports difficult), medication side effects (risperidone, aripiprazole) [2]. |
| **Dental caries** | Increased [2] | Oral sensory aversion → difficulty tolerating tooth-brushing. Food selectivity (sticky/sweet preferences). Difficulty cooperating with dental examinations. |
| **Injuries** | Increased | Impaired safety awareness (especially with ID), self-injurious behaviour, impulsive behaviour (if ADHD comorbid), sensory hyposensitivity to pain. |
| **Premature mortality** | 2-3× population rate | Drowning (wandering + water fascination + reduced safety awareness), epilepsy-related death (SUDEP), accidents, suicide (especially in those without ID). |

<Callout title="Mortality Risk in ASD">

Studies consistently show that individuals with ASD have **2-3 times higher mortality** than the general population. Leading causes include:
- **Epilepsy-related death** (SUDEP, status epilepticus)
- **Drowning** (wandering behaviour + water fascination + reduced safety awareness — this is a leading cause of death in young children with ASD)
- **Suicide** (especially in ASD without intellectual disability — those with sufficient insight to recognise their social struggles but insufficient support)
- **Accidents/injuries**
- **Medical complications** related to co-occurring conditions

This underscores the importance of safety planning (water safety, wandering prevention, seizure management) and mental health monitoring.

### 5. Psychosocial and Functional Complications

These are often the most impactful complications from the patient's and family's perspective.

#### 5.1 Social Isolation and Loneliness

- **Why**: Core social communication deficits → difficulty making and maintaining friendships. **Difficulty making and maintaining peer friendships** [2]. Many individuals with ASD *want* social connection but lack the skills to achieve it, leading to profound loneliness.
- **Impact**: Social isolation is a risk factor for depression, anxiety, and suicidality. Reduced social network means fewer protective factors in times of crisis.

#### 5.2 Bullying and Victimisation

- Individuals with ASD are **4× more likely** to be bullied than neurotypical peers.
- **Why**: Social naivety (can't recognise bullying, manipulation, or sarcasm), difficulty reporting (communication deficits), "different" behaviour that attracts negative attention, reduced peer protection (fewer friends to intervene).
- **Impact**: Compounds social anxiety, depression, school refusal, self-harm.

#### 5.3 Academic Underachievement

- Despite having average or above-average intellectual ability, many individuals with ASD underperform academically due to executive dysfunction, sensory overload in the classroom, social/behavioural difficulties, and inadequate educational support.

#### 5.4 Employment Difficulties

- **Only a minority can live and work independently in adulthood** [2].
- Adults with ASD face significant barriers to employment: social communication difficulties in interviews and workplace dynamics, sensory challenges in work environments, executive dysfunction affecting organisation and time management, stigma and discrimination.
- Unemployment rates for adults with ASD are estimated at 50-80%, even among those with university degrees.

#### 5.5 Relationship and Sexuality Difficulties

- Difficulty understanding social rules of romantic relationships, consent, appropriate behaviour.
- Vulnerability to exploitation (especially in those with ID or social naivety).
- Sensory issues affecting physical intimacy.

#### 5.6 Suicidality

- Adults with ASD (especially those without ID, sometimes called "high-functioning") have significantly elevated rates of suicidal ideation (~66%), suicide attempts (~35%), and completed suicide.
- **Why**: Chronic social isolation, camouflaging exhaustion [2], depression, unemployment, relationship failure, and a sense of being fundamentally "different" without hope of change.
- **Critical implication**: Always screen for suicidality in adolescents and adults with ASD, especially during transitions (school to university, university to employment) and periods of loss.

#### 5.7 Criminal Justice System Involvement

- A minority of individuals with ASD come into contact with the criminal justice system, sometimes due to misunderstanding social rules (e.g., stalking behaviour driven by social naivety rather than malice), rigid rule-following (reporting minor infractions of others), or intense interests that inadvertently cross legal boundaries.
- Vulnerability when in the justice system: difficulty understanding their rights, suggestibility during interview, sensory distress in custody.

---

### 6. Family Impact

ASD does not only affect the individual — it profoundly impacts the entire family system [2]:

| Domain | Impact | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Parental mental health** | Higher rates of depression, anxiety, and chronic stress in parents of children with ASD | Grief at diagnosis, daily caregiving demands, sleep deprivation (child's sleep problems), behavioural challenges, navigating services, financial burden, social stigma |
| **Marital/relationship strain** | Higher divorce rates debated but relationship stress is well-documented | Disagreements about management, unequal caregiving burden, reduced couple time, grief process out of sync |
| **Sibling impact** | Siblings may experience neglect, parentification, embarrassment, or resilience/empathy | Parental attention directed to the child with ASD; sibling may also carry genetic risk for BAP or ASD |
| **Financial burden** | Substantial — therapy costs, reduced parental earning capacity, special schooling | ABA therapy alone can cost HK$500-1500+/hour; many therapies not covered by public health system |
| **Social isolation of the family** | Families may withdraw from social activities due to the child's behavioural difficulties or stigma | Public meltdowns, staring, judgement from others, difficulty arranging childcare |

This is why **family support, psychoeducation, counselling, and practical help** [2] are not optional extras but essential components of ASD management.

### Summary Table — Complications by Category

| Category | Key Complications | Pathophysiological Link |
|---|---|---|
| **Psychiatric** | Anxiety (~40-50%), ADHD (~30-50%), depression (~12-40%), OCD, eating disorders, psychosis | Shared neurobiology; secondary to social stress; serotonergic/dopaminergic dysfunction |
| **Behavioural** | SIB, aggression, soiling/enuresis, sleep disorders [2] | Communication frustration, sensory dysregulation, executive dysfunction, melatonin abnormalities |
| **Neurological** | Seizures (~25%), catatonia, motor deficits [2] | E/I imbalance, aberrant neurodevelopment, basal ganglia/frontal dysfunction |
| **Physical** | GI problems, feeding difficulties, obesity, dental caries, injuries, premature mortality | Sensory selectivity, medication effects, safety awareness deficits, communication barriers |
| **Psychosocial** | Social isolation, bullying, academic underachievement, unemployment, relationship difficulties, suicidality | Cascade from core social communication deficits |
| **Family** | Parental mental health, marital strain, sibling impact, financial burden | Chronic caregiving demands, grief, system navigation |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of ASD">

**Psychiatric comorbidity is the rule** (> 70% lifetime): Anxiety is the most common (~40-50%), followed by ADHD (~30-50%) and depression (especially in adolescence) [2]. Always screen and treat comorbidities — they are often more treatable than core ASD.

**Behavioural**: Self-injurious behaviour, aggression, sleep disorders (~50-80%), soiling/enuresis [2]. Sudden behavioural change = rule out medical cause (pain, seizures, medication side effects).

**Neurological**: Seizures occur in ~25%, usually by adolescence [2], bimodal onset. Risk increases with ID and genetic syndromes. Catatonia in ~12-17% of adolescents/adults — must recognise and treat [2].

**Physical**: GI problems, feeding difficulties, obesity, dental caries, increased injury and premature mortality (2-3×). Drowning is a leading cause of death in young children with ASD.

**Psychosocial**: Social isolation, bullying (4× risk), academic underachievement, unemployment (50-80%), suicidality (elevated in ASD without ID). Only a minority achieve independence in adulthood [2].

**Family impact**: Parental depression/stress, financial burden, sibling effects. Family support is an essential part of management [2].

**Key clinical pearl**: The **most modifiable** complications are psychiatric comorbidities, sleep disturbance, and family support — prioritise these in management.

Executive dysfunction / cognitive inflexibility means any change from routine is experienced as threatening because the individual cannot flexibly adapt. 3. Sensory hypersensitivity means the physical environment itself can feel hostile (loud noises, bright lights, crowds). Additional factors: impaired interoception (difficulty recognising escalating anxiety), increased self-awareness in adolescence leading to awareness of social differences."

      question: "A 14-year-old with ASD and intellectual disability who was previously stable suddenly becomes aggressive, refuses food, and has increased self-injurious behaviour over 3 days. What is your immediate clinical priority and why?",
      markscheme: "Immediate priority is to rule out a medical/physical cause for the behavioural change. In individuals with ASD and ID who cannot verbalise pain, behavioural deterioration IS their communication of distress. Common medical causes: dental pain/caries, otitis media, constipation, GERD, fractures, urinary tract infection, new seizure onset, medication side effects (e.g., akathisia from antipsychotics). Approach: thorough physical examination, review medications, check for constipation, dental examination, consider blood tests and imaging as indicated."

      markscheme: "They have sufficient cognitive ability and self-awareness to recognise their social differences and struggles, yet insufficient natural social skills to overcome them. Contributing factors: chronic social isolation and loneliness despite desire for connection, exhaustion from camouflaging/masking efforts, repeated social failure and rejection leading to learned helplessness, high rates of comorbid depression and anxiety, unemployment despite qualifications, relationship difficulties, and a sense of being fundamentally different without hope of change. Transitions (school to university, university to employment) are particularly high-risk periods."

    {
      question: "Name three reasons why sleep disturbance is so prevalent in ASD and explain the first-line pharmacological treatment.",
      markscheme: "Reasons: (1) Melatonin synthesis abnormalities — reduced ASMT enzyme activity leads to lower endogenous melatonin and impaired circadian entrainment. (2) Sensory hypersensitivity — difficulty settling in a sensory environment (light, sound, texture of bedding). (3) Anxiety/hyperarousal — the chronic anxiety of ASD persists at night. Others: co-occurring ADHD (restlessness), serotonergic abnormalities (serotonin is a melatonin precursor). First-line pharmacological treatment: exogenous melatonin (after optimising sleep hygiene), which directly replaces the deficient endogenous melatonin. Well-studied in ASD with good safety profile."
