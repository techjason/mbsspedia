## Definition

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common, recurrent psychiatric illness characterised by persistent low mood, loss of interest/pleasure (anhedonia), and a constellation of cognitive, biological, and psychomotor disturbances that cause significant functional impairment [1][2].

Let's break the name down:
- **"Major"** – distinguishes it from minor/subthreshold depressive conditions (e.g., adjustment disorder with depressed mood, minor depression)
- **"Depressive"** – from Latin *deprimere* ("to press down") — the mood is pushed down
- **"Disorder"** – a clinically significant syndrome, not just transient sadness

The key conceptual distinction: **MDD is NOT ordinary sadness.** Normal grief and disappointment are time-limited, proportionate to context, and retain emotional reactivity. MDD is pervasive, disproportionate, autonomous (takes on a life of its own), and disrupts biological rhythms (sleep, appetite, energy, psychomotor function) [1][2].

<Callout title="Core Concept">
***Depressive disorder is caused by a combination of biological, social, and psychological factors, which disturb the brain's capacity for stress management*** [3]. It is never "just" a chemical imbalance or "just" a psychological problem — it is always a biopsychosocial condition.

## Epidemiology

### Global Burden
- ***4th leading cause of disability worldwide*** with approximately ***~$85 billion/year loss of productivity*** [2]
- WHO ranks MDD as the single largest contributor to global disability (years lived with disability, YLD) [1]
- Lifetime prevalence: **10–20%** globally [2]
- 12-month prevalence: ~7% in Western populations; varies by country

### Hong Kong-Specific Data
- ***2.9% prevalence in Hong Kong*** (Hong Kong Mental Morbidity Survey, HKMMS) [2][4]
- This is likely an underestimate due to:
  - Stigma around mental illness in Chinese culture → under-reporting
  - Tendency to present with **somatic complaints** rather than mood symptoms (somatisation)
  - Under-recognition in primary care
- Increasing trend over time [2]

### Demographics
- ***Mean age of onset ≈ 27 years***, ***commonest in 18–44 year age group*** [2]
- ***↑ in females (2–3×)***, ***unemployed***, ***divorced*** [2]
- Reasons for female preponderance are uncertain. Postulated reasons include [2]:
  1. Greater readiness of women to admit depressive symptoms
  2. Misdiagnosis as alcohol-related disorder in men (due to higher rates of comorbid alcohol abuse)
  3. Social disadvantages in women
  4. Female hormones may sensitise the brain to effects of stress
- ***↑ comorbidity with other disorders, especially anxiety and substance abuse*** [2]

### Non-Psychiatric Impact of Depression
Depression is NOT just a "mood problem" — it has systemic medical consequences [2]:
- ***↑ Morbidity***: associated with ↓ birth weight, chronic medical illness, poor self-perceived health, functional and cognitive impairment
- ***↑ Mortality***: ***RR 1.2–4.0× non-suicide mortality*** [2]
  - Why? Behavioural risk factors (poor treatment adherence, inactivity, ↑ alcohol), biological risk factors (altered thrombogenesis, HPA axis dysregulation → cardiovascular risk), and subclinical/prevalent disease (CVS diseases) [2]

<Callout title="High Yield – Depression Kills Beyond Suicide">
Depression independently increases cardiovascular mortality. A depressed patient post-MI has roughly 3–4× the mortality of a non-depressed patient. Always think of depression as a systemic illness, not just a "mental" one.

## Risk Factors

Organised using the **biopsychosocial model** and the **predisposing–precipitating–perpetuating (3P)** framework:

### Predisposing Factors (Vulnerability)

| Domain | Risk Factor | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| **Genetic** | ***Threefold increase in risk among first-degree relatives*** [3] | Twin studies show **37% heritability** (50% MZ concordance — lower than schizophrenia/bipolar) [2]. Probably multiple genes with small individual effects and complex gene-environment interactions. Candidate gene includes ***serotonin transporter*** (5-HTTLPR variant) [2][3] |
| **Personality** | ***Neuroticism***, ***sociotropy*** (strong need for approval), personality disorders (borderline, obsessive-compulsive) [2][3] | Neuroticism is associated with depression and may represent a milder form of the disease [2]. Sociotropy means the person's self-worth depends on others' approval → vulnerable to interpersonal loss |
| ***Early environment*** | ***Parental separation, physical and sexual abuse, non-caring or overprotective parenting styles*** [3] | These create insecure attachment styles and maladaptive cognitive schemas (Beck's model) that persist into adulthood |
| **Social** | ***Lack of supportive networks, poorly functioning relationships, poor social integration*** [3] | Chronic stressors: not having employment outside home, raising young children [2] |
| **Female sex** | 2–3× risk [2] | Hormonal, social, and reporting-bias factors (see above) |

### Precipitating Factors (Triggers)

- ***Stress and trauma: long-term difficulties, recent life events (in particular events that lead to feelings of **entrapment** and **humiliation**)*** [3]
- **↑ 6× risk** of adverse life events before onset of MDD [2]
- Especially common in **losses** (bereavement, breakup), **entrapment**, and **humiliation** (e.g., bullying) [2]
- Less important in **established melancholic depression** and **strong family history** (? ↓ threshold for spontaneous episodes) [2]
- **Medical illnesses** can act as *non-specific stressors* or cause depression via *physiological mechanisms* (e.g., Cushing's disease, puerperium, hypothyroidism) [2]

### Perpetuating Factors (Maintaining)

- Ongoing psychosocial stressors (poverty, abusive relationship, chronic pain)
- Cognitive distortions (see Cognitive Theory below)
- Substance misuse (alcohol is a depressant → vicious cycle)
- Non-adherence to treatment
- Social isolation and withdrawal (symptom becomes perpetuator)
- Comorbid medical illness

## Anatomy & Functional Neuroanatomy

Understanding the neuroanatomy helps you understand *why* specific symptoms occur:

### Key Brain Regions in Depression

| Region | Normal Function | Change in MDD | Clinical Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) – Ventromedial** | Emotional and social regulatory functions, valuation, decision-making | ***↑ Activity*** [2] | ***↑ Sensitivity to pain, anxiety, depressive ruminations, tension*** [2] |
| **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) – Dorsolateral** | Executive functions (planning, working memory, attention) | ***↓ Activity*** [2] | ***Psychomotor retardation, apathy, deficits in attention/working memory*** [2] |
| **Amygdala** | Threat detection, emotional memory, fear processing | ↑ Reactivity, ↑ connectivity with vmPFC | Hypervigilance to negative stimuli, negative emotional bias, anxiety |
| **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)** | Error monitoring, emotional regulation, conflict resolution | Altered connectivity with amygdala | ***Disrupted inhibitory action in emotional regulation*** [2] — the "brake" on negative emotions is weakened |
| **Hippocampus** | Memory consolidation, contextual memory, HPA axis feedback inhibition | ***Reduced volume*** [2][3] | Both a ***predisposing factor*** and a ***consequence*** of depression [2]. Smaller hippocampus → less effective HPA axis negative feedback → cortisol stays high → more hippocampal damage (vicious cycle) |
| ***Subgenual cortex*** | Mood regulation, autonomic function | ***Volume reduction and decreased quantity of glial cells*** [3] | Contributes to autonomic dysregulation and persistent low mood |
| **Mesolimbic dopamine pathway** (VTA → nucleus accumbens) | Reward, motivation, pleasure | ↓ Dopaminergic activity | Anhedonia, amotivation, loss of pleasure response |

### Monoamine Pathways

The three monoamine systems implicated in depression originate from brainstem nuclei that belong to the **reticular activating system (RAS)** [2]:

1. **Serotonin (5-HT)** — from **dorsal raphe nuclei**
   - ***Affects body temperature, regulates sleep and wakefulness, mood and impulse control*** [3]
   - ***Low levels of serotonin metabolites found in the brains of suicide decedents and spinal fluids of depressed patients*** [3]
   
2. **Noradrenaline (NE)** — from **locus coeruleus**
   - ***Regulates mood and anxiety levels*** [3]
   - ***Mood symptoms emerged among patients who took propranolol*** (beta-blocker) [3]
   
3. **Dopamine (DA)** — from **ventral tegmental area (VTA)**
   - ***Regulates motor and mental activity, attention and motivation*** [3]
   - ***Dopaminergic neurons in the mesolimbic reward pathway play an important role in motivation, reinforcement, and the pleasure response*** [3]
   - ***However, they are diminished in the brains of suicidal decedents with depression*** [3]

These neurones regulate **global behavioural states** — sleep-wake cycle, appetite, motor activity, learning and memory, emotional processes [2]. This is why depression disrupts so many different functions simultaneously.

---

## Aetiology & Pathophysiology

<Callout title="Key Principle">
***The pathophysiology of depression remains largely unknown. Several mechanisms have been proposed*** [3]. No single theory explains everything — think of these as complementary layers that converge on a final common pathway of disrupted mood regulation.
</Callout>

### 1. Biological Hypotheses

#### A. Monoamine Hypothesis (Classical)

***Classical "serotonin hypothesis": diminished activity of serotonin pathways plays a causal role in the pathophysiology of depression*** [3]

Historical evidence:
- ***Antihypertensive drug reserpine, which depleted monoamine, produced a depressive state*** [3]
- ***Diminished monoaminergic activity was detected in the brains of decedents of suicide and the bodily fluids of people with depression*** (Coppen, 1967) [3]
- Drugs that increase monoamine availability (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs) improve depression

However: ***Evidence suggests that the cause of depression is far more complicated than a reduced level of serotonin*** [3]
- SSRIs increase synaptic serotonin within hours, but clinical improvement takes 2–6 weeks → suggests downstream neuroplastic changes are the real mechanism
- Direct tryptophan depletion (reducing serotonin precursor) does NOT reliably cause depression in healthy volunteers
- Monoamine deficiency is likely a **contributory factor** rather than the sole cause

***Monoamines including serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine are relevant to mood regulation, and play an essential role in the regulation of other bodily function*** [3]

***Besides, abnormalities in glutamate, GABA, and substance P have been detected in patients with depression*** [3]
- Glutamate (excitatory): excessive glutamatergic signalling may contribute to neuronal damage; this is why **ketamine** (NMDA receptor antagonist) has rapid antidepressant effects
- GABA (inhibitory): reduced GABAergic tone may contribute to anxiety and agitation in depression
- Substance P: neuropeptide involved in pain and stress signalling

#### B. Genetic Factors

- ***A threefold increase in risk of depression among first-degree relatives compared to the general population*** [3]
- **37% heritability** from twin studies (50% MZ concordance) [2]
- Lower than schizophrenia (~80%) and bipolar (~85%) → environment plays a larger relative role
- Probably **polygenic** — multiple genes with small individual effects [2]
- Key candidate: ***serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR)*** — short allele associated with depression in the presence of life stress (gene × environment interaction) [2][3]
- The 5-HTTLPR variant is also associated with early-onset depression in the presence of adversities [2]

#### C. Structural Brain Changes

- ***Volume reduction and decreased quantity of glial cells in subgenual cortex*** [3]
- ***Reduced hippocampal size*** [3]
- Hippocampal volume reduction is both a predisposing factor and a consequence of depression [2]
  - Chronic cortisol elevation → glucocorticoid-mediated neurotoxicity → hippocampal atrophy → impaired HPA negative feedback → more cortisol → vicious cycle

#### D. Hormonal/Neuroendocrine Changes

***Hormonal changes in depression*** [3]:
- ***Dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis*** — hypercortisolaemia is one of the most robust biological findings in MDD
  - Why? Chronic stress → ↑ CRH from hypothalamus → ↑ ACTH from pituitary → ↑ cortisol from adrenals → hippocampal atrophy → impaired negative feedback → cortisol stays high
  - This explains the link between Cushing's disease and depression
- ***Lower estradiol (in women) and testosterone (in men)*** — explains perimenopausal depression and depression in hypogonadal men
- ***Decreased triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)*** — subclinical hypothyroidism is strongly associated with depression; T3 augmentation is sometimes used in treatment-resistant depression
- ***Diminished BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) level*** — BDNF supports neuronal survival, growth, and synaptic plasticity. Low BDNF → impaired neuroplasticity → neurons cannot adapt to stress. Antidepressants and exercise both increase BDNF.

#### E. Neuroinflammation (Emerging Theory)

- Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) found in MDD
- Inflammation activates the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which shunts tryptophan away from serotonin synthesis toward kynurenine (neurotoxic) pathway
- This connects depression with chronic inflammatory conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, IBD, cardiovascular disease)
- Explains why IFN-α therapy for hepatitis C commonly causes depression

### 2. Psychosocial Hypotheses

#### A. Cognitive Theory (Aaron Beck)

***Cognitive theory: cognitive distortions*** are prominent in depression and are targeted in CBT [2][3]:

| Cognitive Distortion | Chinese | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Selective abstraction*** | ***斷章取義*** | ***Focusing on a detail and ignoring more important features of a situation*** | A student gets 9/10 on an exam and fixates on the one wrong answer |
| ***Overgeneralisation*** | ***以偏概全*** | ***Drawing a general conclusion on the basis of a single incident*** | "I failed one test, so I'm a total failure" |
| ***Personalisation*** | ***過度自責*** | ***Relating external events to oneself in an unwarranted way*** | "My friend looks unhappy — it must be because of something I did" |
| ***Arbitrary inference*** | ***妄下判斷*** | ***Drawing a conclusion when there is no evidence for it and even some evidence against it*** | "My boss didn't say good morning — he must be planning to fire me" |

Beck's **Cognitive Triad** — the depressed person has negative automatic thoughts about:
1. **The self** — "I am worthless"
2. **The world** — "Everything is terrible"
3. **The future** — "Nothing will ever get better" (hopelessness)

These distortions arise from **negative schemas** (core beliefs) formed in early life, activated by stressful events → maintain and deepen the depressive episode.

#### B. Psychoanalytic Theory

- ***Psychoanalytical theory: loss of an 'object', insecure attachments*** [3]
- Freud proposed that depression represents anger turned inward after loss of a loved one (real or symbolic)
- While the specific Freudian mechanisms are debated, the general concept that **early attachment disruption predisposes to depression** is well-supported

#### C. Learned Helplessness (Seligman)

- When an organism repeatedly experiences uncontrollable adverse events, it stops trying to escape even when escape becomes possible
- Translates to the passivity, hopelessness, and "giving up" seen in depression
- Neurobiologically linked to prefrontal cortex hypoactivity and HPA axis dysregulation

## Classification

### ICD-11 vs DSM-5-TR Classification

| Feature | ICD-11 | DSM-5-TR |
|---|---|---|
| Single episode | Single episode depressive disorder | Major Depressive Disorder, single episode |
| Recurrent | Recurrent depressive disorder | Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent |
| Severity | Mild / Moderate / Severe | Mild / Moderate / Severe |
| With psychotic features | With psychotic symptoms | With psychotic features |
| Persistent | Dysthymic disorder | Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) |
| Other | — | Other Specified Depressive Disorder |

### Severity Specifiers

Based on number of symptoms, symptom intensity, and functional impairment:
- **Mild**: Few, if any, symptoms beyond minimum criteria; minor functional impairment
- **Moderate**: Symptoms and functional impairment between mild and severe
- **Severe**: Most symptoms present, marked functional impairment; may have psychotic features

### Important Subtypes/Specifiers

| Subtype | Key Features | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **Melancholic** ("biological" depression) | Profound anhedonia, worse in AM, early morning wakening, psychomotor disturbance, weight loss, guilt | Better response to biological treatments (antidepressants, ECT) |
| **Atypical** | Mood reactivity (can brighten temporarily), hypersomnia, hyperphagia/weight gain, leaden paralysis, interpersonal rejection sensitivity | Better response to MAOIs and SSRIs (historically) |
| **Psychotic** | Delusions and/or hallucinations (usually mood-congruent: guilt, worthlessness, nihilism, somatic) | Requires antipsychotic + antidepressant or ECT |
| **Seasonal** (SAD) | ***Recurrent onset in autumn/winter, recovery in spring/summer*** [2] | ***Postulated to be related to daylight duration*** → bright light therapy [2] |
| **Recurrent brief** | ***Recurrent episodes of 2–7 days occurring once a month*** [2] | Often missed because episodes are too short for MDD criteria |
| **Peripartum onset** | Onset during pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum | Screen all peripartum women; risk to mother and infant |
| **With anxious distress** | Prominent anxiety symptoms within depressive episode | Poorer prognosis, higher suicide risk |

### Related Depressive Disorders

- ***Dysthymia (Persistent Depressive Disorder)***: Persistent depressive symptoms NOT meeting full criteria for ≥ 2 years. Usual onset in early adulthood. May be associated with superimposed major depressive episodes (***"double depression"***) [2]
  - Lifetime risk ~4%, higher in women and divorced [2]

- ***Minor anxiety-depressive (affective) disorders***: Very commonly seen in primary care (6.9% prevalence). Commonly present with ***prominent somatic symptoms***. Mood symptoms (anxiety, depression, irritability) + somatic symptoms (fatigue, insomnia, bodily preoccupation) + cognitive symptoms (poor concentration) [2]

<Callout title="Exam Tip" type="idea">
***Current DSM/ICD classification uses a combination of the above features*** [2]. You need to know both the categorical diagnosis AND the specifiers. A complete diagnosis reads like: "Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with melancholic features."

## Clinical Features

### How to Think About This

The clinical features of MDD are best understood through the lens of the affected neurotransmitter systems and brain regions. Every symptom has a pathophysiological basis.

### A. Core Features (At Least One Required)

#### 1. Depressed Mood

- ***Differs from ordinary sadness: miserable, dejected, 'down in the dumps'*** [2]
- ***Pervasive: covers most period of the day*** [2]
- ***Loss of reactivity: loss of normal ups and downs in response to circumstances*** [2]
  - Pathophysiology: Reflects impaired serotonergic and dopaminergic modulation of emotional processing. The ventromedial PFC is hyperactive (excessive rumination, negative bias) while the dorsolateral PFC is hypoactive (cannot override negative emotion with rational thought)
- ***Morning dysphoria: characteristically worse in the morning*** (one of the "biological" symptoms) [2]
  - Why morning? Cortisol normally peaks in the early morning (cortisol awakening response). In depression, the HPA axis is dysregulated with exaggerated cortisol peaks → worst mood at peak cortisol time. This improves slightly as the day progresses.

> **ICD-11 cardinal symptom**: ***Depressed mood occurring most of the day, nearly every day during a period lasting at least two weeks*** [3]

#### 2. Anhedonia (Loss of Interest and Pleasure)

- ***Anhedonia: lack of interest and enjoyment*** [2]
- ***Loss of ability to derive pleasure from activities that were formerly enjoyed*** [2]
- ***Associated with social withdrawal*** [2]
- Pathophysiology: Dopaminergic hypofunction in the **mesolimbic reward pathway** (VTA → nucleus accumbens). This pathway normally mediates the "wanting" (motivation) and "liking" (pleasure) components of reward. In depression, both are diminished → the patient cannot feel pleasure even from things they previously loved.

> **ICD-11 cardinal symptom**: ***Diminished interest in activities occurring most of the day, nearly every day during a period lasting at least two weeks*** [3]

#### 3. Anergia (Lack of Energy)

- ***Anergia: lack of energy or ↑ fatigability on minimal exertion → ↓ activity*** [2]
- Pathophysiology: Multifactorial — noradrenergic hypofunction (NE regulates arousal and energy), HPA axis dysregulation (chronic cortisol elevation leads to metabolic exhaustion), and reduced dopaminergic drive (motivation deficit)

### B. Biological (Somatic/Melancholic) Symptoms

These are the "vegetative" symptoms — they reflect disruption of basic biological rhythms controlled by the hypothalamus and brainstem monoamine systems:

#### 1. Sleep Disturbances

- ***Most classically early morning wakening*** (waking 2+ hours before usual time and unable to return to sleep) [2]
  - Why early morning wakening specifically? The sleep-wake cycle is regulated by serotonin (dorsal raphe) and noradrenaline (locus coeruleus). In melancholic depression, there is premature activation of the arousal system. Also, cortisol peaks earlier in depressed patients → earlier awakening.
- **Initial insomnia** (difficulty falling asleep) — especially when comorbid anxiety
- **Middle insomnia** (frequent nocturnal awakenings)
- **Hypersomnia** (in atypical depression) — sleeping excessively but never feeling rested
- Polysomnography findings: ↓ REM latency (enter REM sleep faster), ↑ REM density, ↓ slow-wave (deep) sleep

#### 2. Appetite and Weight Changes

- **↓ Appetite and weight loss** (typical/melancholic) — serotonin normally stimulates appetite via hypothalamus; 5-HT dysregulation → appetite suppression
- **↑ Appetite and weight gain** (atypical) — carbohydrate craving, comfort eating; may relate to insulin resistance and leptin dysregulation in the context of HPA axis dysfunction
- Clinically significant = ≥ 5% body weight change in one month

#### 3. Psychomotor Disturbance

- **Psychomotor retardation** (more common in melancholic):
  - Slowed movements, reduced gestures, soft/monotonous speech, increased response latency
  - Pathophysiology: Dorsolateral PFC hypoactivity + dopaminergic hypofunction → reduced motor planning and execution
- **Psychomotor agitation** (more common in anxious/mixed depression):
  - Restlessness, pacing, hand-wringing, inability to sit still
  - Reflects noradrenergic hyperactivation ± anxiety component
- These are **observable signs**, not just subjective complaints

#### 4. Diurnal Mood Variation

- Mood characteristically worst in the morning and improves somewhat towards evening (as described above under morning dysphoria)
- A "biological" marker of melancholic depression

#### 5. Loss of Libido

- ↓ Sexual interest and function
- Pathophysiology: Both serotonergic and dopaminergic dysfunction affect sexual desire and arousal. Also, ↓ testosterone/estradiol contributes [3]

### C. Cognitive Symptoms

#### 1. Poor Concentration and Indecisiveness

- ***Difficulty concentrating*** [3]
- Patients describe "can't think straight," "mind goes blank," "can't make decisions"
- Pathophysiology: Dorsolateral PFC hypoactivity → executive dysfunction. Also, rumination (vmPFC hyperactivity) hijacks cognitive resources
- In elderly patients, this can be so severe as to mimic dementia → **"pseudodementia"** (depressive pseudodementia)

#### 2. Negative Cognitions

- ***Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt*** [3]
  - Guilt may reach delusional proportions in severe depression ("I have committed unforgivable sins")
  - Pathophysiology: Cognitive distortions (Beck) — personalisation, selective abstraction
- ***Hopelessness*** [3]
  - "Nothing will ever get better" — the most dangerous cognitive feature because it is the strongest predictor of suicide
  - Reflects the "future" component of Beck's cognitive triad

#### 3. Suicidal Ideation

- ***Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide*** [3]
  - Ranges from passive ("I wish I were dead," "my family would be better off without me") to active (specific plans, means, intent)
  - Must be systematically assessed in every depressed patient
  - Pathophysiology: Hopelessness + impaired serotonergic function (5-HT is involved in impulse control) → reduced capacity to inhibit self-destructive impulses

### D. Psychotic Features (in Severe Depression)

- Occur in **~15–20%** of severe depressive episodes
- Usually **mood-congruent** (content consistent with depressive themes):
  - **Delusions of guilt** ("I have caused terrible harm")
  - **Delusions of worthlessness** ("I am nothing")
  - **Nihilistic delusions** ("I am already dead," "my organs are rotting" — Cotard's syndrome)
  - **Delusions of poverty** ("I have lost everything")
  - **Somatic delusions** ("I have cancer/AIDS")
  - **Persecutory delusions** ("I deserve to be punished")
  - **Auditory hallucinations** (usually second-person derogatory voices — "you are worthless")
- Mood-incongruent psychotic features are possible but should raise suspicion for schizoaffective disorder

<Callout title="Psychotic Depression vs Schizophrenia" type="error">
A common exam mistake: Psychotic features IN depression are **mood-congruent** and occur **during the depressive episode only**. In schizoaffective disorder, psychotic symptoms (delusions/hallucinations) are less mood-congruent and may occur **outside** mood episodes. In schizophrenia, mood symptoms are secondary and brief relative to the psychotic illness.
</Callout>

### E. Anxiety Features

- Extremely common comorbidity (~60-70% of MDD patients have significant anxiety)
- Manifests as: worry, tension, restlessness, somatic anxiety symptoms (palpitations, sweating, GI disturbance)
- "Anxious distress" specifier in DSM-5-TR — associated with poorer prognosis and higher suicide risk
- Pathophysiology: Amygdala hyperreactivity + impaired prefrontal inhibition + noradrenergic and serotonergic dysfunction

### F. Somatic Complaints

- ***Commonly present with prominent somatic symptoms*** to healthcare [2]
- Especially important in **Hong Kong and East Asian populations** where somatisation of psychological distress is common
- Common presentations:
  - Headache, backache, generalised body aches
  - GI symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, constipation)
  - Chest tightness, palpitations
  - Dizziness, fatigue
- Pathophysiology: Central sensitisation — serotonin and noradrenaline modulate descending pain inhibitory pathways. In depression, reduced monoaminergic activity → impaired pain inhibition → amplified somatic signals. This is why SNRIs (duloxetine) are used for both depression and chronic pain.

### Summary Table: Symptoms Mapped to Neurobiology

| Symptom Cluster | Key Neurotransmitter/Region | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Depressed mood, guilt, rumination | 5-HT ↓, vmPFC ↑ | Negative emotional bias, excessive self-referential processing |
| Anhedonia, amotivation | DA ↓ (mesolimbic pathway) | Impaired reward processing |
| Anergia, fatigue | NE ↓, DA ↓ | Reduced arousal and drive |
| Sleep disturbance | 5-HT ↓, NE dysregulation | Disrupted sleep-wake regulation, premature RAS activation |
| Appetite/weight change | 5-HT ↓, hypothalamic dysfunction | Disrupted feeding centres |
| Psychomotor retardation | DA ↓, dlPFC ↓ | Reduced motor planning/execution |
| Poor concentration | NE ↓, dlPFC ↓ | Executive dysfunction |
| Suicidal ideation | 5-HT ↓ (impulse control) + hopelessness | Impaired behavioural inhibition + cognitive distortion |
| Somatic symptoms | 5-HT ↓, NE ↓ | Impaired descending pain inhibition |

| **Cognition** | Impaired attention and concentration; may mimic dementia in elderly ("pseudodementia") | dlPFC hypoactivity, hippocampal dysfunction |
| **Insight** | Variable — some fully aware of illness, others may lack insight (especially in psychotic depression) | |
| **Judgement** | Impaired — especially regarding self-harm risk | |

## Assessment

***Assessment*** involves [3]:

1. ***History, including medical and medication history*** — especially look for:
   - Secondary causes (medical conditions, medications)
   - Substance use
   - Past psychiatric history (previous episodes → recurrent MDD vs single episode)
   - Family psychiatric history
   - **Suicide risk assessment** (MUST do in every patient)

2. ***Mental state examination***

3. ***Use of standardised instruments*** — e.g., PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), BDI (Beck Depression Inventory), HAM-D (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale)

4. ***Physical examination & investigation to rule out medical conditions that may cause depressive symptoms*** [3]:
   - ***Basic: CBP, R/LFT, thyroid function test***
   - ***Others: blood alcohol level, blood and urine toxicology screen, HIV test, cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test (for Addison disease), EEG (for epilepsy) or CT or MRI (for organic brain syndrome or hypopituitarism) should be considered if indicated by history taking and physical examination*** [3]

<Callout title="Always Exclude Organic Causes" type="error">
Before diagnosing MDD, you MUST rule out: hypothyroidism (TFT), Cushing's/Addison's, anaemia (CBP), hepatic/renal failure (LFT/RFT), substance use, medication side effects (beta-blockers, steroids, interferon), and intracranial pathology. A "psychiatric" diagnosis is always a diagnosis of exclusion of organic causes.
</Callout>

### Secondary Causes of Depression to Exclude

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Neurological** | Head trauma, stroke, multiple sclerosis, neurodegeneration (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's), brain tumours |
| **Metabolic/Endocrine** | Thyroid disease, Cushing's/Addison's, vitamin deficiency (B12, folate, D), parathyroid disorders |
| **Other medical** | Systemic infections, pancreatic cancer, CHF, MI, chronic pain states |
| **Medications** | Antihypertensives (beta-blockers, methyldopa), neurological drugs (L-dopa, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics), steroids, OCP, opiates, indomethacin, ***interferon*** |
| **Substances** | Alcohol, cannabis, stimulant withdrawal, opioid withdrawal |

      question: "Name the three monoamine neurotransmitters implicated in the monoamine hypothesis of depression and state one specific function each regulates.",
      markscheme: "Serotonin (5-HT): mood, impulse control, sleep-wake cycle. Noradrenaline (NE): mood, anxiety levels, arousal. Dopamine (DA): motivation, reward/pleasure, motor activity. Must name all three with at least one function each.",
    },
    {
      question: "Explain why early morning wakening is the classical sleep disturbance in melancholic depression.",
      markscheme: "In depression, HPA axis is dysregulated with exaggerated early-morning cortisol peak (cortisol awakening response). Premature activation of arousal systems (locus coeruleus/RAS) due to serotonergic and noradrenergic dysfunction leads to early awakening. Mood is also worst in the morning correlating with cortisol peak.",
    },
    {
      question: "List Beck's cognitive triad and name four cognitive distortions seen in depression.",
      markscheme: "Cognitive triad: negative view of (1) self, (2) world, (3) future. Four distortions: selective abstraction, overgeneralisation, personalisation, arbitrary inference.",
    },
    {
      question: "A 45-year-old woman presents with low mood and fatigue. What basic investigations would you order to exclude organic causes of depression?",
      markscheme: "CBP (anaemia), renal function tests, liver function tests, thyroid function tests (hypothyroidism). Consider: blood glucose, calcium/phosphate (parathyroid), vitamin B12/folate, cortisol/ACTH stim test if Addison suspected, urine drug screen. CT/MRI brain if focal neurology or suspicion of organic brain syndrome.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the pathophysiological basis of anhedonia in MDD? Which neural pathway is primarily involved?",
      markscheme: "Anhedonia results from dopaminergic hypofunction in the mesolimbic reward pathway (VTA to nucleus accumbens). This pathway mediates motivation (wanting) and pleasure (liking). Diminished dopaminergic neurotransmission reduces the capacity to experience reward and pleasure from previously enjoyable activities.",
    },
    {
      question: "Differentiate psychotic depression from schizoaffective disorder in terms of the relationship between mood and psychotic symptoms.",
      markscheme: "In psychotic depression: psychotic features are mood-congruent (guilt, nihilism, worthlessness themes) and occur ONLY during the depressive episode. In schizoaffective disorder: psychotic symptoms are less mood-congruent and may occur OUTSIDE mood episodes (at least 2 weeks of delusions/hallucinations without prominent mood symptoms). Must have concurrent mood + psychotic symptoms at some point.",
