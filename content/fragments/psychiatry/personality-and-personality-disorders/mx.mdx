## Management of Personality Disorders

### Overarching Philosophy: Why Is This Different from Treating Other Psychiatric Conditions?

Managing personality disorders requires a fundamentally different mindset compared to, say, prescribing an SSRI for depression or an antipsychotic for schizophrenia. Here's why:

1. **Personality is the person, not the illness.** You're not trying to eliminate symptoms the way you'd eliminate a delusion. You're trying to help someone **live more adaptively with who they are** [2].

2. **The aim is not "cure" but adaptation.** As stated in the management principles: ***Aim: seek a way of life that conflicts less with their character, often by ↓contact with situations provoking difficulties and ↑opportunity to develop assets in their personality*** [2].

3. ***Psychological support is the mainstay***, with multidisciplinary input [2]. Medications are adjuncts, not primary treatments.

4. ***Drugs: as adjunct only to treat comorbid psychiatric disorders*** [2]. There is no medication "approved" for any personality disorder itself.

5. ***Evidence: little hard evidence to support current management, mainly focusing on Cluster B*** [2]. Most of the treatment evidence base centres on borderline personality disorder.

6. The therapeutic relationship itself is both the **tool** and the **battlefield** — personality pathology plays out directly in the patient-clinician relationship (transference, countertransference, splitting of clinical teams), making treatment both challenging and informative.

### 1. General Principles of Management

Before discussing specific modalities, let's establish the principles that govern ALL personality disorder management [2]:

| Principle | Explanation | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Psychotherapy is the mainstay** | ***Psychological support as mainstay, with multidisciplinary input*** [2] | Personality disorders are disorders of psychological functioning — they respond to psychological interventions, not primarily to medications |
| **Medications are adjuncts only** | ***Drugs: as adjunct only to treat comorbid psychiatric disorders*** [2] | No medication has been shown to treat the core personality pathology itself; medications target specific symptom domains (mood instability, impulsivity, transient psychosis) or comorbid Axis I disorders |
| **Aim for adaptation, not cure** | ***Seek a way of life that conflicts less with their character*** [2] | Personality is enduring — the goal is to help patients function better, not to fundamentally change who they are |
| **Assess strengths and weaknesses** | Part of the assessment framework → ***important in subsequent treatment*** [2] | Treatment is built on the patient's existing strengths. A patient who is intellectually curious (strength) but socially avoidant (weakness) can be engaged through psychoeducation |
| **Multidisciplinary team approach** | Involves psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nurse, social worker, occupational therapist | PDs affect multiple life domains; no single professional can address all needs |
| **Be mindful of the therapeutic relationship** | ***Cluster B → difficult relationship with clinicians → often excluded from care*** [2] | Splitting, idealization/devaluation, manipulation can all play out with clinicians. Consistent boundaries and team communication are essential |
| **Long-term perspective** | Treatment is measured in years, not weeks | Personality is enduring — meaningful change takes time |

<Callout title="The Single Most Important Point">
***Psychotherapy: psychodynamic, cognitive therapy when well-motivated + stable*** [2]. The prerequisite "well-motivated and stable" is crucial — you cannot do intensive psychotherapy with someone who is actively in crisis, intoxicated, or has no motivation to change. Stabilize first, then treat.
</Callout>

### 2. Psychotherapeutic Modalities (The Core of Treatment)

#### 2.1 Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT)

**What it is**: "Dialectical" = "dialectic" from Greek *dialektikḗ* = the art of arriving at truth through opposing arguments. The "dialectic" in DBT is the balance between **acceptance** (mindfulness, validation) and **change** (behavioural modification, skill-building).

**Developed by**: Marsha Linehan, specifically for **Borderline Personality Disorder**.

**Theoretical basis**: Linehan's biosocial model — BPD arises from the interaction of biological emotional vulnerability and an invalidating environment. The treatment therefore addresses both:
- **Acceptance** strategies: mindfulness, validation of the patient's emotional experience (correcting the invalidation)
- **Change** strategies: CBT-based skills for emotional regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness

**Structure**:
- **Individual therapy** (weekly, 1 hour): Addresses the patient's specific problems using a target hierarchy (life-threatening behaviours → therapy-interfering behaviours → quality of life issues)
- **Skills group** (weekly, 2-2.5 hours): Teaches four skill modules:
  1. **Mindfulness**: Core awareness skills — observe, describe, participate without judgment
  2. **Distress tolerance**: Crisis survival skills — self-soothing, distraction, "TIPP" (Temperature, Intense exercise, Paced breathing, Progressive relaxation)
  3. **Emotional regulation**: Understanding, labelling, and modifying emotional responses
  4. **Interpersonal effectiveness**: Asking for what you need, saying no, maintaining self-respect in relationships
- **Phone coaching**: Between sessions for real-time crisis support
- **Therapist consultation team**: Mutual support for therapists treating this demanding population

**Indications**:
- ***Borderline personality disorder*** — gold standard, strongest evidence base [2][18]
- BPD with chronic suicidality and self-harm (primary target)
- Substance use disorders with emotional dysregulation
- Eating disorders with BPD features

**Contraindications/limitations**:
- Requires **high commitment** (~1 year minimum programme)
- Patient must be **willing and able to attend** regularly
- Not effective if patient is **actively psychotic** or **severely cognitively impaired**
- Resource-intensive (requires trained therapists, team structure)

**Evidence**: Strong RCT evidence for ↓self-harm, ↓suicide attempts, ↓hospitalization, ↓emergency department visits, ↑emotional regulation in BPD.

> ***Dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) with mixture of CBT (to ↑emotional regulation) and mindfulness (to ↑awareness) with confrontation*** [2]

#### 2.2 Mentalization-Based Therapy (MBT)

**What it is**: "Mentalization" = the capacity to understand behaviour in terms of underlying **mental states** (thoughts, feelings, desires, intentions) — both your own and others'.

**Developed by**: Anthony Bateman and Peter Fonagy, for **Borderline Personality Disorder**.

**Theoretical basis**: BPD patients have **impaired mentalizing capacity** — under stress, they lose the ability to reflect on their own and others' mental states, leading to impulsive actions, misinterpretations, and interpersonal chaos. This impairment stems from early attachment disruption.

**Structure**:
- Combination of **individual** and **group** therapy
- Originally delivered in a **partial hospitalization / day unit** setting (therapeutic community model)
- Now also delivered in outpatient format
- Duration: typically 18 months

> ***Mentalization: day units to build therapeutic communities designed to help patient become more fully aware of their thoughts/feelings before acting on them*** [2]

**How it works**:
- Therapist adopts a curious, "not-knowing" stance
- Focuses on **current mental states** rather than past events
- When mentalizing breaks down (e.g., patient acts impulsively), the therapist helps restore the capacity to think about thinking
- Avoids deep interpretation (unlike psychoanalysis) — focuses on the process of understanding, not the content

**Indications**:
- Borderline personality disorder (strong evidence base, comparable to DBT)
- Antisocial PD (emerging evidence, particularly from Fonagy's group)
- Young people with emerging personality pathology

**Contraindications/limitations**:
- Active psychosis
- Severe cognitive impairment
- Active substance intoxication (can't mentalize if intoxicated)
- Requires trained therapists and structured programme

#### 2.3 Schema Therapy

**What it is**: "Schema" = Greek *skhêma* = form/pattern. Schema therapy targets **early maladaptive schemas** — deep, pervasive patterns/themes about oneself and relationships that develop in childhood and are elaborated throughout life.

**Developed by**: Jeffrey Young, as an integrative approach combining elements of CBT, psychodynamic, attachment, and Gestalt therapy.

**Theoretical basis**: Personality disorders arise from unmet core emotional needs in childhood → development of early maladaptive schemas (e.g., "I am defective," "I will always be abandoned," "Others are dangerous") → maladaptive coping modes (surrender, avoidance, overcompensation).

**Key concepts**:
- **18 Early Maladaptive Schemas** organized into 5 domains (Disconnection/Rejection, Impaired Autonomy, Impaired Limits, Other-Directedness, Overvigilance/Inhibition)
- **Schema modes**: Moment-to-moment emotional states and coping responses (e.g., Vulnerable Child mode, Angry Child mode, Punitive Parent mode, Healthy Adult mode)
- **Limited reparenting**: The therapist provides a corrective emotional experience within professional boundaries

**Indications**:
- BPD (RCT evidence comparable to DBT and MBT)
- Cluster C personality disorders (particularly avoidant and dependent)
- Narcissistic PD (emerging evidence)
- Chronic/treatment-resistant depression with personality pathology
- Any PD where specific maladaptive schemas can be identified

**Contraindications/limitations**:
- Active psychosis
- Severe dissociation (need stabilization first)
- Long duration (typically 2-3 years)

#### 2.4 Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP)

**What it is**: A structured psychodynamic psychotherapy that focuses on the **therapeutic relationship** (transference) as the primary arena for change.

**Developed by**: Otto Kernberg, for **Borderline Personality Disorder**.

**Theoretical basis**: Object relations theory — BPD results from failure to integrate "good" and "bad" representations of self and others (splitting). TFP uses the patient-therapist relationship to identify, confront, and integrate these split representations.

**Structure**:
- Twice-weekly individual sessions
- Clear treatment contract at outset
- Duration: typically 1-3 years

**Indications**:
- BPD (RCT evidence)
- Other Cluster B PDs with significant interpersonal pathology

**Contraindications/limitations**:
- Antisocial PD with severe psychopathy (poor treatment response)
- Active substance use
- Severe cognitive impairment
- Requires specialized training

#### 2.5 Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Related Approaches

**Standard CBT** can be adapted for personality disorders, though it is less specifically designed for PDs compared to DBT, MBT, or Schema Therapy:

**Indications by cluster** [2]:
- **Cluster A**: Limited evidence, but CBT can address paranoid cognitions and social skills deficits
- ***Antisocial PD: CBT if mild, has insight and motivation to improve*** [2]
- **Cluster C**: Good evidence for avoidant PD, OCPD; addresses cognitive distortions and avoidance behaviours

**Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT)**:
- Integrates cognitive and psychodynamic approaches
- Maps "reciprocal roles" (patterns of relating derived from early relationships)
- Brief (16-24 sessions)
- Evidence for BPD [18]

#### 2.6 Other Psychotherapeutic Approaches

| Modality | Description | Indications |
|---|---|---|
| **Psychodynamic psychotherapy** | Explores unconscious conflicts, defence mechanisms, early relationships; less structured than TFP | ***Psychotherapy: psychodynamic, cognitive therapy when well-motivated + stable*** [2]; Cluster A, B, and C PDs |
| **Supportive psychotherapy** | Provides emotional support, reality testing, guidance; less interpretive | All PDs, especially those not suitable for intensive therapies; ***usually difficult with slow progress*** in Cluster A [2] |
| **Social skills training** | Structured behavioural training in social interaction | ***Social skills training and group Tx*** for avoidant PD [2]; schizotypal PD |
| **Exposure therapy** | Graded exposure to feared social situations | ***Exposure therapy to gradually increase social contact*** for avoidant PD [2] |
| **Group therapy** | Various theoretical frameworks; provides safe social environment for interpersonal learning | Avoidant PD, dependent PD, BPD (as part of DBT skills groups) |
| ***Functional analytic psychotherapy*** | Focuses on the therapeutic relationship as a microcosm of the patient's interpersonal problems | ***Narcissistic PD*** — to identify maladaptive interpersonal patterns in real-time [2] |
| **Therapeutic communities** | Residential or day programmes; structured milieu therapy with group process | BPD, antisocial PD; ***day units to build therapeutic communities*** [2] |

---

### 3. Pharmacological Management

Let me be very clear about the role of medications in personality disorders:

<Callout title="The Cardinal Rule of Pharmacotherapy in PD" type="error">
***Drugs: as adjunct only to treat comorbid psychiatric disorders*** [2]. There is **no medication approved by the FDA, EMA, or MHRA specifically for any personality disorder**. Medications target **symptom domains** (mood instability, impulsivity, transient psychosis, anxiety) and **comorbid Axis I conditions** (depression, anxiety, substance use). Polypharmacy is a major risk in PD patients — resist the temptation to add more drugs for every symptom.
</Callout>

#### 3.1 Symptom-Domain-Based Pharmacotherapy (Primarily for BPD)

Since BPD has the most evidence, most pharmacological guidance pertains to BPD. The approach is **symptom-domain targeting**:

| Symptom Domain | Medication Options | Mechanism / Rationale | Evidence Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Affective dysregulation** (mood lability, depression, anxiety) | SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline), SNRIs | ↑Serotonin → ↑emotional regulation; addresses comorbid depression/anxiety | Moderate (SSRIs); limited for core BPD mood instability |
| **Affective dysregulation** | Mood stabilizers: lamotrigine, valproate, topiramate | Membrane stabilization, ↑GABA, glutamate modulation → ↓mood swings | Some RCT evidence for lamotrigine in BPD |
| **Impulsive-behavioural dyscontrol** (impulsivity, aggression, self-harm) | SSRIs (fluoxetine) | ↑Serotonin → ↓impulsivity and aggression (serotonin modulates impulse control) | Moderate |
| **Impulsive-behavioural dyscontrol** | Mood stabilizers (valproate, lithium) | ↓Impulsivity through neuronal membrane stabilization | Moderate for valproate; lithium has narrow therapeutic index — caution in overdose-prone patients |
| **Cognitive-perceptual symptoms** (transient psychosis, dissociation, paranoia) | Low-dose second-generation antipsychotics (aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine) | Dopamine receptor modulation → ↓psychotic-like experiences | Some evidence; use lowest effective dose for shortest duration |
| **Severe anxiety** | SSRIs, SNRIs | First-line for anxiety symptoms | Good evidence for comorbid anxiety |

#### 3.2 Cluster-Specific Pharmacotherapy

| Cluster / Disorder | Pharmacological Considerations | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Cluster A** | |
| Paranoid PD | Generally poorly studied; low-dose SGA if paranoid ideation is very distressing and impairing; SSRIs for comorbid anxiety/depression | Very limited |
| Schizoid PD | Rarely seek treatment; no specific pharmacotherapy; medications for comorbid conditions | Minimal |
| Schizotypal PD | ***Consider low-dose SGA for cognitive-perceptual symptoms with significant impairment or distress; consider stimulant for cognitive deficits; consider regular clonazepam, SSRI, SNRI for prominent social anxiety*** [2] | Limited RCTs; clinical consensus |
| **Cluster B** | |
| Antisocial PD | ***Trial of SGA, SSRI, mood stabilizers for those with severe aggression and willing to take medications*** [2]; ***seldom effective*** [2] | Very limited; must be mindful of manipulation |
| Borderline PD | Symptom-domain approach as above; avoid polypharmacy; avoid benzodiazepines | Moderate overall; NICE guidelines recommend against routine pharmacotherapy for BPD |
| Histrionic PD | No specific pharmacotherapy; treat comorbid mood/anxiety disorders | Minimal |
| Narcissistic PD | No specific pharmacotherapy; ***treatment often prompted by depression from dissolved romantic relationships*** [2]; treat comorbid depression | Minimal |
| **Cluster C** | |
| Avoidant PD | SSRIs/SNRIs for comorbid social anxiety; consider alongside psychotherapy | Moderate (for social anxiety component) |
| Dependent PD | ***Consider psychotropics for comorbid depression/anxiety, but caution for liability to dependence*** [2] | Limited; benzodiazepines contraindicated due to dependence risk |
| OCPD | SSRIs may help with rigidity and anxiety; treat comorbid conditions | Limited |

#### 3.3 Medications to AVOID in Personality Disorders

| Medication | Why Avoid | Relevant PD |
|---|---|---|
| **Benzodiazepines** | Paradoxical disinhibition (can worsen impulsivity and aggression); dependence risk; overdose risk when combined with other substances | BPD (paradoxical worsening); Dependent PD (dependence liability) [2]; all PDs with substance use comorbidity |
| **Tricyclic antidepressants** | Lethal in overdose (cardiac toxicity); given high suicide risk in BPD, this is unacceptable | BPD, any PD with suicidal ideation |
| **Lithium** | Narrow therapeutic index; lethal in overdose; requires monitoring and compliance — problematic in impulsive patients | BPD with poor compliance; ASPD |
| **Polypharmacy** | Patients with PD (especially BPD) may accumulate medications targeting each symptom without evidence; leads to side effects, interactions, and therapeutic nihilism | All PDs — always review and simplify |

<Callout title="NICE Guidelines on BPD Pharmacotherapy" type="idea">
The UK NICE guidelines (CG78, updated) explicitly state: **"Drug treatment should not be used specifically for borderline personality disorder or for the individual symptoms or behaviour associated with the disorder."** Medications should only be used for comorbid conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety) and should be **time-limited with regular review**. This reflects the concern about polypharmacy and the fact that psychotherapy, not medication, is the evidence-based treatment for BPD itself.
</Callout>

### 4. Crisis Management

Patients with personality disorders, particularly BPD and ASPD, frequently present in acute crisis. This requires a specific approach:

| Phase | Actions | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Immediate safety** | Assess for suicidality, self-harm, homicidality; secure safety of patient and staff; remove means | Life-threatening behaviours are the top priority in DBT's target hierarchy |
| **De-escalation** | Calm, non-judgmental, validating communication; avoid power struggles; set clear boundaries | Invalidation escalates crises in BPD; validation de-escalates |
| **Brief hospitalization** | Consider if imminent risk of serious self-harm or suicide; keep admission **short** (hours to days, not weeks) | ***Avoid prolonged admission for PD alone*** — prolonged hospitalization can reinforce sick role, increase dependency, and expose patients to iatrogenic harm (institutional regression) |
| **Discharge planning** | Ensure outpatient follow-up arranged; crisis plan in place; safety contacts identified | Crisis is an opportunity to engage the patient in longer-term treatment |
| **Team communication** | Ensure consistency of approach across all team members; prevent splitting | BPD patients may unconsciously split clinical teams (idealizing some staff, devaluing others) → inconsistent responses worsen the patient's distress |

---

### 5. Management by Specific Disorder: Detailed Approach

#### 5.1 Cluster A Management

| Disorder | Psychotherapy | Pharmacotherapy | Prognosis | Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Paranoid PD** | ***Psychotherapy as mainstay but depends on good therapist-client alliance; usually difficult with slow progress*** [2] | Low-dose SGA if paranoid ideation very distressing; SSRIs for comorbid mood/anxiety | ***Prone to develop delusional disorder or even psychosis*** [2] | ***Usually do not seek help on their own and often discontinue therapy*** [2] |
| **Schizoid PD** | ***Psychotherapy as mainstay including psychodynamic, CBT, supportive; usually difficult with slow progress*** [2] | No specific pharmacotherapy | Stable, chronic course | ***Rarely seek help and often drop out; tend to intellectualize problems and question value of treatment*** [2] |
| **Schizotypal PD** | ***Psychodynamically-informed, supportive-expressive approach*** [2] | ***Low-dose SGA for cognitive-perceptual symptoms; stimulant for cognitive deficits; clonazepam, SSRI, SNRI for prominent social anxiety*** [2] | 10-20% develop schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder | Social anxiety may be treatment-limiting |

#### 5.2 Cluster B Management

| Disorder | Psychotherapy | Pharmacotherapy | Prognosis | Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Borderline PD** | ***DBT*** (gold standard) [2][18]; ***MBT*** [2]; Schema Therapy; TFP; CAT | Symptom-domain approach; avoid BZDs; time-limited with regular review | Many remit over 10 years (~85-90%); functional impairment may persist | Chronic suicidality; splitting of clinical teams; treatment dropout |
| **Antisocial PD** | ***CBT if mild, has insight and motivation to improve; majority delivered by forensic psychiatrists*** [2]; ***must be mindful of manipulation of therapeutic relationship*** [2] | ***Trial of SGA, SSRI, mood stabilizers for those with severe aggression and willing to take medications*** [2] | Behavioural features tend to "burn out" after age 40; interpersonal deficits persist | ***Seldom effective*** [2]; high manipulation; low motivation; often forensic context |
| **Histrionic PD** | ***Cognitive therapy*** [2]; psychodynamic therapy; group therapy | Treat comorbid conditions only | Variable; ***treatment often prompted by depression from dissolved romantic relationships*** [2] | Seductiveness and drama in the therapeutic relationship |
| **Narcissistic PD** | ***Cognitive therapy; functional analytic psychotherapy*** [2]; psychodynamic therapy; Schema therapy | Treat comorbid depression and substance use | Variable; vulnerable to decompensation during life transitions | Grandiosity may prevent engagement; vulnerable subtype may be more treatable |

#### 5.3 Cluster C Management

| Disorder | Psychotherapy | Pharmacotherapy | Prognosis | Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Avoidant PD** | ***Social skills training and group therapy; exposure therapy to gradually increase social contact*** [2]; CBT | SSRIs/SNRIs for comorbid social anxiety/depression | ***Significant improvement possible*** [2] | ***Often difficult to gain/keep patient's trust as fear therapist rejection*** [2] |
| **Dependent PD** | ***Psychotherapy with aim of making the individual more independent and help form healthier relationships*** [2] | ***Consider psychotropics for comorbid depression/anxiety, but caution for liability to dependence*** [2] | Variable; dependent on establishing therapeutic independence | Patient may become dependent on therapist; must manage this proactively |
| **OCPD** | CBT (addressing perfectionism, control); psychodynamic therapy | SSRIs for rigidity, anxiety, comorbid conditions | Chronic; may improve with sustained psychotherapy | Rigidity may impede therapeutic engagement; patient may resist unstructured approaches |

---

### 6. Social and Occupational Interventions

| Intervention | Description | Indication |
|---|---|---|
| **Occupational therapy** | Assessment and support for work skills, daily living skills, structured activity | All PDs with functional impairment |
| **Vocational rehabilitation** | Supported employment, job coaching, workplace accommodation | Especially for severe BPD, ASPD, schizotypal PD with occupational dysfunction |
| **Housing support** | Supported housing, crisis accommodation | Severe PD with homelessness or unstable housing |
| **Social work** | Financial support, legal advocacy, child protection liaison | ASPD (forensic liaison); BPD (child protection concerns); dependent PD |
| **Family/carer support** | Psychoeducation for family, carer support groups | All PDs — family members often suffer significantly |
| **Peer support** | Recovery-focused peer support workers | Emerging evidence, especially for BPD |

---

### 7. Special Considerations

#### 7.1 The Therapeutic Relationship in PD Management

This deserves special emphasis because it is unique to PD:

- ***Cluster B → difficult relationship with clinicians → often excluded from care*** [2]. This is a clinical reality and an ethical challenge. Patients with BPD and ASPD generate strong countertransference reactions (frustration, anger, helplessness, rescue fantasies). These reactions are **informative** (they reflect the patient's interpersonal patterns) but must be managed through team supervision, not acted upon.
- ***Obsessional trait → frustrated and resistant if response does not follow expectation*** [2]. Patients with OCPD may become controlling in therapy, insisting on specific structures or procedures.
- **Splitting**: BPD patients may idealize one team member and devalue another, creating conflict within the clinical team. The antidote is **consistent communication** and a **shared treatment plan**.

#### 7.2 Hong Kong Context

- **Public psychiatric services**: Hospital Authority psychiatric services provide outpatient and inpatient care; some specialized personality disorder services exist (e.g., DBT programmes in selected clusters)
- **Private sector**: Private psychologists and psychiatrists offering DBT, Schema Therapy, and psychodynamic psychotherapy
- **Cultural considerations**: The concept of "personality disorder" may carry more stigma in Chinese culture; family involvement may be more important in treatment; somatization of psychological distress may be more common
- **Resource limitations**: Full DBT programmes (individual therapy + skills group + phone coaching + consultation team) are resource-intensive and may not be available in all public settings

#### 7.3 Treatment of Comorbid Conditions

Always treat comorbid Axis I disorders aggressively — they are often the source of acute distress and the reason the patient presents:

| Comorbidity | Treatment Approach |
|---|---|
| **Major depression** | SSRI/SNRI (avoid TCAs — overdose risk); psychotherapy (CBT, IPT); combine with PD-specific therapy |
| **Anxiety disorders** | SSRI/SNRI first-line; CBT; avoid benzodiazepines |
| **PTSD** | Trauma-focused CBT or EMDR; stabilization before trauma processing if severe PD |
| **Substance use** | Integrated dual-diagnosis approach; motivational interviewing; substance-specific interventions |
| **Eating disorders** | CBT-E; family-based treatment in younger patients; address PD pathology concurrently |

---

### 8. Summary: Treatment Evidence by Personality Disorder

| PD | Evidence-Based Psychotherapy | Pharmacotherapy Role | Overall Evidence Strength |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Paranoid** | Supportive, psychodynamic | Minimal; SGA/SSRI for comorbidities | Weak |
| **Schizoid** | Supportive, CBT, psychodynamic | Minimal | Weak |
| **Schizotypal** | Supportive-expressive | Low-dose SGA, SSRI, stimulants | Moderate |
| **Antisocial** | CBT (if motivated), forensic programmes | SGA, SSRI, mood stabilizers for aggression | Weak |
| **Borderline** | **DBT, MBT, Schema Therapy, TFP, CAT** | Symptom-domain adjunct only | **Strong** |
| **Histrionic** | Cognitive therapy, psychodynamic | For comorbidities only | Weak |
| **Narcissistic** | Cognitive therapy, Schema Therapy, psychodynamic | For comorbidities only | Weak |
| **Avoidant** | CBT, exposure therapy, social skills training | SSRI/SNRI for social anxiety | Moderate |
| **Dependent** | Psychotherapy (autonomy-building) | For comorbidities; avoid BZDs | Weak-Moderate |
| **OCPD** | CBT, psychodynamic | SSRI for rigidity/comorbidities | Moderate |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Core principle**: ***Psychological support is the mainstay; drugs are adjuncts only for comorbid conditions*** [2].

**For Borderline PD** (most evidence):
- 1st line: **DBT** (emotional regulation + mindfulness + distress tolerance + interpersonal effectiveness) or **MBT** (restoring mentalizing capacity)
- 2nd line: Schema Therapy, TFP, CAT
- Pharmacotherapy: symptom-domain targeting (SSRIs for affective dysregulation/impulsivity, low-dose SGA for transient psychosis, mood stabilizers for mood instability). **Avoid benzodiazepines, avoid TCAs, avoid polypharmacy.**
- Crisis: brief hospitalization only if imminent risk; avoid prolonged admission.

**For Antisocial PD**: ***Seldom effective; CBT if mild with insight; forensic MDT if severe*** [2].

**For Cluster A**: Supportive/psychodynamic psychotherapy; low-dose SGA for schizotypal cognitive-perceptual symptoms [2].

**For Cluster C**: CBT, exposure therapy, social skills training; SSRIs for comorbid anxiety/depression.

**NICE guideline key point**: Do not use medications specifically for BPD itself — only for comorbid conditions, time-limited with review.

**Therapeutic relationship**: The treatment tool AND the challenge. Manage countertransference, prevent splitting, maintain consistent boundaries.
