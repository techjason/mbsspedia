# Personality and Personality Disorders

## 1. Definition and Key Concepts

### What is Personality?

***Personality traits*** are **enduring patterns** of perceiving, thinking about, and relating to both the self and the environment, exhibited across a wide range of social and personal contexts [1][2]. Think of personality as the "operating system" of a person — it colours every interaction, every reaction, every decision they make.

The critical distinction between personality and a mental disorder is this:
- **Personality behaviours** are present **throughout adult life** — they are the baseline, the "factory settings."
- **Psychiatric behaviours** represent a **change from the premorbid state** — they are a departure from baseline.

This distinction matters enormously in clinical practice. When you're assessing someone, you must always ask: *"Is this who they've always been, or is this new?"*

### What is a Personality Disorder (PD)?

A **personality disorder** refers to persistently **inflexible and maladaptive** personality traits that are:
- **Stable over time** (usually evident by late adolescence/early adulthood)
- Cause **significant personal distress** and/or **functional impairment** (in work, relationships, social life)
- Represent an **enduring pattern** that deviates markedly from cultural expectations
- Are **pervasive** across multiple domains (cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning, impulse control)

In other words, a personality disorder is the extreme, rigid, and harmful end of the personality spectrum. Everyone has personality traits; a disorder is present when those traits become a prison.

<Callout title="ICD-11 Major Shift" type="idea">
The ICD-11 (adopted by WHO in 2022 and now the current standard) has **completely overhauled** personality disorder classification. It abandons the old categorical subtypes (paranoid, schizoid, histrionic, etc.) in favour of a **dimensional model** with severity grading (mild, moderate, severe) and **trait domain qualifiers** (Negative Affectivity, Detachment, Dissociality, Disinhibition, Anankastia). A separate "Borderline pattern" qualifier is retained. DSM-5 Section II retains the old categorical system, while DSM-5 Section III (Alternative Model — AMPD) also proposes a hybrid dimensional-categorical approach. For HKU exams, know **both** the traditional clusters (DSM-5 Section II / ICD-10) **and** the ICD-11 dimensional approach.

### Why Personality Matters in Psychiatry

This is a favourite teaching point and exam topic [2]:

1. ***Predisposition***: Personality modifies an **individual's response** to stressful events → predisposes to certain disorders. For example, someone high in neuroticism processes negative events more intensely and is more vulnerable to depression [3][4].

2. ***Pathoplastic factor*** (literally "moulds the illness"): Personality **colours the presentation** of psychiatric conditions [2]. For example:
   - ***Rumination and inhibition*** in depression with **obsessional personality** — the patient can't "let go" of guilty thoughts
   - A patient with dependent traits who develops depression may present primarily with clinging, help-seeking behaviour

3. ***Premorbid personality*** assessment is crucial for making psychiatric diagnoses [2] — you need to know the baseline to know what's changed.

4. ***Treatment-related***: Personality is an important determinant of **attitude towards treatment** and **relationship with the therapist** [2]:
   - Obsessional traits → frustrated and resistant if treatment doesn't follow expectations
   - ***Cluster B*** traits → **difficult relationship with clinicians** → often excluded from care (a major clinical problem)
   - Dependent traits → may become overly reliant on the therapist

5. ***Substance use***: Personality traits influence vulnerability to substance use [5]:
   - ***Sensation-seeking, impulsive personality traits, more extrovert*** → ***predispose to experiment with both licit and illicit drugs***
   - ***Obsessional, dependent or anxious*** → ***more likely to get dependent and difficult to stop***

<Callout title="High Yield Exam Point">
Always think of personality as a "background vulnerability" that interacts with stressors and biological factors. This is the **biopsychosocial model** in action. Personality sits squarely in the "psychological" domain but overlaps heavily with biology (genetics, temperament) and social factors (attachment, upbringing).
</Callout>

## 2. Epidemiology

- **Overall prevalence**: Estimated ~**10-13%** in the general population (commonly cited as ~11%) [2]
- **More common in**: Males, younger age groups, those who are poorly educated, unemployed, and low socioeconomic status [2]
- **Setting-dependent prevalence**:
  - Primary care: ~20-30%
  - Psychiatric outpatients: ~40-60%
  - Psychiatric inpatients: ~50-70%
  - Prison populations: up to 60-70% (particularly antisocial PD)
- **Cluster-specific** (approximate community prevalences):
  - **Cluster A** (Odd/Eccentric): ~5-7%
    - Paranoid PD: ~4.4%
    - Schizoid PD: ~3-5%
    - Schizotypal PD: ~3-4%
  - **Cluster B** (Dramatic/Emotional): ~1.5-5%
    - Antisocial PD: ~3-5% M, ~1% F
    - Borderline PD: ~1.6-5.9% (often cited ~2%), F > M in clinical samples (but may be equal in community)
    - Histrionic PD: ~1.84%, 65% F [2]
    - Narcissistic PD: lifetime ~6.2%, M > F [2]
  - **Cluster C** (Anxious/Fearful): ~6-10%
    - Avoidant PD: ~2.36%, M = F [2]
    - Dependent PD: ~0.49%, F > M [2]
    - Obsessive-compulsive PD: ~2.1-7.9%, M > F (2:1) [2]

**Comorbidity is the rule, not the exception**: Most people with one PD meet criteria for at least one other PD, and comorbid Axis I disorders (depression, anxiety, substance use) are extremely common. This is one of the biggest criticisms of the categorical system — the overlap is enormous.

**Hong Kong context**: There is limited large-scale epidemiological data specific to Hong Kong. However, personality disorders are recognized in Hong Kong psychiatric practice, with borderline and antisocial PDs being commonly encountered in clinical and forensic settings respectively. Cultural factors may influence presentation — for example, "saving face" in Chinese culture may lead to underreporting of interpersonal dysfunction, and somatization may be more prominent as a presentation of underlying personality pathology.

## 3. Origins of Personality (Aetiology of Normal Personality)

Understanding normal personality development is the foundation for understanding personality disorders.

### 3.1 Genetics

- **Heritability**: Twin studies show **35-50% heritability** for personality traits [2]
- This is a **cumulative effect of multiple genes**, each accounting for a small effect [2]
- Some genes overlap with those implicated in psychiatric disorders (e.g., genes related to neuroticism overlap with genes for depression) [2][3]
- Specific genes identified include those related to:
  - **Serotonin transporter** (5-HTTLPR) — linked to neuroticism and harm avoidance
  - **Dopamine receptors** (DRD4) — linked to novelty seeking
  - **BDNF** — linked to emotional regulation
  - **COMT** — involved in dopamine metabolism in the prefrontal cortex

### 3.2 Temperament

- **Temperament** refers to preliminary differences in **behavioural patterns** among young infants (e.g., sleep/waking patterns, intensity of emotional reactions, activity level) [2]
- These form the **biological basis** of personality development
- Temperaments persist into later childhood, but their precise relationship with adult personality is difficult to establish [2]
- Classic temperamental dimensions (Thomas & Chess):
  - Activity level
  - Rhythmicity
  - Approach/withdrawal
  - Adaptability
  - Threshold of responsiveness
  - Intensity of reaction
  - Quality of mood
  - Distractibility
  - Attention span/persistence
- Kagan's work on **behavioural inhibition** (tendency to be timid and shy in novel situations) is particularly relevant — this temperamental trait is a precursor to avoidant personality and social anxiety [6]

### 3.3 Childhood Experiences and Developmental Theories

#### Freud's Psychosexual Development
- Proposed **5 stages** of libido development (oral, anal, phallic, latency, genital)
- Personality develops through resolution of conflicts between the **id** (primitive drives) and **social norms** (superego) [2]
- Failure to resolve these conflicts ("fixation") is said to explain certain personality traits:
  - Oral fixation → dependent, passive traits
  - Anal fixation → obsessional, rigid, controlling traits
  - Phallic fixation → narcissistic, overly competitive traits

#### Jung's Analytical Psychology
- Proposed a **lifelong process** of personality development with **individualization** (integration of conscious and unconscious) as the ultimate aim [2]

#### Erikson's Psychosocial Stages
- Proposed **8 developmental stages**, each with a specific conflict to be resolved [2]:

| Age | Stage | Conflict | Virtue (Resolution) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0-1 years | Infancy | Basic trust vs. mistrust | Hope |
| 1-3 years | Early childhood | Autonomy vs. shame/doubt | Will |
| 3-6 years | Play age | Initiative vs. guilt | Purpose |
| 6-12 years | School age | Industry vs. inferiority | Competence |
| 12-19 years | Adolescence | Identity vs. confusion | Fidelity |
| 20-25 years | Early adulthood | Intimacy vs. isolation | Love |
| 26-64 years | Adulthood | Generativity vs. stagnation | Care |
| 65+ years | Old age | Integrity vs. despair | Wisdom |

<Callout title="Why Erikson Matters Clinically">
Failure at any stage creates lasting vulnerability. For example, failure to develop basic trust (stage 1) → difficulty trusting others → paranoid or avoidant traits. Failure at identity stage (stage 5) → identity diffusion → borderline personality features. Understanding which developmental stage "failed" helps guide psychotherapy.
</Callout>

#### Attachment Theory (Bowlby, Ainsworth)
- ***Early insecure or anxious attachment*** with the primary caregiver results in ***later difficulty in forming relationships*** [2]
- Attachment styles:
  - **Secure attachment** → healthy interpersonal functioning
  - **Anxious-ambivalent attachment** → clingy, dependent, fearful of abandonment → dependent PD, borderline PD
  - **Anxious-avoidant attachment** → emotionally distant, dismissive → schizoid PD, avoidant PD
  - **Disorganized attachment** (a/w trauma, abuse) → chaotic relationships, dissociation → borderline PD, antisocial PD
- This is one of the most empirically supported models for personality disorder development

## 4. Aetiology of Personality Disorders (Specific)

The aetiology of personality disorders follows the **biopsychosocial model**, with each cluster having somewhat different emphases.

### 4.1 Biological Factors

#### Genetics
- PDs show **significant heritability**:
  - **Antisocial PD**: Heritability ~50-70% (one of the highest)
  - **Borderline PD**: Heritability ~40-65%
  - **Histrionic PD**: Heritability ~0.67 [2]
  - **Narcissistic PD**: Heritability > 0.6 [2]
  - **Dependent PD**: Heritability 0.55-0.72 [2]
  - **Obsessive-compulsive PD**: Associated with DRD3 gene [2]
  - **Schizotypal PD**: Shares genetic risk with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders [7]
- **Paranoid PD**: Has a genetic relationship with **delusional disorder** [2]
- **Schizotypal PD**: Shares genetic risk with **schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and paranoid PD** [7] — it is essentially on the "schizophrenia spectrum"

#### Neurobiology
- **Antisocial PD**:
  - Reduced prefrontal cortex volume (especially orbitofrontal) → impaired impulse control and moral reasoning
  - Reduced amygdala reactivity → diminished fear conditioning and empathy
  - Low autonomic arousal → reduced anticipatory anxiety → failure to learn from punishment
- **Borderline PD**:
  - Amygdala hyperreactivity → exaggerated emotional responses
  - Prefrontal cortex hypoactivity → poor emotional regulation
  - Reduced hippocampal volume (likely related to early trauma/chronic stress)
  - Altered serotonergic function → impulsivity and aggression
- **Histrionic PD**: Hypothesized to involve **highly responsive noradrenergic systems** [2]
- **Narcissistic PD**: Structural differences in **neural circuitry for empathy** [2]
- **Cluster A PDs**: Show some of the same neurobiological abnormalities as schizophrenia (e.g., dopaminergic dysregulation, cognitive processing deficits)

#### Neurotransmitters
- **Serotonin**: Low serotonergic function consistently associated with **impulsivity and aggression** (relevant to Cluster B, especially borderline and antisocial)
- **Dopamine**: Implicated in **reward-seeking and novelty-seeking** behaviour (relevant to antisocial and narcissistic PDs), and in the schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (Cluster A)
- **Noradrenaline**: May contribute to **emotional reactivity** (histrionic PD)
- **Oxytocin/vasopressin**: Emerging evidence for roles in **attachment and trust** (relevant to all PDs with interpersonal dysfunction)

### 4.2 Psychological Factors

#### Early Childhood Experience
This is arguably the most important aetiological domain, especially for Cluster B:

- **Borderline PD**: Strong association with:
  - Childhood **physical and sexual abuse** (reported in 40-70% of cases)
  - **Emotional neglect** and invalidating environments (Linehan's biosocial theory: the child's emotional experiences are persistently invalidated → they never learn to regulate emotions)
  - **Disorganized attachment** patterns
- **Antisocial PD**: Associated with:
  - Childhood conduct disorder (required for diagnosis)
  - Parental criminality, substance abuse
  - Harsh, inconsistent, or absent parenting
  - Early institutionalization
- **Avoidant PD**: Associated with childhood **emotional neglect** and **peer group rejection** [2]
- **Dependent PD**: Associated with **overprotective and authoritarian parenting** and **early traumatic experiences** [2]
- **Narcissistic PD**: Associated with **parental overprotectiveness and overvaluation** coupled with **frustration and rejection** [2]
- **OCPD**: Associated with **overprotective or over-involved parenting** and triggered by **trauma** [2]

#### Psychoanalytic Theories
- **Histrionic PD**: Freud proposed failure of mature intimacy + unresolved Oedipus complex → **oversexualization of relationships** [2]
- **Borderline PD**: Object relations theory (Kernberg) — failure to integrate "good" and "bad" representations of self and others → **splitting** as a defence mechanism
- **Antisocial PD**: Failure of superego development → absence of guilt and moral conscience

#### Personality Factors as Risk for Other Disorders
This is a cross-cutting theme across psychiatry:
- ***Neuroticism*** → depression, anxiety disorders [3][4]
- ***Behavioural inhibition*** → avoidant PD, social anxiety disorder, GAD [6]
- ***Sensation-seeking, impulsivity*** → substance use disorders, antisocial PD [5]
- ***Sociotropy*** (strong need for peer approval) → depression [3]

### 4.3 Social Factors

- **Socioeconomic deprivation**: Poverty, unemployment, poor housing — all associated with higher rates of PD (cause vs. consequence debate)
- **Cultural factors**: Culture shapes what is considered "abnormal" personality. Some traits may be more acceptable in certain cultures (e.g., dependence on family in collectivist cultures may not be pathological)
- **Urbanicity**: Higher rates of PD in urban environments
- **Social media and modern environment**: Emerging concern about narcissistic traits being reinforced by social media culture (though not yet established in formal literature)

## 5. Approaches to Describing and Defining Personality Disorders

This is a conceptually important section that examiners love [2]:

### 5.1 Describing Personality

| Approach | Description | Clinical Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Dimensional approach** | PDs differ from normal only in **degree**; maladaptive traits are the extreme end of a continuum | Predominantly in research (impractical clinically, though ICD-11 now uses this) |
| **Categorical approach** | Assumes existence of **discrete** PDs with distinct boundaries | Widely used in DSM-5 (Section II) and ICD-10; however, there is considerable overlap between categories |

### 5.2 Criteria for Defining Disorders

| Criterion | Description | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| **Statistical criterion** | Abnormal personality defined as quantitative variation from normal; dividing line set by a cut-off score | Clinically impractical; arbitrary cut-offs |
| **Social criterion** | Abnormality defined as propensity for the individual **or other people** to suffer | Subjective and lacks precision, but more appropriate for clinical settings |

<Callout title="The Problem with Categories" type="error">
One of the most common exam pitfalls is to treat personality disorder categories as completely separate entities. In reality, **clinicians often agree on the presence of a PD but disagree on the subtype** [2]. There is enormous overlap between categories. This is why ICD-11 has moved to a dimensional model. Remember: the map is not the territory.
</Callout>

### 5.3 ICD-11 Dimensional Model (Current Standard)

The ICD-11 classification (now the WHO standard, effective since 2022) represents a paradigm shift:

1. **First, determine severity**: Is there a personality disorder? If so, is it:
   - **Mild**: Disturbance primarily in one area (e.g., self or interpersonal), does not pervasively affect all domains
   - **Moderate**: Multiple areas of personality functioning affected, but not all relationships/situations
   - **Severe**: Severe disturbances affecting self and others, high risk of harm

2. **Then, specify trait domain qualifiers**:
   - **Negative Affectivity**: Tendency to experience a broad range of negative emotions (anxiety, anger, self-contempt, depression)
   - **Detachment**: Tendency to maintain interpersonal distance (social withdrawal, restricted emotional expression)
   - **Dissociality**: Disregard for others' rights and feelings, lack of empathy, callousness, exploitativeness
   - **Disinhibition**: Tendency toward impulsive behaviour, irresponsibility, risk-taking
   - **Anankastia**: Focus on rigid perfectionism, constraint, control of self and situations

3. **Borderline pattern qualifier**: Retained as a special "pattern specifier" because of the extensive evidence base for its treatment (e.g., DBT)

### 5.4 DSM-5 Classification (Still Widely Used)

DSM-5 retains the traditional **three-cluster categorical system** in Section II:

| Cluster | Name | Mnemonic | Common Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | **Odd/Eccentric** | "**Weird**" | Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal |
| **B** | **Dramatic/Emotional/Erratic** | "**Wild**" | Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, Narcissistic |
| **C** | **Anxious/Fearful** | "**Worried**" | Avoidant, Dependent, Obsessive-Compulsive |

> **Mnemonic for remembering the clusters:**
> - Cluster A: "**A**wkward" (odd)
> - Cluster B: "**B**ad" (dramatic) — or "**B**orderline is the poster child"
> - Cluster C: "**C**owardly" (anxious)

**DSM-5 General Diagnostic Criteria for a Personality Disorder:**
- A. An enduring pattern of inner experience and behaviour that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture, manifested in ≥2 of:
  1. Cognition (perception/interpretation of self, others, events)
  2. Affectivity (range, intensity, lability, appropriateness of emotional response)
  3. Interpersonal functioning
  4. Impulse control
- B. Pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations
- C. Leads to clinically significant distress or impairment
- D. Pattern is stable and of long duration, traceable to at least adolescence or early adulthood
- E. Not better explained by another mental disorder
- F. Not attributable to effects of a substance or medical condition

---

## 6. Classification: The Three Clusters in Detail

### 6.1 Cluster A — The Odd/Eccentric Cluster

These disorders share features with the **psychotic spectrum**. Patients are "odd" — they seem disconnected from social reality. Think of Cluster A as being on the schizophrenia spectrum but without full-blown psychosis.

#### 6.1.1 Paranoid Personality Disorder

| Domain | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prevalence** | ~4.4% [2] |
| **Gender** | Slightly M > F |
| **Genetic link** | Genetic relationship with **delusional disorder** [2]; shares genetic liability with schizophrenia spectrum |
| **Core pathology** | Pervasive, unjustified **mistrust and suspicion** of others' motives, interpreting them as malevolent |

**Clinical Features (with pathophysiology):**

- **Suspects, without sufficient basis, that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving them** → This stems from a cognitive schema of "the world is dangerous and others cannot be trusted," likely rooted in early experiences of betrayal or insecure attachment
- **Preoccupied with unjustified doubts about loyalty/trustworthiness of friends/associates** → Hypervigilance and threat detection bias (similar to the amygdala hyperreactivity seen in anxiety but here projected onto social relationships)
- **Reluctant to confide in others** because of fear that information will be used against them
- **Reads hidden demeaning or threatening meanings into benign remarks** → Cognitive bias toward hostile attribution
- **Persistently bears grudges** (unforgiving of insults, injuries, slights)
- **Perceives attacks on character not apparent to others** and is quick to react angrily or counterattack
- **Recurrent suspicions regarding fidelity of spouse/partner** without justification
- **Emotionally cold, distant, humourless**, with limited capacity for warm interpersonal engagement

**Why does this matter clinically?**
- These patients are extremely difficult to engage in treatment because they don't trust the therapist
- They may present with comorbid anxiety or depression but the underlying paranoid traits make treatment challenging
- Important to differentiate from delusional disorder (paranoid type) — in PD, beliefs are **overvalued ideas** (not fixed delusions), and reality testing is partially preserved

#### 6.1.2 Schizoid Personality Disorder

| Domain | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prevalence** | ~3-5% |
| **Gender** | Slightly M > F |
| **Core pathology** | Pervasive pattern of **detachment from social relationships** and **restricted range of emotional expression** |

**Clinical Features (with pathophysiology):**

- **Neither desires nor enjoys close relationships**, including being part of a family → Not due to anxiety (cf. avoidant PD) but a fundamental **lack of interest** in social bonds — think of it as an absence of the social drive
- **Almost always chooses solitary activities** → Preference, not avoidance
- **Little, if any, interest in sexual experiences** with another person
- **Takes pleasure in few, if any, activities** → Restricted hedonic capacity (anhedonia-like but stable, not episodic)
- **Lacks close friends or confidants** other than first-degree relatives
- **Appears indifferent to praise or criticism** → Emotional flatness is genuine, not defensive
- Shows **emotional coldness, detachment, or flattened affectivity**
- Rich **inner fantasy life** may be present (distinguishing feature)

<Callout title="Schizoid vs. Avoidant — A Common Exam Trap" type="error">
Both schizoid and avoidant personality disorders involve social isolation, but the **mechanism is completely different**:
- **Schizoid**: Genuinely **does not want** social contact. There is no distress about the isolation.
- **Avoidant**: **Desperately wants** social contact but **fears** rejection and criticism. There is significant distress.
This distinction is a favourite exam question.
</Callout>

#### 6.1.3 Schizotypal Personality Disorder

| Domain | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prevalence** | ~3-4% |
| **Classification note** | In **ICD-10**, schizotypal disorder is classified under **psychotic disorders** (F21), NOT personality disorders [2]. In **DSM-5**, it remains a personality disorder. In **ICD-11**, it is classified as "Schizotypal disorder" under schizophrenia spectrum. |
| **Genetic link** | Shares genetic risk with **schizophrenia**, schizoaffective disorder, and paranoid PD [7] |

**Clinical Features (with pathophysiology):**

- **Ideas of reference** (not delusions of reference) → Cognitive processing bias, subthreshold psychotic-like experience
- **Odd beliefs or magical thinking** inconsistent with cultural norms (e.g., telepathy, clairvoyance, "sixth sense")
- **Unusual perceptual experiences** including bodily illusions
- **Odd thinking and speech** (vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelaborate)
- **Suspiciousness or paranoid ideation** → Overlaps with paranoid PD
- **Inappropriate or constricted affect**
- **Odd, eccentric, or peculiar behaviour or appearance**
- **Lacks close friends** other than first-degree relatives
- **Excessive social anxiety** that does not diminish with familiarity (and is associated with paranoid fears rather than negative self-judgments)

**Pathophysiology**: Schizotypal PD is best understood as a **milder, attenuated form of schizophrenia** — same genetic vulnerability, similar (but less severe) neurobiological abnormalities (dopamine dysregulation, structural brain changes), but without the frank psychosis. About 10-25% of individuals with schizotypal PD will eventually develop schizophrenia.

---

### 6.2 Cluster B — The Dramatic/Emotional/Erratic Cluster

This is the cluster that causes the most clinical drama, the most countertransference, and the most exam questions. These disorders are characterized by **emotional dysregulation**, **interpersonal dysfunction**, and **impulsivity**.

#### 6.2.1 Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD)

| Domain | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prevalence** | ~3% M, ~1% F |
| **Gender** | Strongly M > F |
| **ICD-10 name** | **Dissocial PD** [2] |
| **Key prerequisite** | DSM-5 requires evidence of **conduct disorder** before age 15 |
| **Genetic link** | Strong genetic component (heritability ~50-70%); linked to impulsivity, aggression genes |

**Clinical Features (with pathophysiology):**

- **Pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others** since age 15
- **Failure to conform to social norms** → Deficient superego development (psychoanalytic view); impaired prefrontal cortical function (neurobiological view) → poor moral reasoning and consequence evaluation
- **Deceitfulness**: Repeated lying, use of aliases, conning others for personal profit/pleasure → Interpersonal manipulation reflecting callous-unemotional traits
- **Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead** → Prefrontal hypofunction → poor executive function and delay discounting (preference for immediate reward over delayed larger reward)
- **Irritability and aggressiveness**: Repeated physical fights or assaults → Low serotonergic tone → reduced threshold for aggressive response; amygdala hypoactivation → reduced fear response
- **Reckless disregard for safety of self or others** → Low autonomic arousal → sensation-seeking to achieve "normal" arousal levels
- **Consistent irresponsibility**: Failure to sustain consistent work behaviour or honour financial obligations
- **Lack of remorse**: Indifference to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another → Deficient empathic processing; structural differences in anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex

**The "psychopath" concept**: Note that ASPD and psychopathy are **not the same thing**. ASPD is a diagnosis focused on *behavioural criteria* (criminal/irresponsible behaviour). Psychopathy (assessed by Hare's Psychopathy Checklist-Revised, PCL-R) emphasizes *interpersonal and affective deficits* (superficial charm, grandiosity, callousness, lack of remorse). Most psychopaths meet ASPD criteria, but most people with ASPD are *not* psychopaths.

#### 6.2.2 Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)

| Domain | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prevalence** | ~1.6-5.9% (community); up to 20% of psychiatric inpatients |
| **Gender** | F > M in clinical samples (may be equal in community) |
| **ICD-10 name** | ***Emotionally unstable personality disorder*** (divided into "borderline" and "impulsive" types) [2] |
| **ICD-11** | Retained as a **"Borderline pattern" qualifier** due to strong treatment evidence base |
| **Key associations** | Childhood abuse (40-70%), depression (83% lifetime), substance use (64%), suicide (8-10% lifetime completion rate) |

This is arguably the **most clinically important** personality disorder and the one with the most evidence for effective treatment.

**Clinical Features (with pathophysiology):**

- **Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment** → Rooted in insecure (disorganized) attachment; amygdala hyperreactivity to perceived social rejection → intense fear response even to ambiguous social cues
- ***Unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation*** ("splitting") → Object relations failure — inability to hold simultaneously positive and negative views of the same person → black-and-white thinking. When the person meets their needs, they are "perfect"; when they don't, they are "terrible"
- **Identity disturbance**: Markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self → Corresponds to Erikson's stage 5 failure (identity vs. role confusion); neurobiologically, anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal dysfunction impairs self-referential processing
- **Impulsivity** in ≥2 areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating) → Prefrontal cortex hypofunction → poor impulse control; dopaminergic reward system dysregulation → seeking stimulation
- **Recurrent suicidal behaviour, gestures, threats, or self-mutilating behaviour** → Self-harm often serves an emotional regulation function ("I feel so much emotional pain that physical pain provides relief" or "I feel so numb that pain makes me feel alive"); also serves an interpersonal function (communicating distress)
- **Affective instability** due to marked reactivity of mood → Amygdala hyperreactivity + prefrontal hypoactivity → inability to modulate emotional responses → rapid mood shifts lasting hours (not days as in bipolar)
- **Chronic feelings of emptiness** → Related to identity disturbance and lack of stable internal object representations
- **Inappropriate, intense anger** or difficulty controlling anger → Serotonergic dysfunction + amygdala hyperreactivity
- **Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms** → Under extreme stress, the cognitive processing becomes so overwhelmed that brief psychotic-like symptoms emerge (this is NOT schizophrenia — symptoms are transient and stress-related)

<Callout title="BPD vs. Bipolar Disorder" type="error">
This is one of the most commonly tested differential diagnoses:
- **BPD mood shifts**: Last **hours**, are triggered by **interpersonal events**, return to a baseline of **emptiness/dysphoria**
- **Bipolar mood shifts**: Last **days to weeks**, may be **spontaneous** or triggered, involve **elevated mood/grandiosity** (mania), and there is often a euthymic baseline between episodes
- Many patients carry both diagnoses — they are not mutually exclusive
</Callout>

**Linehan's Biosocial Model** (the most influential model for BPD):
1. **Biological vulnerability**: Innate emotional vulnerability (high sensitivity, high reactivity, slow return to baseline) — likely genetically determined temperament
2. **Invalidating environment**: Childhood environment that persistently dismisses, punishes, or ignores the child's emotional experiences ("stop crying," "you're overreacting," "that's nothing to be upset about")
3. **Result**: The child never learns to label, understand, or regulate their emotions → emotional dysregulation becomes the core pathology → all other BPD features flow from this

#### 6.2.3 Histrionic Personality Disorder

| Domain | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prevalence** | ~1.84%, 65% F [2] |
| **Heritability** | ~0.67 [2] |
| **Neurobiology** | Possibly highly responsive noradrenergic systems [2] |
| **Psychoanalytic** | Freud: failure of mature intimacy + Oedipus complex → **oversexualization of relationships** [2] |

**Clinical Features (with pathophysiology):**

- ***Self-dramatization with emotional blackmail, angry scenes, demonstrative suicide attempts*** [2] → The dramatic displays serve as interpersonal strategies to maintain attention and control; rooted in a core belief that "I am inadequate unless I can capture others' attention"
- ***Often suggestible, especially by figures of authority*** [2] → Reflects poor self-structure and identity dependence on external validation
- ***Seek attention and excitement, easily bored, have short-lived enthusiasm and shallow, labile affect*** [2] → The shallow affect reflects that emotional displays are performative rather than deeply felt; the boredom reflects understimulated noradrenergic/reward systems
- ***Self-centred with marked capacity for self-deception*** to convince themselves of their own fabrications [2]
- ***Over-concerned with physical attractiveness*** [2] → Physical appearance is the primary tool for gaining attention
- ***Seek intimacy and inappropriately seductive*** [2] → Sexualization of relationships as the primary means of relating to others (per Freud's model)

#### 6.2.4 Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)

| Domain | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prevalence** | Lifetime ~6.2%, M > F [2] |
| **Heritability** | > 0.6 [2] |
| **Neurobiology** | Structural differences in **neural circuitry for empathy** [2] |
| **Associations** | Depression (20.6%), Bipolar I (20.1%), anxiety (54.7%), substance abuse (64.2%) [2] |

**Clinical Features (with pathophysiology):**

- ***Grandiose sense of self-importance, considers self as deserving of special treatment*** — rigid, inflexible but **easily threatened** (very dependent on feedback) [2] → The grandiosity is a defensive structure protecting a fragile, insecure inner self. When the narcissistic "supply" (admiration, attention) is cut off, the person decompensates
- ***Boastful and pretentious with excessive need for admiration*** (e.g., need to be the centre of attention) [2]
- ***Superficial and exploitative relationships***, with only value being **self-enhancement** (e.g., associating with rich, famous people) [2]
- ***Lack of empathy***: even if attuned to others' reactions, only does so **to serve own needs** [2] → Neural circuitry for empathy is structurally different → cognitive empathy may be intact (can read emotions) but affective empathy is deficient (doesn't feel what others feel)
- ***Chronic emptiness and boredom when without positive feedback***, but feel **vulnerable during life transitions** [2]
- **Subtypes** [2]:
  - **High-functioning**: Successful, charismatic, but interpersonally exploitative
  - **Grandiose/overt** ("thick-skinned"): Classic presentation — boastful, entitled, dismissive
  - **Vulnerable/covert** ("thin-skinned"): Shy, hypersensitive to criticism, easily hurt, chronic feelings of emptiness
- ***Associated with significant risk of suicide and substance use*** [2]

<Callout title="The Two Faces of Narcissism">
Don't think of NPD as just the grandiose, self-important person. The **vulnerable/covert subtype** presents very differently — with social withdrawal, hypersensitivity, and depression. It can be mistaken for avoidant PD or depression. The key distinguishing feature is the **underlying sense of entitlement and envy** that becomes apparent on deeper assessment.

### 6.3 Cluster C — The Anxious/Fearful Cluster

These disorders share features with **anxiety disorders**. The core pathology is **fear and avoidance**, but it is pervasive and trait-like rather than episodic.

#### 6.3.1 Avoidant (Anxious) Personality Disorder

| Domain | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prevalence** | ~2.36%, M = F [2] |
| **Associations** | Temperament of **behavioural inhibition** [2]; childhood **emotional neglect** and **peer group rejection** [2] |

**Clinical Features (with pathophysiology):**

- ***Avoids interpersonal contact for fears of criticism, disapproval, rejection unless certain of being liked*** [2] → Core cognitive schema: "I am fundamentally inadequate and will be rejected if others see the real me"
- ***Preoccupied with criticism/rejection in social situations*** [2] → Attention bias toward threat cues (similar to social anxiety disorder)
- ***Persistently tense, insecure, and lacks self-esteem*** [2]
- ***Feels socially inferior, inept, unappealing*** [2]
- ***Has few close friends but craves social relationships*** [2] → This is the key difference from schizoid PD (who doesn't want relationships)

**Avoidant PD vs. Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)**: There is enormous overlap. Some experts consider avoidant PD to be the more severe, generalized end of the social anxiety spectrum. The main distinction is that avoidant PD involves **pervasive feelings of inadequacy and inferiority** across all life domains, while SAD is more specifically related to **fear of social performance situations**. In practice, many patients meet criteria for both.

#### 6.3.2 Dependent Personality Disorder

| Domain | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prevalence** | ~0.49%, F > M [2] |
| **Heritability** | 0.55-0.72 [2] |
| **Associations** | **Overprotective and authoritarian parenting**; **early traumatic experiences** [2] |

**Clinical Features (with pathophysiology):**

- ***Pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of***, sometimes going to **excessive lengths to obtain such care** [2] → Core schema: "I am helpless and cannot survive on my own." This likely develops from overprotective parenting that never allowed autonomy (Erikson stage 2 failure: autonomy vs. shame)
- ***Unduly compliant with difficulty making direct demands or disagreeing*** with other people [2] → Fear that assertiveness will lead to abandonment
- ***Lacks confidence and therefore avoids responsibility*** [2]
- ***Often protected by a more energetic partner*** [2] → Classic dynamic: the dependent person pairs with a controlling or narcissistic partner
- ***Often preoccupied with fears of being left alone*** and ***urgently seeks another relationship when an earlier one ended*** [2] → "Relationship hopping" — the person cannot tolerate being alone

#### 6.3.3 Obsessive-Compulsive (Anankastic) Personality Disorder (OCPD)

| Domain | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prevalence** | ~2.1-7.9%, M > F (2:1) [2] |
| **Associations** | Asperger's and eating disorders; genetics (**DRD3** gene); triggered by **trauma**; **overprotective or over-involved parenting** [2] |
| **ICD-10 name** | **Anankastic** personality disorder (from Greek ἀνάγκη = "necessity, compulsion") |

**Clinical Features (with pathophysiology):**

- ***Preoccupied with orderliness, perfectionism, and control*** at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency → Core schema: "The world is unpredictable and dangerous; I must maintain control at all times to prevent catastrophe"
- **Excessive devotion to work and productivity** to the exclusion of leisure and friendships
- **Over-conscientiousness, scrupulosity, inflexibility** about matters of morality, ethics, or values
- **Inability to discard worn-out or worthless objects** (hoarding — but this is different from Hoarding Disorder)
- **Reluctance to delegate tasks** unless they submit to exactly their way of doing things
- **Miserliness** (money viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes)
- **Rigidity and stubbornness**
- ***Preoccupation with details, rules, lists, order*** to the extent that the major point of activity is lost

<Callout title="OCPD vs. OCD — Critical Distinction" type="error">
This is **the** most commonly confused distinction in personality disorders:
- **OCD**: The person has **ego-dystonic** obsessions (intrusive, unwanted thoughts that cause distress) and compulsions (repetitive behaviours to reduce anxiety). The person **recognizes** these as excessive and unwanted.
- **OCPD**: The person has **ego-syntonic** personality traits (perfectionism, control, orderliness). They **do not see these as a problem** — indeed, they often see themselves as more "correct" than others. There are no true obsessions or compulsions.
- OCPD is a personality disorder (pervasive, lifelong). OCD is an anxiety-related disorder (episodic, with specific obsessions/compulsions).
- Interestingly, most OCD patients do NOT have OCPD, and most OCPD patients do NOT have OCD.

## 7. Approach to Personality Disorders in Clinical Practice

This section covers how you actually deal with PDs in the real clinical world [2].

### 7.1 Presentation
- Most patients with PDs **do not present complaining of their personality** [2]
- They typically present **at times of stress and distress**, because the ***majority tend not to regard their own personality as inherently abnormal*** [2]
- Common presentations include:
  - Crisis (self-harm, relationship breakdown, legal issues)
  - Comorbid psychiatric illness (depression, anxiety, substance use)
  - Referred by others (employer, family, courts)

### 7.2 Diagnosis
- ***Clinicians often agree on the presence of PD but disagree on subtype*** [2] — this highlights the limitations of the categorical system
- Requires **longitudinal assessment** (not just cross-sectional mental state exam)
- **Collateral history** is essential (the patient may not have insight into their own personality patterns)
- Must distinguish from Axis I disorders that can mimic PD features (e.g., chronic depression can look like depressive personality traits)

### 7.3 Assessment Should Cover [2]:
1. **Source of distress**: Thoughts, emotions, behaviour, relationships — to self AND to others
2. **Functional impairment**: At work, at home, in social circumstances
3. **Comorbid psychiatric illness**: Always screen for depression, anxiety, substance use, PTSD
4. **Strengths and weaknesses** of the individual → important for subsequent treatment planning

### 7.4 Management Principles [2]

**Aim**: Seek a way of life that **conflicts less with their character**, often by:
- ↓Contact with situations provoking difficulties
- ↑Opportunity to develop assets in their personality

**Form**: **Psychological support as mainstay**, with multidisciplinary input

**Techniques** [2]:
- **Psychotherapy**: Psychodynamic therapy, cognitive therapy — when **well-motivated and stable**
  - **Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT)**: The gold standard for borderline PD — combines CBT with mindfulness and distress tolerance skills; developed by Marsha Linehan specifically for BPD
  - **Mentalization-Based Therapy (MBT)**: Developed by Bateman & Fonagy for BPD — focuses on improving the capacity to understand one's own and others' mental states
  - **Schema Therapy**: Integrative approach addressing early maladaptive schemas — evidence for BPD and Cluster C PDs
  - **Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP)**: Psychodynamic approach for BPD — works with the therapeutic relationship to address splitting and other defence mechanisms
- **Drugs**: As **adjunct only** to treat **comorbid psychiatric disorders** [2]
  - No medication is "approved" for personality disorders per se
  - SSRIs may help with depressive symptoms, impulsivity, and anxiety
  - Mood stabilizers (e.g., valproate, lamotrigine) for mood instability and impulsivity in BPD
  - Low-dose antipsychotics for transient psychotic symptoms or severe agitation
  - **Avoid benzodiazepines** (especially in BPD — paradoxical disinhibition; dependence risk in Cluster C)
- **Evidence**: ***Little hard evidence to support current management, mainly focusing on Cluster B*** [2]

## 8. Specific Comorbidities and Associations Worth Knowing

| Personality Disorder | Key Comorbidities |
|---|---|
| **Paranoid PD** | Delusional disorder, depression, substance abuse |
| **Schizotypal PD** | Schizophrenia (10-25% conversion), depression, social anxiety |
| **Antisocial PD** | Substance use disorders (very high), forensic issues, ASPD has 70% comorbidity with substance use |
| **Borderline PD** | Depression (83%), substance use (64%), PTSD (56%), eating disorders (53%), anxiety disorders |
| **Narcissistic PD** | Depression (20.6%), Bipolar I (20.1%), anxiety (54.7%), substance abuse (64.2%) [2] |
| **Avoidant PD** | Social anxiety disorder, depression |
| **Dependent PD** | Depression, anxiety disorders |
| **OCPD** | Eating disorders, Asperger's syndrome [2] |

## 9. Personality and Its Role in Other Psychiatric Conditions (Cross-References)

This integrates personality into the broader psychiatric curriculum:

- **Depression**: ***Neuroticism*** is a risk factor for depression and may represent a milder form of the disease [3][4]. ***Sociotropy*** (strong need for approval) predisposes to depression [3]. Personality disorders (esp. **borderline, obsessive-compulsive**) are predisposing factors [3].

- **Bipolar Disorder**: ***Low care and overprotective parents, poor attachment relationship*** are risk factors [8][9]. Personality interacts with the course and presentation of bipolar illness.

- **Anxiety Disorders**: ***Behavioural inhibition*** (timid and shy in novel situations) is a temperamental precursor to GAD and other anxiety disorders [6]. **Personality disorders** are commonly comorbid with anxiety.

- **Substance Use Disorders** [5]:
  - ***Sensation-seeking, impulsive personality traits, more extrovert → predispose to experiment with both licit and illicit drugs***
  - ***Obsessional, dependent or anxious → more likely to get dependent and difficult to stop***
  - **Antisocial PD** is the personality disorder most strongly associated with substance use

- **PTSD**: Associated with ***neurotic personality*** [10]. Personality factors partly mediate the genetic susceptibility to PTSD [10].

- **OCD**: Share some genetic overlap with OCPD, but they are distinct entities [11].

- **Schizophrenia**: Shares genetic risk with **schizotypal** and **paranoid** personality disorder [7]. First-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients have higher rates of Cluster A PDs.

- **Somatic Symptom Disorders**: Often co-occur with personality pathology, especially **dependent**, **histrionic**, and **borderline** traits [12].

---

## 10. Prognosis

- **Cluster A**: Tends to be **stable** throughout life. Schizotypal PD has risk of progression to schizophrenia (10-25%).
- **Cluster B**: Most improvement with age:
  - **Antisocial PD**: Behavioural features (criminality, impulsivity) tend to "burn out" after age 40, but interpersonal deficits persist
  - **Borderline PD**: Many patients show significant improvement over 10-year follow-up (remission rates ~85-90% over 10 years), but functional impairment may persist even after remission of acute symptoms
  - **Narcissistic PD**: Presentation often prompted by depression from **dissolved romantic relationships** [2]; treatment often involves cognitive therapy and functional analytic psychotherapy
- **Cluster C**: May improve with psychotherapy but traits tend to persist. Often complicated by comorbid anxiety/depression.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Definition**: Personality disorders = enduring, inflexible, maladaptive personality patterns causing distress/impairment, present from late adolescence/early adulthood.

**Classification**:
- **DSM-5**: Three clusters (A-Odd, B-Dramatic, C-Anxious) with 10 specific PDs
- **ICD-11**: Dimensional model (severity + trait qualifiers: Negative Affectivity, Detachment, Dissociality, Disinhibition, Anankastia) + Borderline pattern qualifier

**Key Distinctions**:
- Schizoid (doesn't want relationships) vs. Avoidant (wants but fears rejection)
- OCPD (ego-syntonic, personality trait) vs. OCD (ego-dystonic, anxiety disorder)
- BPD mood lability (hours, triggered, emptiness baseline) vs. Bipolar (days-weeks, grandiosity, euthymic baseline)
- ASPD (behavioural criteria) vs. Psychopathy (interpersonal/affective)

**Cluster A**: Odd/Eccentric → Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal. Think schizophrenia spectrum.
**Cluster B**: Dramatic/Emotional → Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, Narcissistic. Think emotional dysregulation + impulsivity.
**Cluster C**: Anxious/Fearful → Avoidant, Dependent, OCPD. Think anxiety spectrum.

**Aetiology**: Biopsychosocial — genetics (35-50% heritability for traits), temperament, attachment, childhood adversity, cognitive schemas, neurobiology (serotonin, dopamine, prefrontal-amygdala circuits).

**Management**: Psychological therapy is mainstay (DBT for BPD, MBT, Schema Therapy). Medications are adjuncts for comorbid conditions only. No medication is "approved" for PD per se.

**Most clinically important**: Borderline PD (highest evidence base, most treatable with DBT/MBT, highest suicide risk among PDs).

      question: "What is the fundamental difference between schizoid personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder in terms of social relationships?",
      markscheme: "Schizoid: genuinely does not desire social relationships, no distress from isolation. Avoidant: desires social relationships but avoids them due to fear of rejection/criticism, experiences significant distress. Both are socially isolated but the mechanism and subjective experience differ completely."
    },
    {

      markscheme: "OCPD is ego-syntonic (person sees traits as desirable/correct), pervasive personality pattern of perfectionism, control, orderliness without true obsessions/compulsions. OCD is ego-dystonic (intrusive unwanted thoughts causing distress + compulsions to relieve anxiety). They do NOT commonly co-occur - most OCD patients do not have OCPD and vice versa."

      question: "A patient with borderline personality disorder has rapid mood shifts lasting hours, triggered by interpersonal conflicts, with a baseline of chronic emptiness. How do you distinguish this from bipolar disorder?",
      markscheme: "BPD: mood shifts last hours (not days/weeks), triggered by interpersonal events, baseline is emptiness/dysphoria, no true mania (no grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity). Bipolar: mood episodes last days to weeks, may be spontaneous, mania involves elevated mood/grandiosity/decreased sleep, euthymic baseline between episodes. They can co-exist."
    },
    {
      question: "What is Linehan's Biosocial Model of Borderline Personality Disorder?",
      markscheme: "Two factors: 1) Biological vulnerability = innate emotional vulnerability (high sensitivity, high reactivity, slow return to baseline from emotional arousal). 2) Invalidating environment = childhood environment that dismisses, punishes, or ignores the child's emotional experiences. Result: child never learns to regulate emotions, leading to emotional dysregulation as core pathology from which all BPD features derive."
    },
    {
      question: "List three ways personality is important in psychiatry beyond being a disorder itself.",
      markscheme: "1. Predisposition: modifies individual response to stressors, predisposing to certain disorders (e.g. neuroticism to depression). 2. Pathoplastic factor: colours the clinical presentation of psychiatric conditions (e.g. rumination in depression with obsessional personality). 3. Treatment-related: determines attitude towards treatment and relationship with therapist (e.g. Cluster B traits causing difficult therapeutic relationships)."
