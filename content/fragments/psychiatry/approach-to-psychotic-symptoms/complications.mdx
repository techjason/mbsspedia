## Complications of Psychotic Disorders

Complications of psychosis are not just "things that go wrong" — they are the **inevitable downstream consequences** of a chronic brain disorder that impairs thinking, motivation, social engagement, and physical self-care, compounded by the side effects of the very medications used to treat it. Understanding complications from first principles means tracing each one back to either the **disease process itself**, the **treatment**, or the **interaction between illness and society**.

These complications fall into five broad domains:
1. **Psychiatric complications** (suicide, comorbidity, treatment resistance)
2. **Physical health complications** (metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, medication side effects)
3. **Cognitive and functional complications** (progressive decline, disability)
4. **Social complications** (stigma, homelessness, legal issues, caregiver burden)
5. **Treatment-related complications** (medication side effects, NMS, tardive dyskinesia)

### 1. Psychiatric Complications

#### 1.1 Suicide

This is the most devastating and preventable complication of psychotic disorders.

- ***Suicide is the single largest cause of premature death in schizophrenia*** [1][2]
- ***5.6% lifetime suicide rate*** (based on first-episode cohorts); ***4.9% from all studies*** [1]
- ***Risk is highest in the early stage of psychotic disorders*** [1]
- ***Rate is highest in the first year after presentation of FEP (first-episode psychosis)*** [1]
- ***Suicide risk of psychotic patients is 12 times more than expected from the general population*** [1]
- ***Depressed mood, one of the strongest predictors of suicide, is frequently observed in the early stage of illness*** [1]

*Why is the risk highest early in the illness?*
- The patient may retain enough insight to recognise the devastating implications of their diagnosis — loss of career prospects, relationships, identity. This "insight-depression paradox" is a known phenomenon: recovery of insight into illness and its problems in the post-psychotic phase can itself precipitate depression and suicidality [2].
- Depressed mood is extremely common early in schizophrenia — it may be an integral part of the illness, a reaction to emerging insight, or a medication side effect [2].
- Patients who were previously high-functioning (e.g., young men with good education) are ***particularly at risk*** because the gap between their premorbid expectations and their post-illness reality is greatest [2].

**Risk factors for suicide in psychosis** [2]:
- Depressed mood (strongest predictor)
- First year of illness / first episode
- Young, male, previously high-functioning
- Previous suicide attempts
- Substance abuse (comorbid)
- Command hallucinations (voices telling patient to harm themselves)
- Persecutory delusions (sense of being trapped)
- Poor adherence to treatment
- Social isolation
- Recent discharge from hospital (transition period with reduced support)

<Callout title="Suicide After Hospital Discharge" type="error">
The period immediately following discharge from a psychiatric ward is one of the highest-risk periods for suicide. The patient transitions from a structured, supervised environment to the community, often with incomplete recovery and inadequate follow-up. This is why the ***EASY programme*** and other early intervention services emphasise ***intensive follow-up*** in the community — to bridge this dangerous gap [2].
</Callout>

#### 1.2 Comorbid Depression (Post-Schizophrenia Depression)

- ***25% of schizophrenia patients suffer from post-schizophrenia depression*** [2]
- Explanations include [2]:
  1. Depression may be an ***integral part of the schizophrenic illness*** (shared neurobiology — both involve monoamine dysfunction)
  2. May result from ***recovery of insight*** into illness and its consequences in the post-psychotic phase
  3. May be a ***side effect of medications*** (especially FGAs causing secondary negative symptoms that mimic depression)
- Significance: depression ↑suicide risk, ↑functional impairment, ↓quality of life, ↓medication compliance

#### 1.3 Comorbid Substance Abuse

- ***30% of schizophrenia patients abuse alcohol*** [12]
- ***Alcohol temporarily decreases feelings of isolation and reduces symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia*** in schizophrenic patients [12]
- However, alcohol ***increases psychotic symptoms and mood swings*** [12]
- Consequences [12]:
  - ***Disruptive behaviour, suicide***
  - ***Treatment non-compliance***
  - ***Drug abuse*** (gateway effect)
  - ***Poor clinical outcome***
  - ***Drug accumulation due to hepatic damage*** (liver impairment from alcohol alters metabolism of antipsychotics)
- Cannabis, methamphetamine, and other stimulants are also commonly abused — all worsen psychotic symptoms via dopaminergic mechanisms
- ***Comorbid substance abuse is a poor prognostic factor*** [1][2]

#### 1.4 Treatment Resistance

- ***30% of schizophrenia patients are treatment-resistant*** [2]
- Even with clozapine (the gold standard for TRS), ***only ~30% respond*** [2]
- This means approximately ***10% of all schizophrenia patients fail all available pharmacological treatments***
- Treatment resistance is associated with:
  - More severe illness at onset
  - Prominent negative and cognitive symptoms
  - Prolonged DUP
  - Poor premorbid adjustment
  - Substance abuse

#### 1.5 Relapse

- ***High risk of relapse*** after medication discontinuation [11]
- ***Major risk factor for relapse: non-adherence to medication*** [11]
- Non-compliance is ***very common (up to 52%)***, with risk factors including ***poor insight and negative attitudes to medication*** [2]
- Each relapse is thought to cause further neurological damage — the ***neuroprogression theory*** [13]:
  - ***Worse prognosis with frequent relapses*** [13]
  - Progressive structural brain changes with each episode
  - ***Increased risk of future development of dementia*** [13]

<Callout title="Neuroprogression in Psychosis">
***Neuroprogression theory*** proposes that each psychotic episode causes incremental, potentially irreversible brain damage [13]. This is supported by the observation that ***active psychosis is neurotoxic and delayed treatment leads to irreversible neurological deterioration*** [2]. This is the fundamental rationale for:
1. Minimising ***duration of untreated psychosis (DUP)***
2. ***Early intervention*** (EASY programme)
3. ***Maintenance antipsychotic treatment*** to prevent relapse
4. Aggressive treatment of breakthrough symptoms
</Callout>

### 2. Physical Health Complications

#### 2.1 Premature Mortality from Medical Causes

- ***Lifespan reduced by 10–15 years on average*** [2]
- ***2.6× all-cause mortality***, with the ***majority being non-suicidal*** causes [2]

The reasons are multifactorial [2]:

| Factor | Mechanism | Examples |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Lifestyle** | ***Sedentary behaviour, poor nutrition*** | Negative symptoms (avolition, apathy) → patients lack motivation to exercise or eat healthily |
| **Substance use** | ***Smoking, substance/alcohol abuse*** | ~60–80% of schizophrenia patients smoke (vs ~20% general population). Nicotine may partially self-medicate cognitive symptoms (nicotinic receptor stimulation ↑attention). Smoking → lung cancer, COPD, CVD |
| **Medication side effects** | ***Metabolic syndrome related to 2nd-generation antipsychotics*** | Weight gain, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia → diabetes, CVD, stroke |
| **Inherent disease process** | ***?Accelerated ageing, ↑medical morbidity*** | Emerging evidence of accelerated biological ageing in schizophrenia (telomere shortening, oxidative stress) |
| **Healthcare access** | Diagnostic overshadowing, poor help-seeking | Physical complaints attributed to psychiatric illness ("it's just his schizophrenia"); patients less likely to seek medical care; physicians less likely to investigate |

#### 2.2 Metabolic Syndrome

This is the most important *iatrogenic* physical complication — directly caused by the medications we prescribe:

- ***Higher risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia) than the general population*** [13]
- ***Risk factors for medical comorbidity*** [13]:
  - ***Alcohol and substance use***
  - ***Unhealthy diet***
  - ***Physical inactivity***
  - ***Social isolation, unemployment, and low education and socioeconomic status***
  - ***Stress***
  - ***Poor sleep and mental health***
  - ***Childhood abuse***
  - ***Side effects of pharmacotherapy, e.g., sodium valproate, atypical antipsychotics*** [13]

The worst offenders for metabolic side effects are ***clozapine*** and ***olanzapine*** (+++ weight gain, diabetes, dyslipidaemia), followed by ***quetiapine*** (++) and ***risperidone*** (++) [2]. ***Aripiprazole*** and ***lurasidone*** are the most metabolically neutral [2].

*Why do SGAs cause metabolic syndrome?* They antagonise 5-HT2C receptors and H1 receptors in the hypothalamus, disrupting appetite regulation and energy homeostasis → ↑food intake, ↓satiety, ↑fat deposition (especially visceral). They also have direct effects on pancreatic beta cells (↓insulin secretion) and on hepatic lipid metabolism.

**Metabolic monitoring** is therefore mandatory [2]:
- ***BMI, glucose, lipid profile, blood pressure regularly, especially for those on SGA***
- Typically: baseline → 3 months → 6 months → annually

#### 2.3 Cardiovascular Disease

- Leading cause of excess non-suicidal mortality in schizophrenia
- Driven by metabolic syndrome (above) + smoking + sedentary lifestyle
- ***QTc prolongation*** from antipsychotics (especially ***amisulpride, haloperidol IV, ziprasidone***) → risk of ***torsades de pointes*** → sudden cardiac death [2]
- ***Myocarditis/cardiomyopathy*** — rare but serious complication of ***clozapine*** (usually within first month) [2]

---

### 3. Cognitive and Functional Complications

#### 3.1 Cognitive Impairment

***Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia*** and represents one of the most disabling aspects of the illness [1]:

- ***A core feature in schizophrenia*** [1]
- ***Key determinant of functional outcome*** [1]
- ***Unmet therapeutic need, not responsive to antipsychotic treatment*** [1]
- ***Generalised cognitive impairment encompassing multiple cognitive domains*** [1]:
  - ***Sustained attention***
  - ***Executive functions (planning, set-shifting, inhibition control)***
  - ***Working memory***
  - ***Verbal and visual memory (immediate registration and recall)***
  - ***Processing speed***
- ***In general, 1–2 standard deviations below normal healthy controls*** [1]
- ***Healthy first-degree relatives of patients also demonstrate deficits (albeit less severe) in cognition*** [1] — suggesting cognitive impairment is related to genetic vulnerability, not just the illness itself
- ***Impairment in social cognition*** observed, including ***deficits in theory of mind (ToM), emotion recognition, etc.*** [1]

*Why is this so devastating functionally?* Cognitive impairment affects every domain of daily life — the ability to hold a job (sustained attention, executive function), manage finances (working memory, planning), maintain relationships (social cognition, ToM), and live independently. Unlike positive symptoms, which respond well to antipsychotics, cognitive impairment is ***not responsive to current treatments*** and is the primary driver of long-term disability.

#### 3.2 Functional Impairment and Disability

- Schizophrenia is the ***No. 12 leading disability worldwide*** and accounts for ***substantial direct and indirect costs*** [2]
- Functional impairment encompasses:
  - **Occupational**: inability to maintain employment (most devastating in young-onset illness)
  - **Social**: social withdrawal, inability to maintain relationships
  - **Self-care**: poor hygiene, nutrition, housing management (driven by negative symptoms)
  - **Educational**: onset in adolescence/early adulthood disrupts education at the most critical period
- ***> 50% have poor outcome*** [2]
- Functional outcome is more closely correlated with ***negative symptoms and cognitive impairment*** than with positive symptoms [1][2]

#### 3.3 Progressive Cognitive Decline and Dementia Risk

The ***staging of illness*** concept from bipolar disorder research also applies to schizophrenia [13]:
- ***Stage 1***: high-risk group or subsyndromal symptoms
- ***Stage 2***: few episodes, optimal functioning
- ***Stage 3***: recurrent episodes and ***decline in functioning and cognition***
- ***Neuroprogression theory: worse prognosis with frequent relapses*** [13]
- ***Increased risk of future development of dementia*** [13]

This is consistent with the observation that each psychotic episode is associated with progressive grey matter loss and ventricular enlargement.

### 4. Social Complications

#### 4.1 Stigma and Discrimination

- Despite the renaming to 思覺失調 in Hong Kong (2001) to reduce stigma, psychotic disorders remain heavily stigmatised
- Patients face discrimination in employment, housing, relationships, and healthcare
- Self-stigma (internalised shame) further worsens depression, social withdrawal, and treatment non-adherence
- Stigma is one of the main barriers to help-seeking, especially in Asian cultures

#### 4.2 Homelessness and Poverty

- Psychotic disorders are over-represented among homeless populations
- The combination of functional impairment, unemployment, social isolation, and poor family support creates a downward spiral
- In Hong Kong, social welfare support and halfway houses are critical safety nets

#### 4.3 Violence and Legal Issues

- Patients with psychotic disorders have a modestly increased risk of violence compared to the general population — but the absolute risk remains low
- Risk is primarily driven by: ***comorbid substance abuse***, acute positive symptoms (especially persecutory delusions with perceived threat, command hallucinations), and treatment non-adherence
- The much greater issue is that patients with psychosis are far more likely to be ***victims*** of violence than perpetrators

#### 4.4 Caregiver Burden

- Caring for a family member with chronic psychosis is enormously stressful
- ***High expressed emotions (EE) of caregivers*** — ***critical, hostile, emotionally over-involved attitudes*** — are both a consequence of caregiver stress AND a cause of patient relapse (***↑risk of relapse if exposed to high EE > 35 hours/week***) [2]
- ***Family intervention*** (psychoeducation, expressed emotion reduction, support) is a core component of management precisely because it addresses this vicious cycle [11]

---

### 5. Treatment-Related Complications

These have been covered in detail in the management section but are summarised here for completeness as they represent a major source of morbidity:

| Complication | Mechanism | Offending Agents | Consequences |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Extrapyramidal side effects** | D2 blockade in nigrostriatal pathway | High-potency FGAs (haloperidol), risperidone | Acute dystonia, parkinsonism, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia |
| **Tardive dyskinesia** | Chronic D2 blockade → receptor upregulation → supersensitivity | All antipsychotics (especially long-term FGAs) | Irreversible involuntary orofacial movements; profoundly stigmatising |
| ***Neuroleptic malignant syndrome*** | Sudden severe D2 blockade in hypothalamus + nigrostriatal | Any antipsychotic (especially high-potency, rapid dose escalation) | ***Mortality up to 20% if untreated*** [2] |
| **Metabolic syndrome** | H1, 5-HT2C antagonism → appetite dysregulation; direct metabolic effects | Clozapine, olanzapine > quetiapine, risperidone | Obesity, diabetes, dyslipidaemia → CVD |
| **Hyperprolactinaemia** | D2 blockade in tuberoinfundibular pathway → loss of tonic prolactin inhibition | Amisulpride, risperidone, paliperidone, haloperidol | Galactorrhoea, amenorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis (long-term) |
| **QTc prolongation** | Blockade of cardiac hERG potassium channels | Amisulpride, haloperidol (IV), ziprasidone | Torsades de pointes → sudden cardiac death |
| **Sedation** | H1 antagonism | Chlorpromazine, quetiapine, olanzapine, clozapine | Falls (especially elderly), cognitive impairment, reduced functioning |
| ***Agranulocytosis*** | Immune-mediated destruction of neutrophils | ***Clozapine*** (risk ~1%, especially first 18 weeks) | Life-threatening infection if not detected; mandatory monitoring [2] |
| **Constipation / functional ileus** | Antimuscarinic effects on GI smooth muscle | ***Clozapine*** | Can be fatal if not recognised; clozapine-related bowel obstruction is a significant cause of death |
| ***Myocarditis / cardiomyopathy*** | Direct toxic effect on myocardium (mechanism not fully understood) | ***Clozapine*** (usually first month) | Chest pain, dyspnoea, fever, tachycardia; can be fatal |

<Callout title="The Underappreciated Danger of Clozapine-Related Constipation" type="error">
Clozapine causes severe constipation in up to 60% of patients due to potent antimuscarinic effects on gut motility. This can progress to ***functional intestinal obstruction (paralytic ileus)***, bowel perforation, and death. Clozapine-related GI complications may actually cause ***more deaths than agranulocytosis*** in some series. Always assess bowel function in patients on clozapine, prescribe laxatives prophylactically, and educate patients and carers.
</Callout>

### 6. Complications Related to Mood Disorders with Psychotic Features

For completeness, since psychosis can arise from mood disorders [13]:

**Bipolar disorder complications:**
- ***Poor prognosis: only < 20% achieve a 5-year period of clinical stability*** [2]
- ***Poor prognostic factors***: ***early onset, greater severity, mixed episodes, repeated episodes, previous hospitalisations, residual symptoms, cognitive impairment, poor insight, side effects of medications, comorbid substance or personality disorder*** [13]
- ***Mortality significantly ↑; ↓life expectancy by ~13 years (M) and 9 years (F)*** [2]
- ***Suicide: ~8% (M) and 5% (F) hospitalised patients die by suicide over 40 years*** [2]
- ***Medical comorbidity: ↑CVS disease/metabolic syndrome*** (medication side effects, poor lifestyle), consequences of comorbid substance abuse and smoking [2]

**Underdiagnosis complications** [13]:
- ***The distress caused by untreated mood symptoms results in increased suicidality, comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders*** [13]
- ***Poor QOL, greater functional impairment, and increased healthcare cost*** [13]
- ***Antidepressant monotherapy is less effective and results in manic switch and cycle acceleration*** [13]

---

### 7. Course and Prognosis Summary

***Course: highly heterogeneous, usually chronic and relapsing-remitting*** [2]

***Prognosis: 30% treatment-resistant, 20% remission, 10% suicide, > 50% have poor outcome*** [2]

***Poor prognostic factors*** [1][2]:

| Patient Factors | Disease Factors | Other Factors |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ***Poor premorbid adjustment*** [1] | ***Insidious onset of psychosis*** [1] | ***High expressed emotions (EE) of caregivers*** [1] |
| ***Early onset / young age of onset*** [1] | ***Prolonged duration of untreated psychosis (DUP)*** [1] | ***Comorbid substance abuse*** [1] |
| ***Male gender*** [1] | ***Prominent negative symptoms*** [1] | ***Poor initial treatment response to antipsychotic medication*** [1] |
| Single [2] | ***Severe cognitive impairment*** [1] | Poor treatment adherence [2] |
| Family history [2] | ***Hebephrenic subtype*** [1] | |
| | Prominent affective symptoms [2] | |
| | Poor insight [2] | |

Positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinations) respond well to antipsychotics (over 80% FEP response), but cognitive impairment is an unmet therapeutic need not responsive to antipsychotic treatment. Even when positive symptoms are controlled, persistent cognitive deficits prevent patients from returning to functional independence. Healthy first-degree relatives also show milder deficits, suggesting cognitive impairment reflects core genetic vulnerability rather than a treatable symptom."

Mechanism: clozapine has potent antimuscarinic effects on GI smooth muscle — blocks muscarinic M3 receptors → reduced peristalsis → severe constipation → ileus → potential bowel perforation and death. This is a significantly underappreciated complication — may cause more deaths than agranulocytosis in some series. Management: prophylactic laxatives for all clozapine patients, regular assessment of bowel function, urgent surgical review if ileus suspected."
