## Complications of Depressive Disorders

Depression is not just a "mood problem." It is a systemic illness with complications that span every domain of a patient's life — psychiatric, medical, social, and even cognitive-neurodegenerative. Understanding these complications is essential because they explain *why* depression carries such a high burden of disability and mortality, and why aggressive treatment matters.

Let's work through each category systematically, connecting every complication back to the underlying pathophysiology.

---

### 1. Suicide and Self-Harm — The Most Feared Complication

This is the complication that keeps psychiatrists up at night and the one you will be examined on most heavily.

#### 1.1 Scale of the Problem

***Depression raises suicidal risk. Increase in suicide risk attributable to depression was 20-fold.*** [1]

***Suicide was the cause of death in 6% of patients with an affective disorder, and the risk would be even higher in those with psychiatric co-morbidities.*** [1]

***In a longitudinal study in Sweden spanning over half a century, the long-term suicide risk in subjects with depression was 6.0% after 54–64 years of follow-up.*** [1]

***Mortality: > 20× risk of suicide; can approach 15% in those severe admitted cases.*** [2]

***Over 700,000 people commit suicide every year and many more attempt suicide. One of the major causes of suicide is depression.*** [1]

#### 1.2 Hong Kong Context

***Depression accounts for a significant proportion of suicides in adults in Hong Kong:*** [1]
- ***Using a case-control psychological autopsy method, 150 local suicide decedents aged 15–59 were compared with 150 randomly selected age- and gender-matched controls***
- ***In the presence of non-disease-related social risk factors (unemployment and unmanageable debt), current major depressive disorder independently accounted for 27% of the population-attributable risk of suicide***

***Depression accounts for a significant proportion of suicides in older adults in Hong Kong:*** [1]
- ***70 decedents aged 60 or above who had committed suicide were compared with 100 elderly controls***
- ***86% of suicide subjects suffered from a psychiatric problem before committing suicide, compared with 9% of control subjects***
- ***Among the psychiatric problems, major depression was the commonest diagnosis***

#### 1.3 Why Depression Causes Suicide — The Pathophysiological Chain

The path from depression to suicide involves convergence of multiple factors:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Depressive Disorder"] --> B["Hopelessness<br/>(strongest cognitive predictor)"]
    A --> C["↓ Serotonin in<br/>ventral PFC"]
    A --> D["Psychic pain<br/>(unbearable suffering)"]
    A --> E["Psychotic features<br/>(command hallucinations,<br/>nihilistic delusions)"]
    B --> F["Desire to die<br/>(suicidal ideation)"]
    C --> G["↑ Impulsivity<br/>↑ Aggression"]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> H{"Protective factors?<br/>(family, religion,<br/>reasons to live)"}
    H -- Insufficient --> I["Suicidal Plan<br/>→ Access to Means<br/>→ Attempt"]
    G --> I
    H -- Sufficient --> J["Ideation without<br/>progression"]
```

Key mechanistic points:
- **Hopelessness** (Beck's cognitive triad — negative view of future) is the single strongest predictor of suicidal behaviour, even more than depression severity itself
- **↓ 5-HT in ventral PFC** → impaired impulse control and increased aggression, including self-directed aggression. Post-mortem studies of suicide decedents consistently show ↓ 5-HT and ↓ 5-HIAA (serotonin metabolite) in CSF
- **Psychotic features** dramatically increase risk — command auditory hallucinations telling the patient to kill themselves, or nihilistic delusions (Cotard's syndrome) making the patient believe they are already dead or that their organs are rotting
- The critical **"dangerous window"** occurs in early antidepressant treatment (first 1–2 weeks) when energy returns before mood lifts — a previously too-apathetic patient now has the drive to act on suicidal thoughts

#### 1.4 Suicide Risk Spectrum

***Suicide can be understood as a spectrum and should be approached in a gradual manner:*** [2]
1. ***Depressed mood***
2. ***Negative thoughts: guilt → worthlessness → hopelessness***
3. ***Death wish: passive*** ("I don't care if I wake up tomorrow") ***→ active*** (active suicidal means considered)
4. ***Suicidal acts: plans and preparations → attempts***

***34% of suicidal ideation becomes plans; 72% of suicidal plans become attempts. Passive ideation can quickly become active.*** [2]

#### 1.5 Self-Harm

Deliberate self-harm (DSH) — e.g., cutting, burning, overdose — frequently accompanies depression but must be distinguished from suicidal behaviour:
- Self-harm may serve as emotional regulation (the pain provides temporary relief from emotional numbness/anhedonia)
- However, DSH is itself a strong risk factor for completed suicide — every episode must be taken seriously
- ***In some younger people, the first obvious sign may be self-injury or bulimia or drug use in a previously stable adolescent*** [1]

<Callout title="Every Depressed Patient Needs a Suicide Risk Assessment" type="error">
This is non-negotiable. You MUST assess suicide risk in every depressed patient at every encounter. Ask directly — asking about suicide does NOT increase risk (this is a common misconception). Use the mnemonic: **Ideation → Plan → Intent → Means → Protective factors → Previous attempts**.
</Callout>

### 2. Non-Suicidal Mortality and Medical Complications

***Depression increases non-suicidal mortality:*** [1]
- ***Reviewed 61 reports; 72% demonstrated positive association for depression and non-suicide mortality***
- ***RR = 1.2–4.0***

***Depression is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.*** [1]

***Possible mediators:*** [1]
- ***Behavioural risk factors (e.g. poor adherence to treatment, inactivity, ↑ alcohol consumption)***
- ***Biological risk factors (e.g. altered thrombogenesis)***
- ***Subclinical disease / prevalent disease (e.g. cardiovascular disease)***

#### 2.1 Cardiovascular Disease

| Mechanism | Pathway | Clinical Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **HPA axis dysregulation** | Chronic ↑ cortisol → ↑ visceral fat, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, hypertension | Metabolic syndrome → accelerated atherosclerosis |
| **Altered thrombogenesis** | ↓ Serotonin in platelets (serotonin is stored in platelets and released during clot formation); altered platelet reactivity | ↑ Risk of thrombotic events (MI, stroke) |
| **Sympathetic overactivation** | ↑ NE, ↓ heart rate variability | ↑ Risk of arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death |
| **Inflammation** | ↑ Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP) | Endothelial dysfunction → atherosclerosis |
| **Behavioural** | Physical inactivity, poor diet, smoking, medication non-adherence | Multiple cardiovascular risk factors |

Depression is an **independent risk factor** for MI, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality. Post-MI depression worsens prognosis — hence why cardiac rehabilitation programmes now screen for depression.

#### 2.2 Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes

- Chronic cortisol → insulin resistance → type 2 diabetes
- Atypical depression with hyperphagia → weight gain → metabolic syndrome
- Antidepressant side effects (especially mirtazapine, TCAs, some antipsychotics used as augmentation) → weight gain, dyslipidaemia
- Depression impairs self-management of existing diabetes (poor adherence to diet, medications, glucose monitoring)

#### 2.3 Immune Dysfunction

- Depression is associated with ↑ pro-inflammatory cytokines and ↓ cellular immunity (↓ NK cell activity, ↓ T-cell function)
- This may partly explain the association with:
  - ↑ Susceptibility to infections
  - Poorer cancer prognosis (though evidence is mixed)
  - Accelerated ageing at the cellular level (telomere shortening)

#### 2.4 Chronic Pain

- Depression and chronic pain share common neurotransmitter pathways (↓ 5-HT and NE in descending pain-modulating pathways → lowered pain threshold)
- This creates a vicious cycle: pain → depression → ↓ pain threshold → more pain → worse depression
- This is why SNRIs (duloxetine) and TCAs (amitriptyline) are used for both depression and chronic pain

---

### 3. Psychiatric Comorbidity

***↑ co-morbidity with other disorders, especially anxiety and substance abuse*** [2]

#### 3.1 Anxiety Disorders

- **Prevalence**: Up to 70% of depressed patients have comorbid anxiety [2]
- **Why**: Shared neurobiology (↓ 5-HT, HPA axis dysregulation, amygdala hyperactivation), shared genetic risk factors, and shared environmental risk factors (early adversity, neuroticism)
- **Impact**: Comorbid anxiety worsens depression prognosis — ↑ severity, ↓ treatment response, ↑ chronicity, ↑ suicidal risk
- **Examples**: GAD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, OCD, PTSD

#### 3.2 Substance Use Disorders

- ***Depression: most common comorbidity [with alcoholism]; alcoholism may be a way of self-medication*** [2]
- Depression → substance use (self-medication: alcohol to numb emotional pain, cannabis for temporary mood lift, stimulants for energy)
- Substance use → depression (alcohol is a CNS depressant; stimulant withdrawal causes DA depletion → "crash")
- Both share genetic vulnerability
- Comorbid substance use is a major risk factor for suicide, treatment non-adherence, and poor functional outcomes

***Comorbid substance abuse is a prognosticant for relapse.*** [2]

***The distress caused by untreated mood symptoms results in increased suicidality, comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders.*** [3]

#### 3.3 Development of Bipolar Disorder

- ***~25% of bipolar affective disorder first presents as juvenile depression*** [2]
- Some patients initially diagnosed with MDD will later develop a manic/hypomanic episode, reclassifying them as bipolar disorder
- Predictors of bipolar conversion: early onset ( < 25y), psychotic features, family history of bipolar, atypical features (hypersomnia, hyperphagia), antidepressant-induced hypomania/mania

---

### 4. Functional Impairment and Disability

***Depression is the 4th leading cause of disability worldwide*** [2]
***Depressive disorder is the 1st cause of disability-adjusted life years under mental, neurological, and substance use disorders*** [3]
***~$85 billion/year loss of productivity*** [2]

| Domain | Impact | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Occupational** | Absenteeism (missing work), presenteeism (at work but unproductive), unemployment, disability claims | Anergia, poor concentration, psychomotor retardation, anhedonia → cannot perform job tasks |
| **Social** | Social withdrawal, relationship breakdown, isolation | Anhedonia → loss of interest in relationships; irritability → conflict; guilt/worthlessness → feels like a burden |
| **Self-care** | Poor hygiene, malnutrition, medical non-adherence | Anergia + anhedonia → cannot motivate to maintain basic activities of daily living |
| **Academic** | ***Decline in school performance*** [1] | Poor concentration (↓ dlPFC), fatigue, absenteeism |

***Only ~25% of those with recurrent major depression achieve 5-year clinical stability with good social and occupational performances.*** [2]

> This is a sobering statistic: 3 out of 4 patients with recurrent depression will NOT achieve full functional recovery. This underscores why aggressive treatment, relapse prevention, and rehabilitation are essential.

---

### 5. Cognitive Impairment

#### 5.1 Acute Cognitive Deficits During Episodes

- ***↓ activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex → psychomotor retardation, apathy, deficits in attention/working memory*** [2]
- Impaired executive function, processing speed, verbal memory
- In elderly: ***pseudodementia*** — cognitive impairment that mimics dementia but is reversible with treatment of depression

#### 5.2 Residual Cognitive Deficits Between Episodes

- Increasingly recognised that cognitive impairment persists even after mood symptoms remit
- Affects concentration, memory, decision-making → ongoing functional impairment
- ***~50% does not have complete symptom remission between episodes*** [2] — residual cognitive symptoms are among the most persistent

#### 5.3 Neuroprogression and Dementia Risk

This is a critical emerging concept:

***Neuroprogression theory: worse prognosis with frequent relapses. Increased risk of future development of dementia.*** [3]

- Each depressive episode causes cumulative neurobiological damage:
  - Chronic cortisol → hippocampal atrophy → memory impairment
  - ↓ BDNF → impaired neuroplasticity and neurogenesis
  - Chronic neuroinflammation → neuronal damage
- Meta-analyses show depression approximately **doubles the risk** of developing dementia (both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia)
- ***Progressive shortening of interval between episodes*** [2] — suggests a "kindling" effect where each episode lowers the threshold for the next one
- This provides a strong rationale for **maintenance treatment** and **relapse prevention** — you're not just preventing mood episodes, you're protecting the brain from cumulative damage

<Callout title="Depression as a Neurodegenerative Process">
Each untreated or inadequately treated depressive episode may cause cumulative hippocampal atrophy and neuroplastic damage (via chronic cortisol, ↓ BDNF, neuroinflammation). This "neuroprogression" means that depression is not a benign, self-limiting condition — recurrent episodes worsen long-term cognitive outcomes and increase dementia risk. This is one of the strongest arguments for aggressive relapse prevention with maintenance antidepressant therapy.

### 6. Impact on Physical Health and Medical Comorbidities

***Depression entails a non-psychiatric impact:*** [2]
- ***↑ morbidity: associated with ↓ birth weight, chronic medical illness, poor self-perceived health, functional/cognitive impairment***
- ***↑ mortality: RR 1.2–4.0× non-suicide mortality***

| Medical Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Worsened outcomes in chronic disease** | Depression impairs treatment adherence, self-care, and health behaviours (diet, exercise, smoking cessation) in patients with diabetes, CHF, COPD, CKD |
| **↓ Birth weight** | Maternal depression → ↑ cortisol crosses placenta → fetal growth restriction; also poor maternal nutrition and prenatal care |
| **Post-operative complications** | Depression → ↓ immune function, poor wound healing, medication non-adherence, longer hospital stays |
| **Osteoporosis** | Chronic ↑ cortisol → bone resorption; physical inactivity; poor nutrition |

---

### 7. Treatment-Related Complications

#### 7.1 Antidepressant Side Effects

| Side Effect | Drug Class | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Suicidal ideation (early treatment) | SSRIs (esp. in young adults) | Energy returns before mood → dangerous window | Black box warning; close monitoring in first 2 weeks |
| Serotonin syndrome | SSRIs + MAOIs / tramadol / triptans | Excessive synaptic 5-HT → autonomic instability, neuromuscular excitation, altered mental status | Medical emergency — can be fatal |
| QTc prolongation / arrhythmias | TCAs, citalopram (high dose) | Na⁺/K⁺ channel blockade | Lethal in overdose (TCAs); ECG monitoring |
| Hyponatraemia (SIADH) | SSRIs (esp. in elderly) | ↑ ADH secretion → water retention → dilutional hyponatraemia | Monitor Na⁺; can cause confusion, seizures |
| Discontinuation syndrome | Venlafaxine (short t½), paroxetine | Abrupt withdrawal → rebound monoamine changes | "Brain zaps," dizziness, irritability, insomnia; taper gradually |
| Metabolic syndrome | Mirtazapine, TCAs, atypical antipsychotics (augmentation) | H₁ blockade → weight gain; insulin resistance | Monitor weight, glucose, lipids |
| Tyramine crisis | Irreversible MAOIs | MAO-A inhibition in gut → tyramine absorption → massive NE release → hypertensive crisis | Dietary restrictions essential |

#### 7.2 ECT Complications

- ***Cognitive impairment: acute confusion, anterograde or retrograde amnesia — generally short-lived*** [2]
- ***Mortality: 2–4/100,000*** [2]

#### 7.3 Chronic Illness Behaviour

- With chronic or recurrent depression, patients may develop secondary behavioural patterns:
  - Learned helplessness → passivity and dependence on others
  - Sick role adoption → disability claims, avoidance of recovery
  - Caregiver burnout → relationship breakdown
  - ***Comorbid personality disorder is a prognosticant for relapse*** [2]

---

### 8. Social and Economic Complications

| Domain | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Relationships** | Marital breakdown, family conflict, social isolation | Irritability, withdrawal, emotional unavailability, burden on caregivers |
| **Parenting** | Impaired parenting → adverse outcomes for children | Depressed parents less responsive, less consistent; children of depressed parents have ↑ risk of developing depression themselves (genetic + environmental) |
| **Employment** | Job loss, reduced income, disability | Absenteeism, presenteeism, impaired performance |
| **Legal** | Self-neglect, capacity issues in severe depression | Psychotic depression may impair capacity to make decisions |
| **Economic** | ***~$85B/y loss of productivity*** [2]; healthcare utilisation | Direct costs (treatment) + indirect costs (lost productivity, disability payments) |

---

### 9. Chronic and Recurrent Course as a Complication

***Clinical course: generally self-limiting within 6 months to 1 year*** [2] — but:

- ***~80% will recur; average ~4 further episodes in 25 years*** [2]
- ***~25% > 1 year duration; ~10–20% chronic unremitting*** [2]
- ***~50% does not have complete symptom remission between episodes*** [2]
- ***Usually associated with progressive shortening of interval between episodes*** [2]

This chronic relapsing course is itself a major complication — each episode carries risk of:
- Further neurobiological damage (neuroprogression)
- Cumulative functional decline
- Suicide
- Substance abuse
- Caregiver and family burnout

***Prognosticants for relapse:*** [2]
1. ***Incomplete symptomatic remission***
2. ***Early age of onset***
3. ***Poor social support***
4. ***Poor physical health***
5. ***Comorbid substance abuse***
6. ***Comorbid personality disorder***

***In some tragic cases, symptoms may be masked to others until the person is found dead by suicide.*** [1]

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Suicide**: Most feared complication. 20× increased risk; 6% lifetime suicide mortality in affective disorders. In HK, MDD accounted for 27% of population-attributable suicide risk in adults and was the commonest psychiatric diagnosis among elderly suicide decedents. Hopelessness is the strongest predictor. Always assess: ideation → plan → intent → means → protective factors.

**Non-suicide mortality**: RR 1.2–4.0×, primarily through CVD (altered thrombogenesis, HPA axis dysregulation, inflammation, behavioural risk factors). Depression is an independent risk factor for MI and stroke.

**Psychiatric comorbidity**: 70% comorbid anxiety; frequent substance abuse (self-medication); 25% of youth depression converts to bipolar.

**Cognitive impairment and neuroprogression**: Each episode causes cumulative hippocampal atrophy and neuroplastic damage. Depression approximately doubles dementia risk. Residual cognitive deficits persist between episodes in ~50% of patients.

**Functional impairment**: 4th leading cause of disability worldwide. Only 25% of recurrent MDD patients achieve 5-year functional stability. Massive economic burden (~$85B/year).

**Chronic relapsing course**: 80% recurrence; average 4 episodes in 25 years; progressive interval shortening (kindling); 10–20% chronic unremitting. Poor prognosticants: incomplete remission, early onset, poor social support, poor physical health, comorbid SA, comorbid personality disorder.

**Treatment complications**: Early SSRI-induced suicidality (energy before mood); serotonin syndrome; TCA overdose lethality; SIADH; discontinuation syndrome; metabolic effects from augmentation agents.

SSRIs stimulate ADH release leading to water retention and dilutional hyponatraemia. Management: hold or switch the SSRI, fluid restriction (first-line), monitor sodium closely. Correct hyponatraemia gradually (no more than 10 mmol/L per 24 hours to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome). Consider switching to an antidepressant with lower SIADH risk (e.g. bupropion, mirtazapine)."
