## Complications of Dementia

Dementia is not merely a cognitive disorder — it is a progressive, systemic illness that generates a cascade of complications affecting virtually every organ system, the patient's safety, their psychiatric wellbeing, their family, and society. Understanding these complications from first principles means tracing each one back to the specific cognitive, motor, or behavioural deficit that causes it.

The complications can be organised into: **(1) Direct neuropsychiatric complications**, **(2) Medical/physical complications**, **(3) Functional decline and safety hazards**, **(4) Iatrogenic complications**, **(5) Caregiver and social complications**, and **(6) End-of-life complications**.

### 1. Neuropsychiatric Complications — BPSD

***Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)*** are themselves a major complication of the disease process, occurring in ***over 80% of dementia patients*** [16] and escalating with disease severity [2].

***BPSD includes*** [21][16]:
- ***Observed behaviours: screaming, restlessness, wandering, aggression, agitation, culturally inappropriate behaviour*** [21]
- ***Elicited psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, hallucination, delusion*** [21]

| BPSD Category | Specific Complications | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Depression*** | Major depression in 10%; depressive symptoms in > 50% of AD [2]. Leads to appetite loss, weight loss, social withdrawal, refusal of care, increased mortality. | Degeneration of serotonergic (raphe nuclei) and noradrenergic (locus coeruleus) pathways + reactive grief to perceived losses + social isolation. |
| ***Psychosis*** | ***Delusions 60%; hallucinations 20%*** [16]. Persecutory delusions (theft, infidelity, "phantom boarder") → agitation, aggression, refusal to eat (fears poisoning), relationship breakdown with carers. | Cholinergic depletion disrupts reality monitoring. Temporal-parietal degeneration → misidentification syndromes. In DLB, visual cortex Lewy body pathology → vivid visual hallucinations. |
| ***Agitation and aggression*** | ***Aggression 13%*** [16]. Physical harm to patient and carers. Major driver of institutionalisation and emergency department presentations. | Loss of frontal inhibitory control over limbic system (amygdala). Often precipitated by unrecognised pain, infection, or environmental over-stimulation in a patient who cannot articulate distress. |
| ***Wandering*** | Getting lost, exposure to weather, traffic accidents, elopement from care facilities. A significant cause of death in community-dwelling dementia patients. | Hippocampal and parietal degeneration → spatial disorientation + executive dysfunction → inability to plan a route or recognise being lost. Restlessness from frontal pathology drives purposeless ambulation. |
| ***Sundowning*** | ***↑motor activity in evening*** [2] — worsening confusion, agitation, and behavioural disturbance in the late afternoon/evening. | Degeneration of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN, the master circadian clock) → disrupted circadian rhythm. Compounded by evening fatigue, reduced ambient light (fewer environmental cues for orientation), and accumulated sensory overload throughout the day. |
| ***Sleep disturbance*** | ***Insomnia, disrupted sleep, phase delay in diurnal rhythm, parasomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness*** [2]. Fragmented sleep worsens cognition and increases fall risk. Also severely disrupts caregiver sleep. | SCN degeneration + cholinergic/orexinergic system disruption. In DLB, REM sleep behaviour disorder from brainstem pathology causes dream enactment with potential for self-injury or partner injury. |
| ***Sexual dysfunction*** | ***Disinhibition or ↓libido*** [2]. Sexual disinhibition → inappropriate touching, public exposure → distressing for family, potential legal/safeguarding consequences. | Orbitofrontal cortex damage → loss of social behavioural inhibition. Medial temporal/hypothalamic involvement may also affect libido regulation. |

<Callout title="BPSD — The Most Distressing Complication">
***BPSD is often more distressing than cognitive symptoms*** [2] — primarily to caregivers. It is the leading driver of **institutionalisation**, **caregiver burnout**, and **emergency presentations**. Always ask about BPSD systematically in every dementia review. The precipitant is often a treatable medical problem (UTI, pain, constipation).

### 2. Medical and Physical Complications

As dementia progresses, patients lose the ability to perform activities of daily living, maintain their own health, and protect themselves from harm. Each complication can be traced to a specific deficit:

#### A. Falls and Fractures

| Aspect | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Prevalence** | Dementia patients have 2–3× the fall rate of cognitively intact elderly. Falls are the commonest cause of injury-related death in dementia. |
| **Why?** | (1) **Visuospatial dysfunction** → misjudge distances, miss steps, trip over obstacles. (2) **Executive dysfunction** → cannot plan safe movement, poor judgement about capabilities. (3) **Gait apraxia** → especially in VaD and NPH. (4) **Parkinsonism** → in DLB/PDD, impaired postural reflexes and rigidity. (5) **Medications** → sedating drugs (BDZs, antipsychotics) ↑fall risk. (6) **Orthostatic hypotension** → autonomic dysfunction in DLB, or drug-induced (antipsychotics, AChEIs). |
| **Consequence** | Hip fractures are devastating — 30-day mortality ~10%; 1-year mortality ~30% in elderly with dementia. Immobilisation from fracture → rapid functional decline, pressure ulcers, pneumonia, DVT/PE. |
| **Prevention** | Home safety assessment (OT), remove rugs and obstacles, grab rails, adequate lighting, review medications, exercise programmes for balance, vitamin D supplementation, treat osteoporosis. |

#### B. Aspiration Pneumonia

| Aspect | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Why?** | Progressive involvement of cortical and brainstem swallowing centres → **swallowing apraxia/dysphagia**. Patients forget to chew properly, pocket food in cheeks, have impaired cough reflex, and lose the coordinated sequence of swallowing. Reduced consciousness/attention → food/liquid enters airway. |
| **Significance** | **The most common cause of death in advanced dementia.** Aspiration of oral/gastric contents → chemical and bacterial pneumonitis → sepsis. |
| **Clinical context** | In severe AD: ***bedbound, no speech, incontinent, basic psychomotor skills lost*** [2] → swallowing is one of the last motor functions to deteriorate, but when it does, the prognosis is very poor. |
| **Management** | Speech therapy assessment, modified diet textures, upright positioning during feeding, careful hand-feeding (often preferred over PEG tube in advanced dementia — PEG does NOT reduce aspiration risk and raises ethical concerns). Advance care planning is critical at this stage. |

#### C. Infections

| Infection | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **Urinary tract infections** | Incontinence → catheterisation → catheter-associated UTI. Also poor hygiene from functional decline. UTIs are the most common cause of **delirium superimposed on dementia** — an acute worsening that is treatable. |
| **Pneumonia** (non-aspiration) | Immobility → reduced lung expansion → atelectasis → pneumonia. Malnutrition → immunosuppression. |
| **Skin and soft tissue infections** | Pressure ulcers (from immobility) → secondary infection → cellulitis/sepsis. |

#### D. Malnutrition and Dehydration

| Aspect | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Why?** | (1) **Forgetting to eat** (memory loss). (2) **Apraxia of eating** (can't coordinate utensil use → spoon to mouth). (3) **Agnosia for food** (doesn't recognise food as food). (4) **Anorexia** from depression or medications (AChEI side effects → GI upset/anorexia). (5) **Hyperorality with non-food items** in FTD (paradoxically — they eat, but eat the wrong things). (6) **Dysphagia** in late stages. (7) **Dehydration** from forgetting to drink + unable to express thirst. |
| **Consequence** | Weight loss, sarcopenia (muscle wasting → further ↑fall risk), micronutrient deficiencies, impaired wound healing, immunosuppression, electrolyte imbalance, renal impairment, constipation (which itself precipitates BPSD and delirium). |

#### E. Pressure Ulcers

- **Why?** Advanced dementia → immobility (***bedbound*** [2]) → sustained pressure on bony prominences (sacrum, heels, greater trochanter) → tissue ischaemia → ulceration.
- **Compounded by:** malnutrition (impaired healing), incontinence (skin maceration), inability to communicate pain (so the patient cannot tell you they're uncomfortable).

#### F. Venous Thromboembolism (DVT/PE)

- **Why?** Immobility (Virchow's triad — stasis) + dehydration (haemoconcentration). Dementia patients cannot mobilise themselves and may not complain of leg swelling or dyspnoea.

#### G. Urinary and Faecal Incontinence

- **Why?** (1) Frontal lobe damage → loss of social inhibition of micturition/defaecation (patient doesn't recognise the need to go to a toilet). (2) Visuospatial dysfunction → can't find the toilet. (3) Apraxia → can't manage clothing/toilet mechanics. (4) Late-stage autonomic dysfunction → true neurogenic bladder/bowel.
- **Consequence:** Skin breakdown, UTIs, social embarrassment (contributes to caregiver burden and institutionalisation), significant cost of continence products/care.

#### H. Seizures

- ***Seizures: occur in 10–20%, usually in later stages*** of AD [2].
- **Why?** Widespread cortical neuronal loss → aberrant electrical networks. Aβ oligomers may also have direct pro-epileptogenic properties by disrupting synaptic inhibition (enhancing excitatory glutamatergic transmission relative to GABAergic inhibition).
- Seizures may present atypically in dementia — as unexplained episodes of confusion, staring, or falls — and can be mistaken for BPSD or disease progression.

---

### 3. Delirium Superimposed on Dementia

This deserves its own section because it is **the single most important acute complication** of dementia.

| Aspect | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Prevalence** | Dementia is the **strongest predisposing factor** for delirium. Up to 50% of hospitalised dementia patients develop delirium. Delirium incidence is ***5× higher in dementia patients*** [2]. |
| **Why?** | The dementia brain has reduced "cognitive reserve" — it is operating at the edge of its capacity. Any additional insult (infection, medication, metabolic derangement, pain, constipation) tips it over the threshold into delirium. Think of it as a system with no safety margin. |
| **Why it matters** | (1) Delirium itself carries **significant mortality** (14% at 1 month, 22% at 6 months [2]). (2) Delirium ***may accelerate the pace of cognitive decline*** [2] — each episode of delirium causes additional neuronal damage. (3) It signals an **underlying treatable medical problem** that must be found and addressed. |
| **Challenge** | Distinguishing delirium from worsening BPSD can be very difficult. The key is any **acute change from baseline** — particularly in level of consciousness, attention, and presence of new perceptual disturbance. If in doubt, assume delirium until proven otherwise. |
| **Common precipitants** | UTI (most common), pneumonia, constipation, pain (especially hip fracture), medication changes (especially anticholinergics, BDZs, opioids), dehydration, urinary retention, environmental change (e.g. hospitalisation). |

---

### 4. Iatrogenic Complications

Dementia patients are particularly vulnerable to complications from the very medications and interventions intended to help them:

| Complication | Cause | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Antipsychotic-related mortality** | SGAs and FGAs prescribed for BPSD | All antipsychotics carry a **1.6–1.7× increased mortality** risk in dementia patients (primarily from cerebrovascular events and infections). This is why the principle is ***lowest dose, shortest duration***. |
| **Antipsychotic sensitivity in DLB** | Typical antipsychotics (or even atypicals) in DLB | ***Antipsychotic sensitivity (30–50%) → acute irreversible Parkinsonism, LOC ± NMS*** [2]. Dopaminergic pathways already severely depleted by Lewy body pathology — blocking residual D2 receptors is catastrophic. |
| **AChEI side effects** | Donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine | GI upset (nausea, diarrhoea, anorexia/weight loss — worsening malnutrition), bradycardia/syncope (↑vagal tone → falls), sleep disturbance. |
| **Benzodiazepine harms** | BDZs prescribed for agitation/insomnia | ***↑fall risk, dependence*** [2], excessive sedation, paradoxical disinhibition, respiratory depression, worsened cognition. Slow metabolism in elderly → accumulation. |
| **Anticholinergic burden** | Multiple medications with anticholinergic properties | Cumulative anticholinergic effects from polypharmacy → worsened confusion, urinary retention, constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision. Common offenders: oxybutynin, TCAs, antihistamines, some antipsychotics. |
| **Polypharmacy** | Multiple comorbidities typical in elderly | Drug-drug interactions, increased adverse effects, reduced compliance, medication errors (patient cannot manage medications independently). |
| **Hospitalisation-related decompensation** | Admission for any medical reason | Unfamiliar environment → acute disorientation → delirium. Immobility → deconditioning. Hospital-acquired infections. Falls in unfamiliar setting. Often results in a "step-down" in functional status that is never recovered. |

---

### 5. Functional Decline — The Progressive Loss of Independence

The clinical staging from the lecture slides captures the trajectory of functional decline [2][15][22]:

| Stage | Functional Status | ADL Impact |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **MCI** | ***Complaints of memory loss, intact activities of daily living*** [2] | Fully independent |
| ***Mild AD*** | ***Forgetfulness, short memory loss, repetitive questions, hobbies/interests lost, impaired activities of daily living*** [2] | Loses complex ***I-ADLs***: ***finance, transportation, preparing meals, communication, shopping, medications*** [22] |
| ***Moderate AD*** | ***Progression of cognitive deficits, dysexecutive syndrome, further impaired ADLs, transitions in care, emergence of BPSD*** [2] | Needs help with basic ***B-ADLs***: ***eating, bathing, dressing, toileting*** [22] |
| ***Severe AD*** | ***Agitation, altered sleep patterns, assistance required in dressing, feeding, bathing, established BPSD*** [2] | Fully dependent for all ADLs |
| ***Very severe AD*** | ***Bedbound, no speech, incontinent, basic psychomotor skills lost*** [2] | Total care required; life-sustaining functions compromised |

> The mnemonic for ADLs [2]: **DEATH SHAFT** — B-ADL: **D**ressing, **E**ating, **A**mbulation, **T**oilet, **H**ygiene. I-ADL: **S**hopping, **H**ousekeeping, **A**ccounting, **F**ood preparation, **T**elephone/transportation.

Loss of I-ADLs first (they require more complex cognitive processing — planning, sequencing, judgement), then B-ADLs (which are more procedural/habitual and thus preserved longer). This follows the "retrogenesis" pattern — functional abilities are lost in the reverse order of childhood development.

---

### 6. Safety Hazards

| Hazard | Mechanism | Consequence |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Driving** | Visuospatial dysfunction + executive dysfunction + slowed reaction time + poor judgement | Motor vehicle accidents. Driving capacity should be assessed and licence revoked when unsafe. Many jurisdictions require mandatory reporting. |
| **Fire/cooking accidents** | Forgetting to turn off stove, leaving items on heat, inability to respond appropriately to fire alarm | Burns, house fires. Kitchen safety assessment and modifications essential (automatic stove shut-off, microwave instead of gas). |
| **Financial exploitation** | Loss of judgement + trust + inability to manage complex transactions | Vulnerability to scams, fraud, and exploitation by strangers or even family members. Power of attorney/guardianship should be arranged early. |
| **Medication errors** | Forgetting doses, double-dosing, taking wrong medication | Toxicity or therapeutic failure. Medication management systems (dosette boxes, blister packs, supervised dosing) are critical. |
| ***Elderly abuse*** [12] | Vulnerability from dependence + inability to report/recognise abuse | ***Be aware of ELDERLY ABUSE*** [12]. Can be physical, psychological, financial, sexual, or neglect. Clinicians must be vigilant — unexplained bruises, malnutrition, fearfulness, withdrawal of finances. |

---

### 7. Caregiver Complications — The "Hidden Patients"

***Treat the "hidden patient(s)"*** [12] — this is one of the most important lecture slide points and deserves serious emphasis.

| Caregiver Complication | Details | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Depression** | 30–50% of dementia caregivers develop clinical depression | Chronic stress, grief (anticipatory and ongoing — "ambiguous loss" as the person they knew fades), sleep deprivation, social isolation, physical exhaustion |
| **Anxiety** | High prevalence | Constant worry about patient safety, wandering, unpredictable BPSD, financial burden, future planning |
| **Physical health decline** | ↑cardiovascular disease, ↑immune dysfunction, ↑mortality | Chronic cortisol elevation (HPA axis dysregulation from sustained stress), neglect of own health (missed appointments, poor diet, reduced exercise) |
| **Social isolation** | Progressive withdrawal from social life | Cannot leave patient alone; embarrassment about patient's behaviour in public; friends/family withdraw |
| **Financial burden** | Cost of care escalates as disease progresses | Loss of income (caregiver may quit work), cost of medications, home modifications, day care, residential care. In Hong Kong, residential care costs can exceed HK$10,000–30,000+/month. |
| ***Caregiver stress → institutionalisation*** [16] | BPSD (especially aggression, night-time disturbance, incontinence, wandering) is the primary driver | When caregiver capacity is exceeded, residential/nursing home placement becomes necessary |
| **Burnout** | Complete physical and emotional exhaustion | When demands chronically exceed resources with inadequate support |

---

### 8. End-of-Life Complications

In the terminal stages of dementia, the patient faces complications that are often the proximate cause of death:

| Complication | Mechanism | Management Considerations |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Aspiration pneumonia** | Swallowing apraxia → most common cause of death in advanced dementia | Goals-of-care discussion: treat with antibiotics? Comfort measures only? Advance directive critical. |
| **Cachexia** | Progressive inability to eat → severe malnutrition → muscle wasting → organ failure | PEG feeding is controversial in advanced dementia — does NOT improve survival, comfort, or reduce aspiration. Hand-feeding with comfort-focused approach is generally preferred. |
| **Immobility-related complications** | Pressure ulcers, DVT/PE, contractures, pneumonia | Palliative care approach: positioning, skin care, pain management |
| **Loss of communication** | Complete aphasia/mutism in end-stage | Cannot express pain, hunger, thirst → increased suffering if not proactively assessed. Non-verbal pain assessment tools (e.g. PAINAD scale) are essential. |
| **Ethical dilemmas** | Capacity loss → decisions about resuscitation, hospitalisation, feeding, treatment of intercurrent illness | Advance care planning should ideally occur early in the disease when the patient still has capacity. Without advance directives, best-interests decisions under MHO Part IVC [2]. |

---

### 9. Prognosis by Dementia Subtype

| Subtype | Median Survival | Key Prognostic Features |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **AD** | ***5–7 years (senior notes); 8–10 years (lecture slides)*** [2][15] | Survival associated with older age of onset and rapid cognitive decline [2]. Death usually from aspiration pneumonia or intercurrent infection. |
| **VaD** | ***~5 years; ~50% dying from IHD*** [2] | Stepwise decline; each vascular event risks significant step-down. Cardiovascular disease is both the cause and the killer. |
| **DLB** | ***Average lifespan 7.7 years*** [2] | Gradual deterioration [2]. Antipsychotic sensitivity can precipitate rapid decline. |
| **FTD** | ***Average survival 8–10 years (shorter for bvFTD)*** [2] | ***Progresses faster than AD*** [2]. FTD-MND overlap has very poor prognosis (2–3 years). |
| **CJD** | Months (sporadic); ~14 months (variant) | Rapidly fatal; no effective treatment |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of Dementia">

**BPSD** (> 80% prevalence): Depression, psychosis (delusions 60%, hallucinations 20%), agitation/aggression, wandering, sundowning, sleep disturbance, sexual dysfunction. Often more distressing than cognitive symptoms. Leading cause of caregiver stress and institutionalisation.

**Falls** (2–3× rate): Due to visuospatial dysfunction, gait apraxia, Parkinsonism (DLB), medications, orthostatic hypotension. Hip fracture mortality ~30% at 1 year.

**Aspiration pneumonia**: Most common cause of death in advanced dementia. Due to swallowing apraxia/dysphagia. PEG tube does NOT reduce aspiration risk.

**Delirium superimposed on dementia**: 5× incidence. Dementia is the strongest predisposing factor. Usually precipitated by UTI, pneumonia, pain, constipation, medication. Accelerates cognitive decline. Always assume delirium if acute change from baseline.

**Iatrogenic**: Antipsychotics → 1.6× mortality, stroke risk, irreversible Parkinsonism in DLB. BDZs → falls, sedation. Anticholinergic burden → worsened cognition. Hospitalisation → decompensation.

**Functional decline**: I-ADLs lost first (finance, medications, cooking), then B-ADLs (dressing, eating, toileting). End-stage: bedbound, no speech, incontinent.

**Safety**: Driving accidents, fires, financial exploitation, medication errors, ELDERLY ABUSE.

**Caregivers** ("hidden patients"): 30–50% develop depression. Social isolation, financial burden, physical health decline. Caregiver stress is the primary driver of institutionalisation.

**Prognosis**: AD 5–10y, VaD ~5y (50% die of IHD), DLB ~7.7y, FTD 8–10y, CJD months.
