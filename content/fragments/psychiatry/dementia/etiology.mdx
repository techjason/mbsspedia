## 1. Definition

Dementia is ***a syndrome due to disease of the brain, usually of a chronic or progressive nature, in which there is disturbance of multiple higher cortical functions*** [1][2]. Let's break this definition down from the ICD-10 piece by piece, because every word matters clinically:

- **"Syndrome"** — not a single disease, but a clinical constellation of symptoms and signs arising from many possible aetiologies. You must always look for the *cause*.
- **"Due to disease of the brain"** — distinguishes it from functional psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression causing pseudodementia).
- **"Usually chronic or progressive"** — this separates it from **delirium** (acute, fluctuating consciousness) and other acute neurological insults. However, some dementias (e.g. CJD) can be rapidly progressive.
- **"Disturbance of multiple higher cortical functions"** — typically affecting ≥2 cognitive domains (memory, executive function, language, visuospatial, social cognition, complex attention). The DSM-5 requires decline in ≥1 domain, but classically ≥2 are involved.
- **"Without impairment of consciousness"** — a critical distinction from delirium. If consciousness is clouded, you cannot diagnose dementia at that moment (though the two can co-exist).

### DSM-5 Terminology: Major Neurocognitive Disorder

The DSM-5 (2013, updated DSM-5-TR 2022) replaced "dementia" with **Major Neurocognitive Disorder (Major NCD)**, though "dementia" remains acceptable as a descriptor, especially for degenerative conditions. The key DSM-5 criteria are [2]:

| DSM-5 Criterion | Explanation |
|:---|:---|
| **A.** Evidence of significant cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in **≥1 cognitive domain** (complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, social cognition) | Based on (1) concern of patient/informant/clinician AND (2) substantial impairment on standardised neuropsychological testing (typically ≥2 SD below mean) |
| **B.** The cognitive deficits **interfere with independence** in everyday activities | At minimum, requires assistance with complex instrumental ADLs (e.g. managing finances, medications) |
| **C.** Not occurring exclusively in the context of **delirium** | Must rule out acute confusional state |
| **D.** Not better explained by another **mental disorder** (e.g. major depression, schizophrenia) | Pseudodementia must be excluded |

The distinction between **Major NCD** (dementia) and **Mild NCD** (mild cognitive impairment, MCI) is functional: in Mild NCD, cognitive decline is present but independence in daily activities is preserved (perhaps with greater effort or compensatory strategies).

<Callout title="Dementia vs Delirium vs Depression — The 3 D's" type="error">
A classic exam trap. Delirium has **acute onset, fluctuating consciousness, and inattention**. Depression can cause "pseudodementia" with poor concentration and apparent memory loss but the patient typically *complains* about memory (unlike true dementia where insight is often lost). All three can co-exist, especially in the elderly. Always rule out delirium before diagnosing dementia.
</Callout>

## 2. Epidemiology

### Global Burden
- ***Over 30 million people have dementia worldwide*** [3]. Current estimates (2024–2025) place this closer to 55 million globally, projected to reach ~139 million by 2050 due to population ageing.
- Dementia is a leading cause of disability and dependency among older adults worldwide.

### Hong Kong Specific
- ***9.1% dementia prevalence rate in Hong Kong*** (aged > 65) [3][2].
- ***"Milder" cognitive impairment ranges from 3 to 23%*** [3].
- ***Huge burdens to societies by 2050*** [3] — Hong Kong's rapidly ageing population means the absolute number of dementia cases will rise dramatically. By some projections, HK's dementia population could triple by 2050.

### Age-Specific Prevalence
- ***Prevalence increases with age: 10% at 65; 25% at 85*** [3][4].
- Prevalence roughly **doubles every 5 years** after age 65 [2].
- ***6 to 10% over 65 year-old in North America*** [3].

### Age of Onset Classification [2]
- **Presenile (Early onset):** < 65 years — more commonly FTD, CJD; more often genetically implicated; more rapid progression.
- **Senile (Late onset):** ≥ 65 years — AD remains most common in both groups, but DLB and VaD are more common in late-onset.

### Sex Distribution
- Overall, females are at slightly higher risk (especially for AD — partly because women live longer, and oestrogen loss post-menopause may play a role).
- DLB has a male predominance (M:F = 4:1) [2].

## 3. Risk Factors

Understanding risk factors is essential because some are **modifiable** — and modification is currently our best strategy for prevention (the Lancet Commission 2020/2024 identifies 14 modifiable risk factors accounting for ~45% of dementia cases).

### Non-Modifiable Risk Factors

| Factor | Explanation |
|:---|:---|
| **Age** | Single strongest risk factor. Incidence doubles every 5 years after 65. |
| ***Family history*** [4] | 10–30% increased risk; up to 30% of AD cases are familial [2]. First-degree relative with dementia roughly doubles your risk. |
| ***Genetics*** [4] | **Early-onset AD:** autosomal dominant mutations in *APP* (Ch21), *PSEN1* (Ch14, >70% of familial early-onset AD), *PSEN2* (Ch1). **Late-onset AD:** *APOE* ε4 allele (heterozygous: 3× risk; homozygous: 12× risk; accounts for ~50% of vulnerability to late-onset AD) [2]. |
| ***Female sex*** [4] | Especially for AD. |
| **Down syndrome (Trisomy 21)** | APP gene is on chromosome 21 → extra copy → lifelong overproduction of Aβ → virtually all individuals with Down syndrome develop AD pathology by age 40. |

### Modifiable Risk Factors (Lancet Commission 2024)

| Factor | Mechanism / Explanation |
|:---|:---|
| ***Low education*** [4] | Lower cognitive reserve → less capacity to compensate for neuropathology. Education builds synaptic density and neural networks ("cognitive reserve hypothesis"). |
| ***Cardiovascular dysfunction*** [4] — HTN, dyslipidaemia, IHD | Vascular risk factors damage cerebral vasculature → chronic hypoperfusion, white matter ischaemia, and promote amyloid deposition. ***HTN in midlife*** is particularly important. |
| **Diabetes mellitus (Type 2)** | Insulin resistance → impaired cerebral glucose metabolism + promotes neuroinflammation + accelerates amyloid pathology. |
| **Obesity (midlife)** | Adipokine-mediated neuroinflammation + vascular risk. |
| **Physical inactivity** | Exercise promotes BDNF, cerebral perfusion, and amyloid clearance via the glymphatic system. |
| ***Head trauma*** [4] | Traumatic brain injury (even single moderate-severe TBI) → diffuse axonal injury, tau pathology, chronic neuroinflammation (cf. chronic traumatic encephalopathy). |
| **Smoking** | Vascular damage + direct neurotoxicity + oxidative stress. |
| **Excessive alcohol** | Direct neurotoxicity (especially frontal lobe), thiamine deficiency → Wernicke-Korsakoff, and vascular damage [2]. |
| **Depression** | Chronic depression → hippocampal atrophy via sustained cortisol exposure (HPA axis dysregulation). Also reduces social/cognitive engagement. |
| **Social isolation** | Reduced cognitive stimulation → less cognitive reserve building. |
| **Hearing loss (midlife)** | Reduced auditory input → cognitive load shift + social withdrawal + accelerated temporal lobe atrophy. Now considered the single largest modifiable risk factor. |
| **Air pollution** | Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) → neuroinflammation + amyloid deposition. |
| **Untreated vision loss** | Similar to hearing loss — sensory deprivation reduces cognitive stimulation. |

<Callout title="High Yield — Modifiable Risk Factors">
The Lancet Commission (2024) estimates that addressing all 14 modifiable risk factors could prevent or delay up to **45%** of dementia cases. For exams, remember the big hitters: **hearing loss, low education, hypertension, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, excessive alcohol, TBI, air pollution, social isolation, and untreated vision loss**. In Hong Kong, vascular risk factors (HTN, DM, dyslipidaemia) are especially prevalent and important.

## 4. Anatomy and Function — The Cognitive Domains

To understand dementia, you need to understand *what* is being damaged. The DSM-5 defines **6 cognitive domains**, each mapped to specific brain regions. Dementia is essentially the progressive destruction of these networks.

### 4.1 The Six Cognitive Domains (DSM-5)

| Domain | Brain Region(s) | What It Does | How Decline Presents |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Complex Attention** | Prefrontal cortex, reticular activating system, right parietal | Sustained, divided, selective attention; processing speed | Easily distracted, can't follow conversations, loses track of tasks, slow processing |
| **Executive Function** | Prefrontal cortex (dorsolateral, orbitofrontal), anterior cingulate | Planning, decision-making, working memory, mental flexibility, error correction, inhibition | Poor judgement, can't manage finances, difficulty multitasking, rigid thinking, perseveration |
| **Learning and Memory** | Hippocampus (encoding), entorhinal cortex, medial temporal lobe, mammillary bodies, anterior thalamus (Papez circuit) | Encoding, storage, retrieval of new information (episodic, semantic, procedural) | Repeats questions, forgets recent events, needs reminders, eventually loses remote memories |
| **Language** | Left perisylvian cortex: Broca's area (expressive), Wernicke's area (receptive), arcuate fasciculus | Expressive and receptive language, naming, fluency, comprehension | Word-finding difficulty, circumlocution, paraphasias, eventually mutism |
| **Perceptual-Motor (Visuospatial)** | Parietal-occipital cortex (dorsal "where" stream), inferior temporal cortex (ventral "what" stream) | Spatial orientation, face recognition, object recognition, constructional ability | Gets lost in familiar places, can't park car, difficulty with copying drawings, prosopagnosia |
| ***Social Cognition*** [2] | Orbitofrontal cortex, anterior temporal lobe, amygdala, anterior cingulate | Emotion recognition, theory of mind, social appropriateness | Socially inappropriate behaviour, loss of empathy, insensitivity to social cues, disinhibition |

### 4.2 Key Neuroanatomical Structures

- **Hippocampus**: The gateway for new episodic memory encoding. This is why AD (which starts in the entorhinal cortex/hippocampus) presents first with **anterograde amnesia** — new memories cannot be laid down.
- **Entorhinal cortex**: The "relay station" between hippocampus and neocortex. First region affected in AD (Braak stage I-II).
- **Basal nucleus of Meynert**: Major source of cholinergic projections to the cortex. Its degeneration in AD leads to widespread ACh depletion → basis for cholinesterase inhibitor therapy [5].
- **Frontal lobes**: Executive function, personality, social conduct, motivation. Damage → disinhibition, apathy, poor planning (as in FTD).
- **Parietal lobes**: Visuospatial processing, praxis. Damage → apraxia, agnosia, spatial disorientation.
- **Temporal lobes**: Memory (medial), language (lateral dominant hemisphere), semantic knowledge (anterior). Damage → amnesia, aphasia.
- **Basal ganglia/thalamus/subcortical white matter**: Processing speed, procedural memory, attention. Damage → subcortical dementia pattern (slowness, forgetfulness improved by cueing, apathy).

### 4.3 Cortical vs Subcortical Dementia [2]

This classification is clinically useful for pattern recognition:

| Feature | Cortical Dementia | Subcortical Dementia |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Prototypes** | AD, FTD | VaD (subcortical type), PD-dementia, PSP, HD, CJD |
| **Memory** | True amnesia (encoding failure — can't register new information; prompting doesn't help) | "Forgetfulness" (retrieval failure — recognition > recall; improved by prompting/cueing) |
| **Language** | Aphasia (word-finding difficulty → fluent aphasia → global) | Preserved but with reduced verbal fluency |
| **Higher cortical functions** | Apraxia, agnosia, acalculia | Typically preserved |
| **Speed of thought** | Relatively preserved early | Slowed (bradyphrenia) |
| **Personality/mood** | Often preserved until late (AD) or early change (FTD) | Apathy, flat affect, depression early |
| **Motor signs** | Usually absent until late | Dysarthria, movement disorders early |

### 4.4 Anterior vs Posterior Dementia [2]

| Feature | Anterior Dementia (Frontal) | Posterior Dementia (Parietal-Temporal) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Key features** | Behavioural changes, disinhibition, antisocial behaviour, apathy | Memory loss, language disturbance with relatively preserved behaviour |
| **Prototypes** | FTD, NPH, Huntington's disease | Alzheimer's disease |

---

## 5. Aetiology

The causes of dementia can be broadly categorised into **degenerative (primary)** and **secondary** causes. This is critical because secondary causes may be **reversible** — missing them is a clinical catastrophe.

### 5.1 Overview of Aetiologies [1][2][3]

***The top three causes of dementia are: Alzheimer's Disease (most common), Vascular Dementia, and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)*** [3].

***Mixed dementia usually means AD mixed with vascular*** [3].

```
Mnemonic for reversible causes: "DEMENTIA"
D — Drugs/toxins (anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, alcohol)
E — Endocrine (hypothyroidism, Cushing's, Addison's)
M — Metabolic (B12, folate, renal failure, hepatic failure, Wilson's)
E — Emotional (depression → pseudodementia)
N — Normal pressure hydrocephalus
T — Tumour/mass lesion (frontal, corpus callosum, 3rd ventricle)
I — Infectious (HIV, neurosyphilis, CJD)
A — Autoimmune (cerebral vasculitis, SLE, autoimmune encephalitis)
```

### 5.2 Degenerative (Primary) Causes [1][2]

#### A. Pure Dementias

**i. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) — 50–70% of all dementia**

***AD accounts for about "50%–60%" of all dementia cases*** [4].

- ***Prevalence increases with age: 10% at 65; 25% at 85*** [4].
- ***Early onset ( < 65 y.o.), late onset (≥ 65 y.o.)*** [4].
- ***Duration of disease: diagnosis to death 8 to 10 years*** [4].
- ***Risk factors: genetics (PS1 and PS2, APP, ApoE), female, family history, head trauma, low education, cardiovascular dysfunction*** [4].

**Pathophysiology of AD** — understanding this is essential:

***AD pathology*** [5]:
- ***Deposition of beta amyloid peptides/amyloid plaque (extracellular) — amyloid cascade hypothesis*** [5]
- ***Formation of highly ordered aggregates of hyper-phosphorylated tau — Neurofibrillary Tangles, NFTs (intracellular)*** [5]
- ***AD pathology usually involves the temporal lobe at the beginning, affecting hippocampus → memory impairment*** [5]
- ***Cholinergic deficit:*** [5]
  - ***Loss of cholinergic biosynthetic machinery***
  - ***Loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons***
  - ***Cholinergic deficit contributes to the impairment of memory and attention***

**The Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis** [2][5][6]:

This is the most influential hypothesis. The timeline graphic from the lecture slides is key [6]:

***β-amyloid deposition begins decades before clinical symptoms (age ~30–40), followed by microglial activation, then neurofibrillary tangles, then neuronal loss/neurochemical changes, and finally clinical DEMENTIA (age ~70–90)*** [6].

Step-by-step:

1. **Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)** is a normal transmembrane protein (on chromosome 21). It is cleaved by **secretases**:
   - **Non-amyloidogenic pathway** (normal): α-secretase cleaves within the Aβ domain → no toxic amyloid formed.
   - **Amyloidogenic pathway** (pathological): β-secretase (BACE1) and then γ-secretase cleave APP → produces **Aβ peptides**, particularly the 42-amino acid variant (**Aβ42**), which is highly hydrophobic and prone to aggregation.

2. **In familial (early-onset) AD**: Mutations in APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 (the latter two are subunits/regulators of γ-secretase) → **increased Aβ42 production** throughout life [2].

3. **In sporadic (late-onset) AD**: Failure of Aβ **clearance** mechanisms (e.g. APOE4 is less efficient at clearing Aβ, neuroinflammation impairs microglial phagocytosis) → gradual accumulation [2].

4. **Consequence**: Aβ42 accumulates → forms **oligomers** (soluble, highly toxic) → then **fibrils** → then **plaques** (neuritic plaques = degenerated axons/synapses around amyloid core) in limbic and association cortices.

5. **Downstream effects**: Oligomeric Aβ → synaptic toxicity → **microglial/astrocytic activation → neuroinflammation** → altered ionic homeostasis → oxidative injury → **tau hyperphosphorylation** → neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) → **neuronal and synaptic loss** [2].

6. **Tau pathology** follows a stereotypical spread (Braak staging):
   - Stage I–II: Entorhinal cortex (transentorhinal)
   - Stage III–IV: Hippocampus, limbic structures
   - Stage V–VI: Neocortex (widespread) [2]

**Why Aβ42 specifically?** Because the 42-amino acid form is more hydrophobic than Aβ40 and thus more prone to aggregation and toxicity.

**The Cholinergic Hypothesis** [2][5]:
- Was the *prior prevailing view* but now considered incomplete.
- Observation: Degeneration of cholinergic neurons from the **basal nucleus of Meynert** → severe and widespread loss of **acetylcholine (ACh)**.
- ACh is critical for memory consolidation and attention — its loss accounts for core cognitive symptoms.
- **Clinical significance**: Led to development of **acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs)** — donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine — which remain first-line symptomatic treatment.

**Genetics of AD in detail** [2][4]:

| Gene | Chromosome | Protein | Mechanism | Onset |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ***APP*** | 21 | Amyloid Precursor Protein | Mutations alter cleavage → ↑Aβ42 | Early ( < 65) |
| ***PSEN1*** | 14 | Presenilin 1 (γ-secretase subunit) | ↑Aβ42 production; accounts for > 70% of familial early-onset AD | Early ( < 65) |
| ***PSEN2*** | 1 | Presenilin 2 (γ-secretase regulator) | ↑Aβ42 production; rarer | Early ( < 65) |
| ***APOE*** | 19 | Apolipoprotein E (ε4 allele) | Less efficient Aβ clearance; accounts for ~50% of late-onset AD vulnerability; less penetrant | Late (≥ 65) |

> Why does Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) lead to early AD? Because APP is on chromosome 21 — having 3 copies means lifelong overproduction of Aβ.

**ii. Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) — ~5%** [1][2]

- "Fronto" = frontal lobe; "temporal" = temporal lobe → the name tells you where the pathology is and therefore predicts the clinical features (behaviour/personality from frontal; language from temporal).
- Common cause of **early-onset dementia** (average onset 58 years, unusual before 40 or after 70).
- **Highly heritable** (~40% have FHx for dementia/psychiatric disease); ~10–25% autosomal dominant inheritance.
- Key genes: **C9ORF72** (most common genetic cause), **MAPT** (tau), **GRN** (progranulin).
- **Gross pathology**: Frontotemporal lobar atrophy → classically ***"knife-blade" atrophy*** (razor-thin gyri) [2].
- **Microscopic**: Microvacuolation, neuronal loss, swollen neurons. Half show **tau inclusions** (***Pick's bodies*** — round, silver-staining intracytoplasmic inclusions); others show **TDP-43** or **FUS** inclusions [2].

#### B. Dementia-Plus Syndromes [2]

These are neurodegenerative conditions where dementia is a prominent but not the sole feature — there are additional motor or other neurological features.

**i. Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) — ~10% (commonest degenerative dementia after AD)** [2]

- "Lewy" = Friedrich Lewy, who described the characteristic inclusions.
- Demographics: Average onset 75 years, M > F = 4:1 [2].
- **Pathology**: ***Lewy bodies*** — round, eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic neuronal inclusions composed of **phosphorylated alpha-synuclein** — found in deep cortical layers throughout the brain (especially anterior frontal/temporal, cingulate, insula) [2].
- Alpha-synuclein is a presynaptic protein involved in synaptic vesicle regulation. When it misfolds and aggregates → Lewy bodies → neuronal dysfunction and death.
- DLB, PD-dementia, and MSA are all **synucleinopathies** (united by alpha-synuclein pathology).
- Mostly sporadic; associated with *GBA* mutation (glucocerebrosidase — same gene as Gaucher's disease); familial forms associated with *SNCA* duplication/triplication [2].

**ii. Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD) — ~2%** [2]

- Same underlying pathology as DLB (Lewy body disease), but the **"1-year rule"** is used to distinguish:
  - PDD: Motor Parkinsonism present for **> 1 year** before dementia onset.
  - DLB: Dementia occurs **within 1 year of** or **before** motor Parkinsonism.
- Clinical features similar to DLB.

**iii. Other Dementia-Plus Syndromes**
- **Corticobasal degeneration (CBD)**: Asymmetric rigidity + apraxia + alien limb phenomenon + cortical sensory loss + dementia.
- **Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)**: Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy + axial rigidity + early falls + subcortical dementia.
- **Huntington's disease (HD)**: Autosomal dominant; CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in *HTT* gene (Ch4) → chorea + psychiatric symptoms + subcortical dementia.

### 5.3 Vascular Dementia (VaD) — 10–20% [1][2]

***Vascular Dementia*** is the ***second most common cause*** of dementia [3].

- "Vascular" = relating to blood vessels → brain damage from cerebrovascular disease.
- Onset typically in late 60s–70s.
- **Risk factors**: All ***vascular risk factors*** — HTN, prior stroke, IHD, peripheral vascular disease, DM, AF, smoking, dyslipidaemia [2].
- ***May be mixed with AD*** — this is extremely common and called **mixed dementia** [3].

**Pathophysiological mechanisms** [2]:

| Subtype | Mechanism | Location |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Large artery infarcts (post-stroke dementia)** | Single strategic infarct or multiple cortical infarcts | Usually cortical, but may be subcortical |
| **Small artery (lacunar) infarcts (multi-infarct dementia)** | Multiple small vessel occlusions → lacunes | Exclusively subcortical (basal ganglia, thalamus, internal capsule, cerebellum, brainstem) |
| **Chronic subcortical ischaemia (Binswanger's disease)** | Chronic hypoperfusion → periventricular white matter damage | White matter, without discrete stroke episodes |
| **CADASIL** | Autosomal dominant mutation in *NOTCH3* → vasculopathy in small cerebral vessels | Subcortical infarcts + leukoencephalopathy |
| **Haemorrhagic dementia** | Repeated cerebral haemorrhages (e.g. CAA) | Variable |
| **Hypoperfusion dementia** | Global cerebral hypoperfusion (e.g. cardiac arrest, severe hypotension) | Watershed zones |

### 5.4 Secondary (Potentially Reversible) Causes [1][2]

These are critical because they are **treatable**. Missing a reversible cause is unforgivable.

| Category | Examples | Why It Causes Dementia |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Endocrine/Metabolic*** | Hypothyroidism, renal failure, hepatic failure, hypercalcaemia, hyponatraemia | Metabolic encephalopathy → impaired neuronal function |
| ***Mass Lesions/Structural*** | NPH, frontal tumours, corpus callosum tumours, 3rd ventricle tumours | Direct compression/displacement of brain tissue; NPH → distortion of periventricular white matter fibres |
| ***Nutritional/Toxins*** | B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, alcohol, heavy metals, organic solvents, organophosphates | B12: impaired methylation → myelin damage + homocysteine accumulation → neurotoxicity. Alcohol: direct neurotoxicity + thiamine deficiency [2] |
| ***Traumatic*** | Chronic SDH, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE, "punch-drunk") | Chronic SDH: slow compression. CTE: repeated TBI → tau deposits (perivascular pattern) |
| ***Infectious*** | CJD, neurosyphilis, HIV, PML, AIDS-dementia complex, SSPE | CJD: prion protein misfolding → spongiform change. HIV: direct viral neurotoxicity + opportunistic infections |
| ***Autoimmune*** | Autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalitis, cerebral lupus, cerebral vasculitis, MS | Antibody-mediated neuronal injury or vasculitic ischaemia |

<Callout title="Reversible Causes — Must Screen!" type="error">
In every patient presenting with cognitive decline, you **must** screen for reversible causes. The standard "dementia screen" blood tests include: **TFTs** (hypothyroidism), **B12/folate**, **calcium**, **glucose/HbA1c**, **LFTs**, **RFTs**, **CBC**, **syphilis serology** (RPR/VDRL), and **HIV** (in appropriate patients). Brain imaging (CT or MRI) is also mandatory to exclude structural causes (tumours, NPH, chronic SDH).

## 6. Classification of Dementia

Dementia can be classified in multiple complementary ways [2]:

### 6.1 By Severity

| Stage | DSM-5 Term | Functional Status | Typical Neuropsych Score |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Subjective Cognitive Decline** | — | Normal function, subjective complaints | Normal testing |
| **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)** | Mild NCD | Independent (with greater effort); may need help with complex IADLs | 1–2 SD below mean |
| **Dementia (Mild)** | Major NCD — Mild | Needs help with IADLs (finances, medications, transport) | ≥2 SD below mean |
| **Dementia (Moderate)** | Major NCD — Moderate | Needs help with basic ADLs (dressing, bathing) | Significant impairment |
| **Dementia (Severe)** | Major NCD — Severe | Fully dependent for all ADLs | Profound impairment |

### 6.2 By Aetiology
- AD, VaD, Mixed (AD + VaD), FTD, DLB, PDD, CJD, NPH, alcohol-related, etc.

### 6.3 By Age of Onset [2]
- **Presenile (Early onset, < 65)**: More commonly FTD, CJD; more commonly genetically implicated; more rapid progression.
- **Senile (Late onset, ≥ 65)**: DLB and VaD more common; AD still most common in both groups.

### 6.4 By Anatomical Site Involved [2]

| Classification | Key Features | Prototype Diseases |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Anterior (Frontal)** | Behavioural changes, disinhibition, antisocial behaviour, irresponsibility | FTD, NPH, Huntington's |
| **Posterior (Parietal-Temporal)** | Memory loss, language disturbance, relatively preserved behaviour | AD |
| **Cortical** | Higher cortical dysfunction: aphasia, agnosia, apraxia, acalculia, true amnesia | AD, FTD |
| **Subcortical** | "Forgetfulness" (retrieval > encoding, improved by prompting), bradyphrenia, difficulty with complex tasks, apathy, flat/depressed mood, dysarthria, movement disorders | PD-dementia, PSP, CJD, HD, subcortical VaD |

---

## 7. Clinical Features

The clinical approach separates **cognitive symptoms** from **neuropsychiatric (behavioural and psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD)**, and **neurological signs**. We will cover each major dementia subtype.

### 7.1 Alzheimer's Disease — Clinical Features [2][4][5]

AD usually presents with ***memory deficit*** followed by other deficits, with an ***insidious onset*** and ***gradual progression***.

#### A. Cognitive Symptoms (and their pathophysiological basis)

| Symptom | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Progressive memory impairment (first abnormality)*** | ***Characteristic anterograde recent episodic amnesia early on*** [2]. Patient cannot learn new information — repeats questions, forgets appointments, misplaces items. Develops insidiously, gradually spreading to affect other aspects of memory. | Earliest pathology is in the **entorhinal cortex → hippocampus** (Braak stage I–III), the structures essential for encoding new episodic memories. Cholinergic loss from basal nucleus of Meynert further impairs memory consolidation. |
| ***Executive dysfunction*** | ***↓ organisation, problems with planning, abstract reasoning*** [2]. Difficulty managing finances, cooking complex meals, following recipes. | Spread of pathology to **prefrontal cortex** and disruption of frontal-subcortical circuits. Also related to cholinergic depletion affecting frontal networks. |
| ***Language (aphasia)*** | ***Word-finding or naming difficulties, impairment in verbal fluency*** [2]. Initially anomia → progresses to fluent aphasia → eventually global aphasia and mutism. | Spread to left **perisylvian cortex** (temporoparietal junction, Wernicke's area). Semantic store degradation as temporal neocortex is affected. |
| ***Visuospatial (apraxia, agnosia)*** | ***Difficulty in copying pictures, learning way round unfamiliar environment, disorientation*** (late) [2]. Gets lost, can't park, difficulty dressing. | Involvement of **parietal association cortex** (dorsal "where" stream). Posterior cortical atrophy variant presents predominantly with this. |
| ***Anosognosia (loss of insight)*** | ***Insight (anosognosia) is common but variable*** [2]. Patient is unaware of or minimises deficits. | Damage to **right parietal lobe** and frontal self-monitoring networks. This contrasts with depression where patients often *overestimate* their cognitive problems. |

#### B. Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (BPSD) [2]

***Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in AD, especially in the middle-to-late course*** [2]:

| Symptom | Prevalence / Details | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Depression*** | ***Major depression in 10%; less marked depression in > 50%*** [2] | Serotonergic and noradrenergic neuronal loss (raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus). Also a reactive/psychological response to awareness of decline. |
| ***Psychosis*** | ***Hallucinations (10–25%), delusions (10–50%), often persecutory themes including theft, phantom lodger*** [2] | Cholinergic depletion (especially in temporal/parietal cortex) + disrupted reality-monitoring networks. Misidentification syndromes from right hemisphere/parietal damage. |
| ***Behavioural disturbance*** | ***Aggression, wandering, sundowning (↑motor activity in evening), sexual dysfunction (disinhibition or ↓libido)*** [2] | Frontal lobe involvement → loss of inhibitory control. Sundowning may relate to disrupted circadian rhythm (suprachiasmatic nucleus degeneration) + evening fatigue + reduced environmental cues. |
| ***Sleep disturbance*** | ***Spend ↑time in bed awake, fragmented sleep*** [2] | Degeneration of suprachiasmatic nucleus + cholinergic/orexinergic system disruption → circadian dysregulation. |

#### C. Neurological Signs [2]

| Sign | Timing | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Anosmia*** | ***Often occurs early but usually neglected*** [2] | Early involvement of **olfactory bulb and entorhinal cortex** (which receives olfactory input). This is why anosmia can precede memory loss. |
| ***Seizures*** | ***Occur in 10–20%, usually in later stages*** [2] | Widespread cortical neuronal loss → aberrant electrical activity. Aβ itself may have pro-epileptogenic properties by disrupting synaptic inhibition. |
| ***Motor signs (pyramidal/extrapyramidal)*** | ***Usually in late stages*** [2] | Late spread to motor cortex and basal ganglia pathways. Extrapyramidal signs may reflect co-existing Lewy body pathology (mixed pathology is common). |

#### D. Clinical Course [2]

- ***Early stages***: Clinical picture often modified by premorbid personality with exaggeration of traits.
- ***Middle-late stages***: Cognitive impairment increasingly dominates with development of BPSD.
- ***Mortality***: Median survival 5–7 years (lecture slides state ***diagnosis to death 8–10 years*** [4]), with survival associated with older age of onset and rapid cognitive decline.
- Death is usually from intercurrent illness: aspiration pneumonia (swallowing apraxia), infections (immobility), falls.

### 7.2 Vascular Dementia — Clinical Features [2]

The hallmark is ***stepwise deterioration*** with ***usually preserved insight*** [2]:

#### A. Cognitive Symptoms

| Symptom | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Stepwise/fluctuating cognitive decline** | Periods of stability punctuated by sudden worsening (each step = new vascular event) | Each new infarct/haemorrhage destroys additional brain tissue → cumulative cognitive damage. |
| **Executive dysfunction** (prominent) | Problems with planning, sequencing, mental flexibility; may be more prominent than memory loss | Subcortical lacunar infarcts disrupt frontal-subcortical circuits. White matter ischaemia disconnects frontal lobes from subcortical structures. |
| **Patchy cognitive deficits** | Variable pattern depending on which vascular territories are affected | Unlike AD's relatively uniform progression, VaD depends on which specific vessels are occluded. A strategic infarct (e.g. thalamus, angular gyrus) can cause sudden dramatic decline. |
| **Relatively preserved memory** (early) | Especially in subcortical VaD — retrieval-type "forgetfulness" rather than encoding failure | Hippocampus may be spared if infarcts are subcortical. Retrieval pathways (frontal-subcortical) are disrupted rather than storage (hippocampus). |

#### B. Neuropsychiatric Symptoms [2]

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:---|:---|
| ***Depression (more common than in AD)*** | Disruption of frontal-limbic circuits by white matter lesions; "vascular depression" hypothesis. |
| ***Labile mood, pseudobulbar affect*** | Bilateral disruption of corticobulbar tracts → disinhibition of emotional expression centres in brainstem. Pseudobulbar affect = pathological laughing/crying disproportionate to emotion. |
| ***Apathy, anxiety*** | Frontal-subcortical circuit disruption. |
| ***Personality changes*** | Frontal lobe ischaemia. |
| ***Abulia (amotivation)*** | Bilateral medial frontal/anterior cingulate damage → loss of drive/initiative. |

#### C. Neurological Signs [2]

| Sign | Basis |
|:---|:---|
| **Focal neurological deficits** | Correspond to specific infarct locations (hemiparesis, hemianopia, hemisensory loss, etc.) |
| **Gait disturbance** (early) | Subcortical white matter damage → small-stepped, shuffling "marche à petits pas" |
| **Pseudobulbar palsy** | Bilateral corticobulbar tract damage → dysarthria, dysphagia, exaggerated jaw jerk, pseudobulbar affect |
| **Extrapyramidal signs** | Basal ganglia lacunar infarcts |
| **Urinary incontinence** (early) | Frontal lobe damage → loss of social inhibition of micturition; also disruption of pontine micturition centre pathways |

#### D. Clinical Course [2]
- ***Stepwise progression*** with periods of deterioration and improvements.
- Life expectancy variable but usually shorter than AD (~5 years), with ***~50% dying from IHD*** [2].

### 7.3 Dementia with Lewy Bodies — Clinical Features [2]

DLB presents with a characteristic combination of **cortical + subcortical** features:

#### A. Core Cognitive Feature

***Dementia characterised by early impairments in attention, executive and visuospatial function (memory affected late)*** [2].

Why is memory relatively preserved early? Because the **hippocampus is relatively spared** in DLB (unlike AD where it's the first target). Instead, Lewy bodies concentrate in cortical association areas, causing attention, executive, and visuospatial deficits first.

#### B. Core Clinical Features (Must have ≥ 2 for probable DLB) [2]

| Feature | Prevalence | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Cognitive fluctuations*** | ***60–80%*** | ***Fluctuation of attention, alertness and cognitive performance. Episodes of "blanking out", daytime drowsiness, bizarre behaviour, interspersed with periods of near-normal function*** [2] | Fluctuating cholinergic transmission in cortex + brainstem arousal system dysfunction (Lewy bodies in brainstem reticular formation, pedunculopontine nucleus). |
| ***Visual hallucinations*** | ***67%*** | ***Occurs early in the illness; typically well-formed and detailed*** [2] (e.g. seeing people, animals, children — often not distressing initially) | Lewy body pathology in **occipital visual cortex** + cholinergic depletion affecting visual processing. Also posterior cortical dysfunction releasing "top-down" imagery. |
| ***REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD)*** | ***85%*** | ***Characterised by dream enactment behaviour, e.g. vocalisation, complex motor behaviour*** [2] (acting out dreams — punching, kicking, shouting in sleep) | Loss of normal **REM atonia** due to Lewy body pathology in **brainstem nuclei** (sublaterodorsal nucleus/subcoeruleus region) that normally inhibit spinal motor neurons during REM. |
| ***Parkinsonism*** | ***70–90%*** | ***Usually more bilaterally symmetric and milder than in PD*** [2] | Lewy bodies in **substantia nigra** → dopaminergic loss. More symmetric because cortical/limbic Lewy body burden may be more diffuse compared to PD. |

#### C. Supportive Features [2]

| Feature | Significance |
|:---|:---|
| ***Antipsychotic sensitivity (30–50%)*** | ***Acute irreversible Parkinsonism, LOC ± NMS towards antipsychotics*** [2]. This is a **critical clinical point** — never give typical antipsychotics (haloperidol) to suspected DLB! Even atypicals can worsen. This occurs because dopaminergic pathways are already severely compromised; blocking the few remaining D2 receptors → catastrophic motor and autonomic deterioration. |
| **Repeated falls, syncope, transient LOC** | Autonomic dysfunction (Lewy bodies in sympathetic ganglia, brainstem autonomic centres) → orthostatic hypotension. |
| **Autonomic dysfunction** | Constipation, urinary incontinence, postural hypotension — all from peripheral and central autonomic Lewy body deposits. |
| **Hypersomnia, hyposmia** | Brainstem and olfactory bulb pathology. |
| **Other hallucinations, systematised delusions, apathy/anxiety/depression** | Cortical Lewy body burden affecting multiple circuits. |

<Callout title="DLB vs AD — Key Distinguishing Points" type="idea">
**DLB**: Early visuospatial/executive deficits, cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, RBD, Parkinsonism, preserved medial temporal lobe on MRI, **antipsychotic sensitivity**.
**AD**: Early memory loss (episodic, anterograde), gradual progression without fluctuations, hallucinations/motor signs usually late, hippocampal atrophy on MRI.
</Callout>

### 7.4 Frontotemporal Dementia — Clinical Features [2]

FTD is divided into two major subtypes with ***prominent behavioural/psychiatric symptoms*** [2]:

| Feature | ***Behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD)*** | ***Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA)*** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Core presentation** | Behavioural and personality changes | Early, progressive language disturbance with relative sparing of other domains |
| **Specific features** | ***Behavioural disinhibition*** (e.g. public urination, inappropriate sexual comments) — *Why?* Orbitofrontal cortex damage → loss of social inhibition. | ***Non-fluent variant (nfvPPA)***: Articulation difficulty, agrammatism — *Why?* Left posterior frontoinsular atrophy (Broca's area region). |
| | ***Apathy/inertia and loss of empathy*** — *Why?* Medial frontal and anterior cingulate damage → loss of motivation and emotional processing. | ***Semantic variant (svPPA)***: Impaired word comprehension and object knowledge — *Why?* Anterior temporal lobe atrophy (semantic memory store). |
| | ***Executive dysfunction***: Perseveration, hyperorality (putting inappropriate things in mouth, dietary changes — sweet food craving), ritualistic behaviour — *Why?* Dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal dysfunction. | ***Logopenic variant***: Word-finding pauses, sentence repetition difficulty — *Why?* Left temporoparietal junction; often underlying AD pathology. |
| | ***Early loss of insight*** — *Why?* Right frontal lobe → self-awareness. | |
| | ***Primitive reflexes*** (grasp, palmomental) — *Why?* Frontal lobe release signs when frontal cortex damaged. | |
| **Key distinction from AD** | Behaviour and personality change dominate EARLY; memory relatively preserved initially. | Language deficits are the dominant and earliest feature, not memory. |

### 7.5 Other Notable Dementias — Clinical Features

**Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)** [2]:
- ***Rapidly progressive dementia*** (weeks to months, not years)
- ***Myoclonic jerks***, seizures, cerebellar ataxia
- ***Young onset with early psychiatric symptoms*** in variant CJD (vCJD — linked to BSE)
- Caused by prion protein (PrPSc) misfolding → spongiform change → rapid neuronal death

**Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)** [2]:
- Classical ***triad***: **Frontal dementia** ("wet, wacky, and wobbly" = urinary incontinence, dementia, gait apraxia)
- **Mental slowing, apathy, inattention** (subcortical/frontal pattern)
- Commonest in 50–70 year age group
- *Why?* CSF circulation impaired → ventriculomegaly → stretching of **periventricular white matter fibres** (especially those serving the legs → gait affected first, then bladder, then cognition)
- **Importantly reversible** with VP shunting

**Alcohol-Related Dementia** [2]:
- ~50–70% of alcohol abusers have some cognitive deficits
- Multifactorial: direct ethanol neurotoxicity + head injury + vascular changes + nutritional deficiency (thiamine)
- ***Clinical picture simulates frontal lobe dementia*** [2] — *Why?* Frontal lobes are most susceptible to alcohol neurotoxicity
- Neuroimaging: ***cerebral cortical atrophy with enlarged lateral ventricles, loss of grey matter, white matter changes with demyelination*** [2]
- Diagnosed 8 weeks after abstinence (to allow acute effects to clear)

### 7.6 Comparing Key Dementia Subtypes — Clinical Features Summary [2]

| Feature | AD | VaD | DLB | FTD |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Onset** | Insidious, > 65 | Variable, late 60s–70s | ~75y, M > F | ~58y, presenile |
| **First symptom** | Memory (episodic) | Variable (executive common) | Attention/visuospatial | Behaviour/language |
| **Progression** | Gradual, relentless | Stepwise | Fluctuating | Variable |
| **Memory** | Early, severe | Variable, retrieval-type | Late | Relatively preserved |
| **Hallucinations** | Late (10–25%) | Uncommon | ***Early, visual, well-formed*** | Uncommon |
| **Motor signs** | Late | Focal deficits, gait | ***Parkinsonism (symmetric, mild)*** | Primitive reflexes |
| **Insight** | Lost early | ***Preserved*** | Variable | ***Lost early*** |
| **Key neuroimaging** | Hippocampal/MTL atrophy | Infarcts, WML | ***Preserved MTL*** | Frontal/temporal atrophy |
| **Unique features** | Aphasia, apraxia, agnosia | Pseudobulbar affect, urinary incontinence | ***RBD, cognitive fluctuations, antipsychotic sensitivity*** | Disinhibition, hyperorality, loss of empathy |

## 8. Neuropsychological Assessment

Understanding how we test for dementia is clinically important:

### Screening Tools

| Tool | Description | Strengths | Limitations |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **MMSE** (Mini-Mental State Examination) | 30-point scale; tests orientation, registration, recall, attention, language, visuospatial | Widely used, quick (5–10 min) | Biased by education level; poor for executive function, visuospatial; copyright issues |
| **MoCA** (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) | 30-point scale; better coverage of executive function, visuospatial, abstraction | More sensitive for MCI; better for subcortical/executive deficits; ***MoCA more appropriate for VaD*** [2] | Slightly longer; also education-biased |
| **CDT** (Clock Drawing Test) | Ask patient to draw clock face with all numbers and set hands to specific time | Quick screen for executive + visuospatial; captures frontal and parietal dysfunction | Cannot be used alone; not comprehensive |

### Detailed Neuropsychological Testing [2]
- **F-A-S test** (phonemic fluency): Name words starting with F, A, S in 1 minute each — tests executive function and language [2].
- **Category fluency** (semantic fluency): Name animals in 1 minute — tests semantic memory and executive function.
- **Trail Making Test A & B**: Tests attention and executive function (set-shifting).
- **Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure**: Tests visuospatial construction and visual memory.

## 9. Approach to a Patient with Suspected Dementia [2]

The clinical approach involves three steps:

1. **Assessment of severity and clinical profile**: From ***history*** and ***neuropsychological testing*** [2]
2. **Establishing the diagnosis of dementia**: Rule out alternative ***differentials*** by ***physical examination*** and ***investigations*** [2]
3. **Identifying the underlying cause**: From ***symptoms/signs*** ± ***neuroimaging*** [2]

### History Taking — Key Points

- **Collateral history is essential** — patients with dementia often lack insight and minimise symptoms. Always speak to a family member/carer.
- **Onset and progression**: Insidious (AD, FTD) vs stepwise (VaD) vs rapid (CJD) vs fluctuating (DLB)?
- **First symptoms**: Memory (AD) vs behaviour (FTD) vs visuospatial (DLB) vs executive (VaD)?
- **BPSD**: Hallucinations, delusions, depression, aggression, wandering, sleep disturbance?
- **Functional decline**: IADLs (finances, medication, transport, cooking) → BADLs (dressing, bathing, eating)?
- **Medical history**: Vascular RFs, prior stroke, head injury, thyroid disease, alcohol use, medications (anticholinergics!)?
- **Family history**: Dementia, psychiatric disease, movement disorders?
- **Drug history**: Many medications worsen cognition — anticholinergics (diphenhydramine, oxybutynin), benzodiazepines, opioids, antihistamines.

### Physical Examination

- **General**: Nutritional status, thyroid examination
- **Neurological**: Focal deficits (VaD), Parkinsonism (DLB/PDD), primitive reflexes (FTD), myoclonus (CJD), gait (NPH)
- **Cardiovascular**: AF, carotid bruits, BP (vascular RFs)
- **Mental state examination**: Including cognitive screening (MMSE/MoCA)

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Definition**: Dementia = chronic, progressive syndrome of global cognitive decline (≥1 domain, DSM-5; ≥2, ICD-10) without impaired consciousness, causing functional impairment. DSM-5 term: Major Neurocognitive Disorder.

**Epidemiology**: 9.1% prevalence in HK > 65y; prevalence doubles every 5 years after 65; projected to triple by 2050.

**Top 3 causes**: ***AD (50–60%) > VaD (10–20%) > DLB (~10%)***. Mixed dementia (AD + VaD) is very common.

**AD pathophysiology**: Aβ42 accumulation (amyloid cascade) + tau hyperphosphorylation (NFTs) → neuronal loss. Starts in entorhinal cortex/hippocampus → spreads cortically. Cholinergic deficit from basal nucleus of Meynert degeneration.

**AD genetics**: Early-onset: APP, PSEN1 (>70%), PSEN2 (all autosomal dominant). Late-onset: APOE ε4 (~50% of vulnerability).

**AD clinical**: Insidious onset, anterograde episodic amnesia first, then executive → language → visuospatial → BPSD → motor signs. Duration 8–10 years.

**VaD**: Stepwise decline, preserved insight, executive dysfunction prominent, focal neurology, depression/labile mood. RF management is key.

**DLB**: Early visuospatial/executive deficits, cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations (early, well-formed), RBD, symmetric mild Parkinsonism, ***antipsychotic sensitivity*** (NEVER give typical antipsychotics), preserved MTL on MRI.

**FTD**: Young onset (~58y), bvFTD (disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, hyperorality) vs PPA (language variants). Highly heritable (C9ORF72, MAPT, GRN). Pick's bodies (tau inclusions).

**Reversible causes**: Always screen — "DEMENTIA" mnemonic. Blood tests: TFTs, B12/folate, calcium, glucose, LFTs, RFTs, syphilis serology. Brain imaging mandatory.

**Classification**: By severity (MCI vs dementia), aetiology, age of onset (presenile < 65 vs senile ≥ 65), anatomy (cortical vs subcortical, anterior vs posterior).

**Cortical vs Subcortical**: Cortical = true amnesia, aphasia, apraxia, agnosia (AD, FTD). Subcortical = retrieval-type forgetfulness (improved by prompting), bradyphrenia, apathy, movement disorders (VaD subcortical, PDD, HD).
