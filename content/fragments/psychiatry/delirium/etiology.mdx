## 1. Definition

**Delirium** — from the Latin *de-* ("off, away from") + *lira* ("furrow, track"), literally meaning "off the track" or "derailed" — is an ***acute confusional state*** characterised by impairment in both ***consciousness*** and ***cognition*** [1][2].

Think of it this way: the brain's "operating system" has crashed. Unlike dementia, where specific "programs" (memory, language) fail one by one, delirium is a global system failure — the whole computer is glitching. It represents a ***common final pathway of disrupted cerebral homeostasis*** [2].

<Callout title="Core Concept">
Delirium is NOT a disease in itself — it is a **syndrome** (a clinical manifestation of an underlying medical insult). Finding delirium means you must find the cause. It is the brain's "fever" — a non-specific alarm signal that something is physiologically wrong.
</Callout>

Key definitional features:
- **Acute onset** (hours to days, not weeks to months)
- **Fluctuating course** (classically worse at night — "sundowning")
- **Impaired attention** (the cardinal, hallmark feature)
- **Altered level of consciousness** (distinguishes it from dementia)
- **Evidence of an underlying medical cause** (always)

## 2. Epidemiology

| Setting | Prevalence / Incidence |
|:---|:---|
| General hospitalised patients | ***14–24%*** at any point [2] |
| Elderly presenting to A&E | ***10–30%*** harbour a life-threatening condition [2] |
| Post-surgical (esp. hip fracture, cardiac surgery) | 15–53% |
| ICU patients | 60–80% (mechanically ventilated) |
| Palliative care / terminal illness | Up to 85% |
| Nursing home residents | 10–40% |

- **Prevalence increases with age** — because ***cerebral reserve*** (the brain's ability to tolerate physiological insults) diminishes with age [2]
- ***35–40% 1-year mortality*** in older patients presenting to A&E with delirium [2]
- **Massively under-recognised**: ***> 70% of delirium cases are missed*** by clinical teams, especially the hypoactive subtype (the "quiet" delirious patient who is just drowsy) [2]

> **High Yield**: Delirium is an **independent predictor of mortality**. Mortality data: ***14% at 1 month, 22% at 6 months, 6× that of non-delirious patients*** [2]. It also confers a ***5× increased incidence of dementia within 2 years*** [2].

### Hong Kong Context
- Hong Kong has a rapidly ageing population (> 20% aged ≥ 65 by 2026). Delirium is extremely common on geriatric, orthopaedic, and medical wards in the Hospital Authority system.
- Polypharmacy in elderly patients (multiple chronic medications) is a major driver.
- Common precipitants in HK include urinary tract infections, pneumonia, constipation, dehydration, and medication changes (especially after admission).

## 3. Risk Factors

The concept here is **predisposing factors** (baseline vulnerability) × **precipitating factors** (acute insult) = delirium. A patient with high baseline vulnerability (e.g., demented, elderly, sensory impaired) needs only a minor precipitant (e.g., a urinary catheter insertion, constipation) to tip into delirium. A young, healthy patient would need a massive insult (e.g., major surgery, septic shock) [2].

### 3.1 Predisposing Factors (Baseline Vulnerability)

| Factor | Why it predisposes |
|:---|:---|
| ***Dementia*** | Reduced cognitive reserve — the brain is already operating at its limit |
| ***Previous episode of delirium*** | Indicates underlying brain vulnerability |
| ***Older age*** | Reduced cerebral reserve, ↓ cholinergic neurons, ↓ cerebral blood flow |
| ***Functional impairment*** | Marker of frailty and reduced physiological reserve |
| ***Sensory impairment*** (vision/hearing) | Reduced external orientation cues → the brain "fills in gaps" with misperceptions |
| ***History of cerebrovascular disease*** | Pre-existing brain damage reduces reserve |
| ***Alcohol misuse*** | Chronic neurotoxicity, thiamine deficiency, liver disease |
| Severe comorbid illness | Multiple organ systems are already stressed |

### 3.2 Precipitating Factors (Acute Insult)

The classic mnemonic is ***DELIRIUM(S)*** [2]:

| Letter | Category | Examples |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **D** | **Drugs** | Anticholinergics, opioids, benzodiazepines, steroids, digoxin, diuretics, polypharmacy |
| **E** | **Electrolytes** | Hypo/hypernatraemia, hypercalcaemia, hypo/hyperglycaemia |
| **L** | **Low oxygen** | Hypoxia (pneumonia, PE, COPD exacerbation, post-operative) |
| **I** | **Infection** | ***UTI, respiratory infection***, septicaemia, meningitis/encephalitis |
| **R** | **Retention** (of urine or faeces) | Urinary retention, constipation → surprisingly potent precipitants |
| **I** | **Ictogenic** (seizures) | Post-ictal states, non-convulsive status epilepticus |
| **U** | **Underhydration / Undernutrition** | Dehydration, malnutrition, thiamine/B12 deficiency |
| **M** | **Metabolic** (especially glucose) | Hepatic encephalopathy, uraemia, hypo/hyperglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, abnormal albumin |
| (S) | **Subdural / Structural** | Head injury, space-occupying lesions, stroke |

Additional precipitants from lecture slides and notes [1][2]:
- ***Use of physical restraints*** (worsens agitation, ↓ orientation)
- ***Bladder catheter*** (discomfort, infection risk, unfamiliar sensation)
- ***Pain*** (uncontrolled pain is a major precipitant)
- ***Sleep deprivation*** (disrupts circadian regulation of neurotransmitters)
- ***Constipation*** (often overlooked!)
- ***Unfamiliar environment*** (ICU, post-transfer between wards)

### 3.3 Six Causes of Confusion in Alcoholism (Lecture Slide — High Yield)

***Six causes of confusion in alcoholism*** [1]:
1. ***Intoxication***
2. ***Delirium tremens (DT)***
3. ***Head injury*** (alcoholics fall frequently)
4. ***Metabolic disturbances (e.g., hypoglycaemia)***
5. ***Hepatic encephalopathy***
6. ***Wernicke encephalopathy***

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl" type="error">
Never assume a confused alcoholic patient is "just drunk." You must systematically exclude all six causes listed above. Missing Wernicke encephalopathy or a subdural haematoma from a fall is a catastrophic and avoidable error. Always give **thiamine BEFORE glucose** in alcoholics — glucose without thiamine can precipitate or worsen Wernicke encephalopathy by exhausting remaining thiamine stores.
</Callout>

## 4. Anatomy and Functional Basis

Understanding delirium requires understanding what "consciousness" and "attention" actually are neuroanatomically.

### 4.1 Consciousness

Consciousness has two components:
1. **Arousal** (wakefulness): Governed by the **ascending reticular activating system (ARAS)** in the brainstem (pons, midbrain), which projects diffusely to the thalamus and cortex. Damage or dysfunction here → reduced level of arousal (drowsiness → stupor → coma).
2. **Awareness** (content of consciousness): Governed by the **cerebral cortex**, especially the association cortices. Damage here → confusion, disorientation, impaired cognition.

In delirium, **both arousal and awareness** are disrupted — this is what distinguishes it from dementia (where arousal is preserved until very late stages).

### 4.2 Attention

- Attention is the ability to **select and sustain focus** on relevant stimuli while filtering out irrelevant ones.
- Key structures: **prefrontal cortex** (executive control), **posterior parietal cortex** (spatial attention), **thalamus** (sensory gating), and the **reticular formation** (alerting).
- **Acetylcholine (ACh)** is the primary neurotransmitter for attentional processing (basal forebrain cholinergic system — nucleus basalis of Meynert).
- This is why **anticholinergic drugs** are such potent precipitants of delirium — they directly impair the attentional system.

### 4.3 Circadian Rhythm

- The **suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)** of the hypothalamus is the master circadian clock.
- It regulates the sleep-wake cycle via melatonin (from the pineal gland) and cortisol.
- In delirium, disruption of these circuits (by inflammation, medications, ICU environment) leads to the characteristic **sleep-wake cycle disturbance**.

### 4.4 Neurotransmitter Systems Involved

| System | Role in delirium |
|:---|:---|
| **Acetylcholine (ACh)** ↓ | **Central to delirium pathophysiology.** Reduced cholinergic transmission → impaired attention, memory, and cortical processing. This is why anticholinergic drugs cause delirium and why demented patients (who already have ACh deficiency) are vulnerable. |
| **Dopamine (DA)** ↑ | Excess dopamine → psychomotor agitation, hallucinations, delusions. This is why **antipsychotics** (dopamine blockers) help in hyperactive delirium. |
| **GABA** | Altered GABAergic tone — relevant in hepatic encephalopathy (excess GABA-ergic activity) and alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal (sudden loss of GABA-ergic activity). |
| **Glutamate** | Excitotoxicity via NMDA receptors may contribute to neuronal injury in prolonged delirium. |
| **Serotonin (5-HT)** | Serotonin syndrome can cause delirium; serotonin excess contributes to agitation and autonomic instability. |
| **Melatonin** ↓ | Disruption of circadian regulation → sleep-wake cycle disturbance. |

---

## 5. Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of delirium is ***poorly understood*** [2], but several converging hypotheses exist. Think of them as overlapping mechanisms rather than competing theories:

### 5.1 Neuroinflammatory Hypothesis (Most Important)

1. A systemic insult (infection, surgery, trauma) triggers a **systemic inflammatory response** (↑ IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α).
2. These pro-inflammatory cytokines cross the **blood-brain barrier** (BBB), which becomes more permeable with age, illness, and inflammation.
3. Within the brain, **microglial activation** occurs → neuroinflammation → impaired neuronal function.
4. This disrupts neurotransmitter synthesis and release, particularly **reducing acetylcholine** and **increasing dopamine**.
5. The result: global cortical dysfunction → delirium.

Why does this explain the clinical features?
- ↓ ACh → impaired attention, memory, orientation
- ↑ DA → hallucinations, agitation, psychosis
- Neuroinflammation → diffuse cortical dysfunction → fluctuating symptoms

### 5.2 Cholinergic Deficiency Hypothesis

- Acetylcholine is the most critical neurotransmitter for sustained attention and cortical arousal.
- Any insult that ↓ ACh synthesis (hypoxia, hypoglycaemia) or blocks ACh receptors (anticholinergic drugs) can precipitate delirium.
- **Serum anticholinergic activity** correlates with delirium severity in some studies.
- This is why the elderly are so vulnerable — they already have age-related cholinergic decline.

### 5.3 Oxidative Stress Hypothesis

- Cerebral hypoxia, hypoperfusion, or metabolic derangement → impaired oxidative metabolism → reduced ATP production → neuronal dysfunction.
- The brain is exquisitely sensitive to metabolic insults because it consumes ~20% of total body oxygen despite being only ~2% of body weight.

### 5.4 Neural Network Disconnection

- Recent neuroimaging studies (fMRI, EEG) show that delirium involves a **breakdown of functional connectivity** between brain networks — particularly the default mode network, the dorsal attention network, and thalamocortical circuits.
- **EEG characteristically shows diffuse slowing of background cortical activity** [2] — reflecting global cortical hypofunction.

### 5.5 Neurotransmitter Imbalance Summary

```
Systemic insult → Systemic inflammation → BBB breach →
Neuroinflammation (microglial activation) →
↓ Acetylcholine + ↑ Dopamine + ↓ Melatonin →
Impaired attention + psychosis + sleep-wake disruption →
DELIRIUM

## 6. Aetiology (with Hong Kong Focus)

### 6.1 Classification by Cause

| Category | Common causes | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Infections** | UTI, pneumonia, cellulitis, septicaemia, meningitis/encephalitis | ***UTI and pneumonia are the #1 precipitants in HK elderly*** |
| **Metabolic** | Hypo/hypernatraemia, hypercalcaemia, hypo/hyperglycaemia, uraemia, hepatic encephalopathy, metabolic acidosis, abnormal albumin | Check electrolytes, glucose, renal/liver function |
| **Drugs** | ***Anticholinergics, opioids, benzodiazepines, steroids, digoxin, diuretics*** [2] | Polypharmacy is a huge problem in HK elderly |
| **Substance-related** | ***Alcohol intoxication, withdrawal, delirium tremens*** [1][2] | See delirium tremens section below |
| **Hypoxia** | Post-operative, pneumonia, PE, COPD, heart failure | ***Post-operative delirium is extremely common*** |
| **Organ failure** | ***Renal, hepatic, cardiac failure*** | Hepatic encephalopathy is a classic cause |
| **Neurological** | Post-ictal, head injury, stroke, space-occupying lesion, encephalitis, non-convulsive status epilepticus | Always consider in acute-onset confusion |
| **Nutritional** | ***Thiamine deficiency (Wernicke), B12, folate*** | Especially in alcoholics and malnourished elderly |
| **Other** | ***Pain, urinary retention, constipation, sleep deprivation, physical restraints, bladder catheter*** [2] | These "minor" precipitants are commonly missed |

### 6.2 Delirium Tremens (DT) — Special Case

***Delirium tremens*** is the ***severe form of alcohol withdrawal*** [1]:

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| **Timing** | ***Occurs 24–96 hours after abstention*** [1] |
| **Clinical features** | ***Confusion, hallucinations, severe agitation, seizures*** [1] |
| **Mortality** | ***5%*** [1] |
| **Status** | ***Medical emergency requiring hospitalisation*** [1] |

***Management of delirium tremens*** [1]:
- ***Benzodiazepines in decreasing dosage (lorazepam/diazepam/others)*** — first-line
- ***Anticonvulsants (carbamazepine)*** — for seizure prophylaxis/treatment
- ***Proactive use of parenteral vitamins (thiamine)*** — ALWAYS give thiamine before glucose
- ***Neuroleptics for control of agitation***
- ***Fluid and electrolyte balance***

**Why benzodiazepines are first-line in DT but second-line in other delirium**: In alcohol withdrawal, the problem is sudden loss of GABA-ergic activity (alcohol chronically potentiates GABA receptors → withdrawal removes this → GABA underactivity → excitotoxicity, seizures). Benzodiazepines directly replace the lost GABA-ergic activity. In contrast, in most other forms of delirium, benzodiazepines can worsen confusion because they are sedating and have paradoxical effects in the elderly.

## 7. Classification

### 7.1 By Psychomotor Activity

| Subtype | Features | Prevalence | Prognosis |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Hyperactive*** | Agitation, restlessness, hallucinations, pulling at lines/tubes, combativeness | ~25% | Better (because it gets noticed and treated) |
| ***Hypoactive*** | Drowsiness, lethargy, reduced responsiveness, psychomotor slowing, withdrawn | ~25% | ***Worse prognosis*** [2] — often missed ("quiet delirium") |
| ***Mixed*** | Fluctuates between hyperactive and hypoactive states ***unpredictably*** | ~35% | Intermediate |
| Unclassifiable | Does not fit neatly into above categories | ~15% | Variable |

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl" type="error">
**Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly missed subtype** and carries the **worst prognosis** because it is often mistaken for depression or normal sleepiness, leading to delayed treatment. The patient who is "just a bit drowsy" may be delirious. Always screen for inattention in any patient with altered behaviour.
</Callout>

### 7.2 By Aetiology (DSM-5)

- ***Substance intoxication delirium***
- ***Substance withdrawal delirium***
- ***Medication-induced delirium***
- ***Delirium due to another medical condition***
- ***Delirium due to multiple aetiologies***

### 7.3 By Duration (DSM-5)

- ***Acute***: hours to days
- ***Persistent***: weeks to months

### 7.4 By Relationship to Dementia (ICD-10)

- ***Not superimposed on dementia (F05.0)***
- ***Superimposed on dementia (F05.1)*** — this is extremely common and is the hardest to diagnose

---

## 8. Clinical Features

The clinical features of delirium are a variety of ***neuropsychiatric disturbances*** [2]. I will separate these systematically into symptoms and signs, with the pathophysiological basis explained inline.

### 8.1 Symptoms (What the Patient/Carer Reports)

#### 8.1.1 Impaired Consciousness
- **Drowsiness, lethargy, reduced arousal** → due to disruption of the ***ascending reticular activating system (ARAS)*** and thalamocortical circuits by neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter imbalance
- **Disorientation** — classically ***time > place > person*** (time orientation is the most fragile and first to go because it requires continuous updating by working memory, which depends on intact attention and prefrontal function) [2]
- In severe cases → **stupor or coma** (profound ARAS dysfunction)

#### 8.1.2 Impaired Attention (The ***Hallmark*** of Delirium)
- ***Distractibility*** during conversations [2] — the patient cannot maintain focus; they drift off mid-sentence, are drawn to irrelevant stimuli. This is because the prefrontal cortex and basal forebrain cholinergic system (which sustain attention) are dysfunctional.
- Inability to follow commands or track a conversation
- Cannot maintain a coherent train of thought
- **Testing**: ***serial sevens*** (subtract 7 from 100 repeatedly), days of the week backwards, months of the year backwards, digit span [2]

> **High Yield**: Impaired attention is the ***hallmark*** [2] and the **most specific feature** that distinguishes delirium from other conditions. If attention is normal, it is unlikely to be delirium.

#### 8.1.3 Cognitive Disturbance
- ***Generally global*** — involving ***memory loss, difficulty with language/speech*** [2]
- ***Thinking is slow and muddled, but often rich in content (dream-like)*** [2] — this "dream-like" quality occurs because the brain is generating internal imagery (similar to dreaming) due to disrupted thalamocortical gating. The thalamus normally filters sensory input; when it fails, internal representations intrude into consciousness.
- **Disorientation** (as above)
- **Memory impairment**: Primarily affects **registration** (laying down new memories) and **short-term memory** because these depend on sustained attention. Remote memory may be relatively preserved.
- **Executive dysfunction**: Impaired planning, judgment, and problem-solving (prefrontal cortex dysfunction)

#### 8.1.4 Psychosis-like Symptoms
- ***Perceptual disturbances***: ***illusions*** (misinterpretation of real stimuli, e.g., mistaking an IV pole for a person) and ***hallucinations*** (***especially visual hallucinations***) [2]
  - **Why visual hallucinations?** Visual processing requires complex cortical integration (occipital → temporal → parietal). When cortical function is globally disrupted, the visual system is particularly vulnerable to generating false percepts. Also, ↑ dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway promotes hallucinations.
  - Auditory hallucinations can occur but are less prominent than in primary psychotic disorders
- ***Delusions/abnormal beliefs***: ***typically referential or persecutory*** but ***usually transient and poorly elaborated*** [2] — meaning the patient may believe staff are trying to poison them, but they cannot give you a detailed, fixed delusional system (unlike schizophrenia where delusions are often systematised)
- ***Disorganised thinking***: ***disorganised or incoherent speech, rambling or irrelevant conversations*** [2] — reflecting global cortical dysfunction disrupting the language and thought-organisation networks

#### 8.1.5 Sleep-Wake Cycle Disturbance (Another ***Hallmark***)
- ***Can range from daytime drowsiness + nighttime insomnia to complete sleep cycle reversal*** [2]
- ***Another hallmark of delirium*** [2]
- **Pathophysiology**: Disruption of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) → melatonin circuit. Inflammation, hospital environment (constant light, noise in ICU), and medications all disrupt circadian rhythmicity. ↓ Melatonin secretion has been documented in delirious patients.

#### 8.1.6 Mood Disturbance
- ***Variable, may be labile*** [2]
- ***May involve depression, euphoria, anxiety, anger, fear, apathy*** [2]
- Mood lability (rapid swings between emotional states) reflects prefrontal cortical disinhibition and limbic system dysregulation
- **Fear and anxiety** are especially common in hyperactive delirium — imagine being in a dream state where you are confused, misperceiving your environment, and unable to understand what is happening to you

#### 8.1.7 Psychomotor Disturbance (Reported by Carers)
- ***Can be hypo- or hyperactive and can shift between these states unpredictably*** [2]
- **Hyperactive**: agitation, restlessness, pulling at tubes/lines, trying to get out of bed, combativeness
- **Hypoactive**: lethargy, withdrawal, reduced spontaneous movement, minimal speech
- Reflects the balance between dopaminergic excess (hyperactive) and cholinergic deficit (hypoactive)

#### 8.1.8 Course (How the Symptoms Evolve Over Time)
- ***Acute onset with diurnal fluctuation*** (***usually worse at night***) [2]
- ***Lasting days to months*** (***< 6 months in ICD-10***) [2]
- **Why worse at night ("sundowning")?** At night: ↓ environmental orientation cues (reduced lighting, fewer staff interactions), ↓ melatonin disruption becomes more apparent, and sensory deprivation increases the brain's tendency to generate internal percepts (hallucinations)

### 8.2 Signs (What the Clinician Observes on Examination)

| Sign | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Reduced level of consciousness** | GCS may be reduced; patient may be drowsy or difficult to rouse | ARAS dysfunction |
| **Inattention** | Cannot follow commands, loses thread of conversation, fails serial sevens or digit span | Cholinergic deficit in prefrontal-basal forebrain circuits |
| **Disorientation** | Especially to time; may not know date, day, month, year | Requires continuous updating by working memory (attention-dependent) |
| **Cognitive impairment** | MMSE/MoCA scores are acutely reduced from baseline | Global cortical dysfunction |
| **Abnormal speech** | ***Incoherent, rapid or slow*** [2]; may be rambling, disorganised | Disrupted language networks (Wernicke/Broca circuits) + executive dysfunction |
| **Perceptual abnormalities** | Visual hallucinations (patient picking at bedsheets — "carphologia"), illusions | Thalamocortical gating failure + dopaminergic excess |
| **Psychomotor changes** | Agitation, restlessness, or lethargy, hypokinesia | Dopaminergic-cholinergic imbalance |
| **Autonomic signs** (especially in hyperactive delirium) | Tachycardia, hypertension, sweating, tremor, mydriasis | Sympathetic nervous system activation (especially in withdrawal states) |
| **Asterixis** (negative myoclonus) | "Liver flap" — if hepatic encephalopathy is the cause | Metabolic encephalopathy disrupting motor cortex |
| **Multifocal myoclonus** | Irregular, asymmetric jerking movements | Diffuse cortical irritability from metabolic derangement |
| **Fluctuating examination** | Findings change between visits, even within the same day | Inherent property of delirium — fluctuating cortical dysfunction |

### 8.3 Delirium vs Dementia — Key Distinguishing Features

This table is **extremely high yield** for exams [2]:

| Feature | Delirium | Dementia |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Onset*** | ***Acute*** | ***Gradual*** |
| ***Duration*** | ***Hours to weeks*** | ***Months to years*** |
| ***Course*** | ***Fluctuating*** | ***Progressive deterioration*** |
| ***Consciousness*** | ***Altered*** | ***Normal*** (until very late stages) |
| ***Context*** | ***New illness/medication*** | ***Health unchanged*** |
| ***Perceptual disturbance*** | ***Common*** | ***Occurs in late stages*** |
| ***Sleep-wake cycle*** | ***Disrupted*** | ***Usually normal*** |
| ***Orientation*** | ***Usually impaired for time and unfamiliar people/places*** | ***Impaired in late stages*** |
| ***Speech*** | ***Incoherent, rapid or slow*** | ***Word finding difficulties*** |
| ***Attention*** | **Profoundly impaired (hallmark)** | **Relatively preserved until late** |

<Callout title="Critical Distinction" type="error">
Delirium and dementia frequently **coexist** (delirium superimposed on dementia, ICD-10 F05.1). In fact, dementia is the **single strongest predisposing factor** for delirium. When a demented patient suddenly worsens, **always rule out delirium first** — do not attribute the deterioration to "progression of dementia." Cognitive fluctuations can occur in dementia (especially Lewy body dementia and as "sundowning" in Alzheimer's), but **any change from the patient's baseline pattern of fluctuation should prompt evaluation for delirium** [2].
</Callout>

### 8.4 Clinical "Red Flags" That Should Prompt You to Think Delirium

- Any **acute** change in cognition or behaviour from baseline
- New-onset confusion in any hospitalised patient
- Agitation or combativeness in a previously calm patient
- Sudden drowsiness or withdrawal not explained by medications
- New visual hallucinations
- Acute deterioration in a patient with known dementia
- Post-operative confusion (especially in elderly after hip fracture or cardiac surgery)
- Alcohol withdrawal 24–96 hours after last drink
