## Diagnostic Criteria, Algorithm, and Investigations for Cluster B Personality Disorders

### The Nature of Personality Disorder Diagnosis

Before diving into specific criteria, it is crucial to understand that diagnosing a personality disorder is fundamentally **different** from diagnosing most Axis I psychiatric disorders or medical conditions. There is no blood test, no imaging finding, no single pathognomonic sign. The diagnosis is **clinical** — based on a thorough longitudinal assessment of the patient's enduring patterns of thinking, feeling, relating, and behaving [2].

> Think of it this way: diagnosing pneumonia requires a snapshot (CXR, cultures, exam findings at a point in time). Diagnosing a personality disorder requires a **time-lapse film** — you need to see the pattern across years, across relationships, across life domains. A single clinical encounter is almost never sufficient.

Key diagnostic principles [2]:
- ***Presentation: often at times of stress and distress as majority tend not to regard own personality as inherently abnormal*** — patients rarely present saying "I think I have a personality disorder." They present in crisis (self-harm, relationship breakdown, substance misuse), and the personality disorder is recognised as the underlying pattern
- ***Diagnosis: clinicians often agree on presence of PD but disagree on subtype*** — this reflects the categorical model's limitations and the substantial overlap between PD types
- ***Assessment should cover: source of distress (thoughts, emotions, behaviour, relationships) to self and others; functional impairment at work, home, social circumstances; any comorbid psychiatric illness; strengths and weaknesses of individual*** [2]

### General Diagnostic Criteria for Personality Disorders

Both DSM-5 and ICD-10/ICD-11 require that **general criteria** for any personality disorder be met before applying specific subtype criteria. These general criteria establish that the presentation truly represents an enduring personality pattern rather than an episodic psychiatric illness.

#### DSM-5 General Criteria for Personality Disorder [2]

| Criterion | Description | Why This Criterion Exists |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **A** | An enduring pattern of inner experience and behaviour that **deviates markedly** from the expectations of the individual's culture, manifested in **≥2 of**: (1) **Cognition** — ways of perceiving and interpreting self, others, and events; (2) **Affectivity** — range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response; (3) **Interpersonal functioning**; (4) **Impulse control** | Ensures the disturbance is *pervasive* — not just one narrow domain. Requiring ≥2 areas prevents over-diagnosis of normal personality variation. The "cultural expectations" clause acknowledges that personality norms are culturally bound |
| **B** | The pattern is **inflexible and pervasive** across a broad range of personal and social situations | Distinguishes PD from situation-specific reactions (e.g., adjustment disorder). A person who is only difficult at work but charming at home does not have a PD |
| **C** | Leads to clinically significant **distress or impairment** in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning | Prevents pathologising personality *traits* that don't cause problems. Many people have narcissistic or histrionic traits without meeting disorder criteria |
| **D** | The pattern is **stable and of long duration**, traceable to **adolescence or early adulthood** | The most critical criterion — distinguishes *trait* from *state*. An enduring pattern since adolescence cannot be an Axis I episode |
| **E** | Not better explained by another mental disorder | Ensures hierarchical diagnosis is considered — e.g., impulsivity during a manic episode is better explained by bipolar disorder |
| **F** | Not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition | Rules out secondary personality change — e.g., frontal lobe injury, substance intoxication/withdrawal |

#### ICD-10 General Criteria (F60) [2]

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **G1** | Evidence that characteristic and enduring patterns of inner experience and behaviour deviate markedly from culturally expected norms in ≥2 of: cognition, affectivity, control over impulses, ways of relating to others |
| **G2** | The deviation is manifest as **inflexible, maladaptive, or otherwise dysfunctional** behaviour across a broad range of situations |
| **G3** | There is **personal distress or adverse impact on social environment** |
| **G4** | Evidence that the deviation is **stable, of long duration**, and with onset in late childhood or adolescence |
| **G5** | The deviation **cannot be explained by** another adult mental disorder (though it may coexist) |
| **G6** | The deviation is **not due to** organic brain disease, injury, or dysfunction |

> The ICD-10 and DSM-5 general criteria are remarkably similar — both establish the same core concept: the pattern must be enduring, pervasive, cause distress/impairment, and not be better explained by something else.

<Callout title="Why Must Onset Be in Adolescence/Early Adulthood?" type="idea">
This criterion exists because personality is *formed* during childhood and adolescence through the interaction of genetics, temperament, and experience [2]. A personality disorder represents a **developmental derailment** — the personality crystallised around maladaptive patterns during the formative years. New-onset "personality change" in adulthood should prompt investigation for organic causes (head injury, brain tumour, neurodegenerative disease, substance use) or enduring personality change after catastrophic experience or psychiatric illness [2].
</Callout>

### Specific Diagnostic Criteria for Each Cluster B PD

#### A. Borderline Personality Disorder (DSM-5 Criteria)

A pervasive pattern of **instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects**, and marked **impulsivity**, beginning by early adulthood, as indicated by **≥5 of 9**:

| # | Criterion | Mnemonic Letter | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| 1 | ***Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment*** [1][2] | **A** (Abandonment) | Insecure/disorganised attachment → hypervigilance to rejection cues |
| 2 | ***Unstable, intense relationships fluctuating between extremes of idealisation and devaluation*** [1][2] | **I** (Interpersonal instability) | Splitting defence mechanism — inability to integrate "good" and "bad" qualities of others |
| 3 | ***Unstable self-image / identity disturbance*** — markedly and persistently unstable sense of self [1][2] | **I** (Identity) | Failed development of coherent self through consistent caregiver mirroring |
| 4 | ***Impulsivity*** in ≥2 areas that are potentially self-damaging (***sex, binge eating, substance abuse, spending money***, reckless driving) [1][2] | **I** (Impulsivity) | ↓serotonin + ↓prefrontal inhibitory control → impulsive acts as maladaptive emotion regulation |
| 5 | ***Repetitive suicidal behaviour or self-harm*** — including gestures, threats, self-mutilating behaviour [1][2] | **S** (Suicidality/Self-harm) | Endorphin release from physical pain temporarily relieves emotional pain; also communicates distress |
| 6 | ***Fluctuations in mood*** — affective instability due to marked reactivity (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, anxiety usually lasting a few hours) [1][2] | **M** (Mood instability) | Amygdala hyperreactivity to interpersonal stimuli → intense, rapid emotional responses |
| 7 | ***Chronic feelings of emptiness*** [1][2] | **E** (Emptiness) | Identity disturbance → pervasive void; chronic stress-induced reward circuit downregulation |
| 8 | Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights) | **A** (Anger) | ↓serotonergic tone + amygdala hyperreactivity → low threshold for aggressive response |
| 9 | ***Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation*** or severe ***dissociative*** symptoms [1][2] | **D** (Dissociation/paranoia) | Under extreme stress, prefrontal function further deteriorates → transient psychotic-like symptoms |

> **Mnemonic for BPD criteria: "AM I SAID?"** — Abandonment fears, Mood instability, Identity disturbance, Suicidality/Self-harm, Anger, Impulsivity, Dissociation/paranoia (transient), Emptiness (chronic), unstable relationships (Devaluation/idealisation). Some use "PRAISE" or "IMPULSIVE" variants — use whichever sticks.

#### ICD-10: Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (F60.3) [2]

ICD-10 divides this into two subtypes:

| Subtype | Key Features |
|---------|-------------|
| **Impulsive type (F60.30)** | Emotional instability, lack of impulse control, outbursts of violence or threatening behaviour (especially in response to criticism) |
| **Borderline type (F60.31)** | All features of impulsive type PLUS disturbances of self-image, chronic emptiness, intense unstable relationships, self-harm, and frantic abandonment avoidance |

> The ICD-10 impulsive type captures patients who have the emotional dysregulation and impulsivity but *without* the identity disturbance and splitting pattern — it is essentially a less severe or incomplete BPD presentation.

---

#### B. Antisocial Personality Disorder (DSM-5 Criteria)

A pervasive pattern of **disregard for and violation of the rights of others**, occurring since **age 15**, as indicated by **≥3 of 7**:

| # | Criterion | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 | ***Repeated unlawful or aggressive behaviour*** — failure to conform to social norms [1][2] | ↓prefrontal moral reasoning + ↓serotonin impulse control |
| 2 | ***Deceitfulness, lying*** — repeated lying, use of aliases, conning others for personal gain [1][2] | Instrumental behaviour — lying works because of superficial charm; ↓moral reasoning means no internal inhibition |
| 3 | ***Impulsive; takes risks without concern for safety*** — failure to plan ahead [2] | ↓serotonin + ↓prefrontal executive function + ↓amygdala fear response |
| 4 | ***Irritable*** and aggressive — repeated physical fights or assaults [2] | Low-activity MAO-A → excess catecholamines → ↑reactive aggression; ↓5-HT2A receptor function |
| 5 | ***Reckless irresponsibility*** — disregard for safety of self or others [2] | ↓OFC reward/punishment processing → cannot weigh consequences |
| 6 | ***Irresponsible and departs from social norms*** — consistent irresponsibility (e.g., failure to sustain work, honour financial obligations) [1][2] | Pattern of choosing immediate reward over long-term consequences |
| 7 | ***Striking lack of guilt or remorse*** — being indifferent to or rationalising having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another [2] | ***Does not change behaviour with punishment*** [2] — ↓amygdala fear conditioning → punishment produces no emotional learning |

**Additional mandatory criteria:**
- Individual is **≥18 years old** (cannot diagnose ASPD in a minor)
- ***Preceded by conduct disorder before age 15*** [2] — evidence of conduct disorder with onset before 15
- The pattern is not exclusively during episodes of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder

#### ICD-10: Dissocial Personality Disorder (F60.2) [2]

Requires ≥3 of: callous unconcern for others' feelings; gross irresponsibility and disregard for social norms; incapacity to maintain enduring relationships; very low frustration tolerance and low threshold for aggression; incapacity to experience guilt; marked proneness to blame others or rationalise behaviour.

---

#### C. Histrionic Personality Disorder (DSM-5 Criteria)

A pervasive pattern of **excessive emotionality and attention seeking**, beginning by early adulthood, as indicated by **≥5 of 8**:

| # | Criterion | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 | Uncomfortable when not the centre of attention | Core drive: attention = validation = safety from underlying insecurity |
| 2 | Interaction with others often characterised by ***inappropriately seductive*** or provocative behaviour [2] | Oversexualisation of relationships as primary strategy for obtaining attention |
| 3 | Displays rapidly shifting and ***shallow*** emotions [2] | ***Shallow labile affect*** [1] — emotions are performed rather than deeply felt |
| 4 | Consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention (***over-concerned with physical attractiveness***) [2] | Appearance as tool for narcissistic supply/attention |
| 5 | Has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail | Vague, dramatic communication prioritises emotional impact over content |
| 6 | Shows ***self-dramatisation*** — theatricality, exaggerated expression of emotion [2] | ***Emotional blackmail, angry scenes, demonstrative suicide attempts*** [2] |
| 7 | Is ***suggestible, especially by figures of authority*** [2] | Poorly consolidated self-identity → looks to others for direction |
| 8 | Considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are | Distorted perception of relational closeness reflects need for connection |

#### ICD-10: Histrionic Personality Disorder (F60.4)

Similar criteria emphasising self-dramatisation, suggestibility, shallow affect, egocentric behaviour, and desire for excitement.

---

#### D. Narcissistic Personality Disorder (DSM-5 Criteria)

A pervasive pattern of **grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy**, beginning by early adulthood, as indicated by **≥5 of 9**:

| # | Criterion | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 | ***Grandiose sense of self-importance*** — exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognised as superior [2] | Defensive grandiosity protecting fragile core self-esteem |
| 2 | Preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love | Fantasies sustain the grandiose self when reality does not provide adequate narcissistic supply |
| 3 | Believes they are "special" and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other high-status people (***tries to associate with rich, famous people***) [2] | Reflected glory — associating with high-status others enhances self-image |
| 4 | ***Excessive need for admiration*** [2] | Admiration is "psychological oxygen" — without it, the self deflates |
| 5 | Sense of entitlement — unreasonable expectations of especially favourable treatment (***considers self as deserving of special treatment***) [2] | Grandiosity extends to expectations of how the world should treat them |
| 6 | Interpersonally exploitative — takes advantage of others (***superficial and exploitative relationships***) [2] | Others exist as "self-objects" providing narcissistic supply, not as separate individuals |
| 7 | ***Lack of empathy*** — unwilling to recognise or identify with the feelings of others [2] | ***Structural differences in neural circuitry for empathy*** [2]; can cognitively read emotions but affective resonance is absent |
| 8 | Often envious of others or believes others are envious of them | Envious comparisons threaten the grandiose self; projecting envy onto others preserves superiority |
| 9 | Shows arrogant, haughty behaviours or attitudes (***boastful and pretentious***) [2] | External expression of internal grandiosity |

> **Note:** NPD is **not classified separately in ICD-10** [1]. However, ICD-11's dimensional model captures NPD features through the **Dissociality** trait domain (callousness, grandiosity, manipulativeness, lack of empathy).

---

### ICD-11 Diagnostic Approach (Dimensional Model)

ICD-11 represents a paradigm shift from the categorical model. Here is how it works for Cluster B presentations:

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| **1. Determine if PD is present** | Does the patient have a persistent disturbance in functioning of self (identity, self-worth, self-direction) AND/OR interpersonal (empathy, intimacy, cooperativeness) that: manifests across situations, is of long duration, causes distress or impairment? |
| **2. Determine severity** | **Mild**: some areas of functioning are impaired; **Moderate**: most areas are impaired; **Severe**: most areas are severely impaired and the person is a danger to self or others |
| **3. Apply trait domain qualifiers** | Assign one or more: **Negative Affectivity** (emotional lability, anxiety, insecurity), **Detachment** (social withdrawal, blunted affect), **Dissociality** (callousness, grandiosity, manipulation), **Disinhibition** (impulsivity, recklessness, irresponsibility), **Anankastia** (perfectionism, rigidity) |
| **4. Borderline pattern qualifier** | Optionally add if the pattern fits BPD — emotional instability, identity disturbance, self-harm, splitting, abandonment fears |

> **Mapping Cluster B to ICD-11**: BPD → Negative Affectivity + Disinhibition + Borderline pattern; ASPD → Dissociality + Disinhibition; HPD → Negative Affectivity + Disinhibition; NPD → Dissociality (grandiosity domain)

<Callout title="The 'Five-Step' Diagnostic Approach — Exam Framework">
When asked to diagnose a Cluster B PD in an exam vignette, follow this sequence:
1. **Exclude organic** — always first (head injury, substance, medical)
2. **Exclude primary Axis I** — is the pattern better explained by bipolar, depression, psychosis, etc.?
3. **Apply general PD criteria** — enduring, pervasive, onset in adolescence, distress/impairment
4. **Apply specific subtype criteria** — which Cluster B PD fits best?
5. **Screen for comorbidities and risk** — what Axis I disorders coexist? What is the suicide/violence risk?

### Assessment Tools and Investigations

#### A. Clinical Assessment (The Gold Standard)

Personality disorder diagnosis is fundamentally a **clinical diagnosis** based on detailed history-taking and mental state examination. No investigation replaces this.

| Assessment Component | What to Assess | Why It Matters |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Comprehensive psychiatric history** | Personal history from childhood to present, developmental milestones, family dynamics, school/work performance, relationships, forensic history | Establishes the **longitudinal pattern** — the hallmark of PD. Particularly important: childhood adversity (abuse, neglect, separation), conduct disorder before 15 (for ASPD) |
| **Relationship history in detail** | Pattern of relationships — who initiates, who ends them, why, how does the patient feel during and after breakups, pattern of idealisation-devaluation | The interpersonal pattern is often the most diagnostically informative element |
| **Mental state examination** | Current affect, thought content, perceptions (pseudohallucinations?), cognition, insight | Helps identify acute Axis I comorbidity superimposed on personality disorder |
| ***Collateral history*** | From family members, partners, previous medical records, school reports | **Essential** — patients with PDs often lack insight into their own patterns. Collateral gives the "external view" of the enduring pattern. Also confirms childhood onset |
| **Risk assessment** | Suicide, self-harm, violence to others — at every contact | BPD: 10% suicide mortality; ASPD: risk of violence; NPD: risk during narcissistic crisis [2] |
| ***Strengths and weaknesses*** | Coping skills, social supports, intelligence, occupational skills, motivation for change [2] | ***Important in subsequent treatment*** [2] — treatment plans must build on existing strengths |
| **Countertransference awareness** | Clinician's own emotional response to the patient | A powerful diagnostic signal — see clinical features section |

#### B. Structured and Semi-Structured Diagnostic Interviews

These are **research-grade tools** that improve diagnostic reliability. They are not routinely used in clinical practice in Hong Kong but are important to know for exams:

| Tool | Format | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Personality Disorders (SCID-5-PD)** | Semi-structured interview | The gold standard research tool. Covers all 10 DSM-5 PDs systematically. Requires training to administer |
| **International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE)** | Semi-structured interview | Based on ICD-10 and DSM criteria. Used internationally |
| **Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines – Revised (DIB-R)** | Semi-structured interview | Specific for BPD. Assesses affect, cognition, impulsivity, and interpersonal relationships |
| **Hare Psychopathy Checklist – Revised (PCL-R)** | Clinician-rated scale | Assesses psychopathic traits in ASPD. Scores 0–40; ≥30 = psychopathy. Used primarily in forensic settings. Captures interpersonal/affective features (Factor 1) and lifestyle/antisocial features (Factor 2) that ASPD criteria alone miss |

#### C. Self-Report Screening Instruments

Useful as screening tools but **NOT diagnostic** on their own:

| Tool | Application | Interpretation |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4 (PDQ-4+)** | Self-report, screens for all DSM PDs | High sensitivity, low specificity — good for ruling OUT PD, poor for ruling IN |
| **McLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD)** | 10-item self-report screen for BPD | Score ≥7 suggests BPD; sensitivity ~81%, specificity ~85%. Quick, useful in busy clinical settings |
| **Zanarini Rating Scale for BPD (ZAN-BPD)** | Clinician-administered, measures BPD severity | Useful for tracking treatment response over time |
| **Standardised Assessment of Personality – Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS)** | 8-item screening interview | Score ≥3 suggests presence of PD (any type); useful first step before detailed assessment |
| **Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5)** | Self-report, measures the 5 trait domains of the DSM-5 alternative model | Captures dimensional traits — useful for the ICD-11 dimensional approach |
| ***Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)*** | Dimensional personality assessment [2] | Used more in research; clinically impractical for routine diagnosis [2] |

#### D. Investigations to Exclude Organic Causes

These are **not for diagnosing** personality disorders but for **ruling out** secondary personality change or organic mimics:

| Investigation | Indication | Key Findings to Look For |
|---------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Basic bloods: FBC, RFT, LFT, TFT, CRP, glucose** | Any new presentation of personality change in adulthood | Thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism mimics depression; hyperthyroidism mimics anxiety/irritability), hepatic encephalopathy, hypoglycaemia, metabolic disturbances |
| **Urine drug screen** | When substance use is suspected as a contributing/confounding factor | Stimulants (amphetamines, cocaine) can mimic grandiosity and impulsivity; cannabis can cause amotivation; opioid withdrawal mimics emotional instability |
| **Syphilis serology (VDRL/RPR, FTA-ABS)** | New-onset personality change, especially with disinhibition | Neurosyphilis (general paresis of the insane) causes personality change with grandiosity — historically important, still relevant |
| **HIV testing** | Young adults with new-onset behavioural change, especially with risk factors | HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder can cause personality change, disinhibition, impulsivity |
| **CT/MRI Brain** | New-onset personality change in middle-aged/older patients; focal neurological signs; head injury history | ***Organic brain lesion: extreme social disinhibition with no gross mood disorder → frontal lobe pathology*** [2] — look for frontal lobe tumours, meningiomas, frontotemporal dementia, traumatic brain injury sequelae |
| **EEG** | Episodic behavioural disturbance suggesting temporal lobe epilepsy | Temporal lobe epilepsy can cause interictal personality change (Geschwind syndrome: hyperreligiosity, hypergraphia, altered sexuality, viscosity, emotional intensification) |
| **Neuropsychological testing** | When cognitive impairment is suspected alongside personality change | May reveal frontal lobe executive dysfunction, ADHD (which can coexist with or mimic Cluster B features) |

<Callout title="When to Investigate Aggressively" type="error">
The red flags for secondary (organic) personality change that mandate investigation are:
- **New onset in adulthood** — personality disorders by definition begin in adolescence/early adulthood. New "personality change" at age 45 is NOT a primary PD
- **No childhood precursors** — no history of conduct disorder, attachment difficulties, or personality traits in adolescence
- **Focal neurological signs** — even subtle (anosmia → frontal lobe; visual field defects → temporal lobe)
- **Disproportionate disinhibition** with no emotional distress — suggestive of frontal pathology
- **Progressive worsening** — PDs are stable or improve with age; progressive deterioration suggests neurodegeneration
</Callout>

#### E. Assessment for Comorbidities

Once a Cluster B PD is diagnosed, systematic screening for comorbidities is essential:

| Comorbidity to Screen For | Screening Approach |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Major Depression** | PHQ-9, clinical interview; prevalence in Cluster B is very high |
| **Bipolar Disorder** | Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ); detailed mood history including eliciting past hypomania |
| **Anxiety Disorders** | GAD-7, clinical interview |
| **PTSD / C-PTSD** | PCL-5, Life Events Checklist; especially in BPD given ~70-80% trauma history |
| **Substance Use** | AUDIT (alcohol), DAST-10 (drugs), urine toxicology |
| **Eating Disorders** | SCOFF questionnaire; particularly in BPD (binge eating) and HPD |
| **ADHD** | Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS); especially when impulsivity and inattention are prominent |
| **Other PDs** | Full personality assessment — patients commonly meet criteria for >1 PD |

---

### Practical Diagnostic Considerations

| Issue | Guidance |
|-------|---------|
| **Minimum age for diagnosis** | DSM-5 allows PD diagnosis in **under-18s** if features have been present ≥1 year and are pervasive (except ASPD which requires age ≥18). In practice, clinicians are cautious about labelling adolescents and may prefer "emerging personality disorder" or "PD traits." ICD-11 allows diagnosis at any age if criteria are met |
| **Diagnosis during crisis** | **Never diagnose a PD solely on the basis of a single crisis presentation.** The patient presenting to A&E after an overdose may have BPD, or they may have an adjustment disorder, or they may be in a depressive episode with personality traits. Longitudinal assessment is mandatory |
| **Cultural considerations** | What constitutes "dramatic" or "emotional" is culturally determined. In Hong Kong, emotional expressiveness norms differ from Western populations. Be cautious about diagnosing HPD in individuals whose culture values emotional display |
| **The "diagnosis of exclusion" trap** | PD should NOT be a "dustbin diagnosis" applied when nothing else fits. It requires **positive diagnostic criteria** to be met, not just the absence of another explanation |
| **Documentation** | Because PD diagnoses can be stigmatising and follow patients for life, they should be made thoughtfully, with clear documentation of the evidence supporting the diagnosis |

<Callout title="Diagnostic Pitfall: The 'Difficult Patient' Label" type="error">
Patients who are "difficult" in clinical encounters are sometimes reflexively labelled as having a personality disorder. This is both diagnostically lazy and potentially harmful — it can lead to dismissal of genuine distress and under-treatment of comorbid conditions. A proper PD diagnosis requires meeting specific criteria with longitudinal evidence, not just a clinician's frustration. Cluster B PDs do cause ***difficult relationships with clinicians*** and patients are ***often excluded from care*** [2], but this should prompt structured assessment, not avoidance.
</Callout>

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Diagnostic Criteria — Key Points:**
- DSM-5 general PD criteria require enduring pattern in ≥2 of cognition/affectivity/interpersonal/impulse control, inflexible and pervasive, causing distress/impairment, traceable to adolescence, not explained by another disorder or substance/medical condition
- **BPD**: ≥5/9 criteria (AM I SAID mnemonic); ICD-10 = Emotionally Unstable PD (impulsive and borderline subtypes)
- **ASPD**: ≥3/7 criteria + age ≥18 + conduct disorder before age 15; ICD-10 = Dissocial PD
- **HPD**: ≥5/8 criteria; ICD-10 = Histrionic PD
- **NPD**: ≥5/9 criteria; NOT separately classified in ICD-10

**Diagnostic Algorithm — Five Steps:**
1. Exclude organic causes
2. Exclude primary Axis I disorders
3. Apply general PD criteria (enduring, pervasive, distress/impairment, onset in adolescence)
4. Apply specific subtype criteria
5. Screen for comorbidities and assess risk

**Investigations:**
- PD diagnosis is **clinical** — no lab test or imaging confirms it
- Investigations serve to **exclude organic mimics** (bloods, urine tox, neuroimaging) and **screen for comorbidities**
- Structured interviews (SCID-5-PD) are the research gold standard; screening tools (MSI-BPD, SAPAS) are useful first-line
- Red flags for organic cause: new onset in adulthood, no childhood precursors, focal neurology, progressive worsening
