## 1. Definition and Conceptual Overview

Child and adolescent psychiatry (also called "paedopsychiatry") deals with psychiatric conditions presenting before the age of 18. The phrase **"Other Psychiatric Conditions in Child Psychiatry"** is a catch-all for the conditions that sit outside the "big" neurodevelopmental disorders (ASD, ADHD) and externalising behaviour disorders (ODD, CD) — namely:

1. **Anxiety disorders of childhood**
2. **Youth (childhood/adolescent) depression**
3. **Disorders of social functioning** (selective mutism, attachment disorders)
4. **Sibling rivalry disorder**
5. **Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children**

The unifying principle is that many adult psychiatric conditions **do** occur in children but manifest differently because:

- The developing brain has a different neurobiological substrate at each age.
- Children lack the metacognitive vocabulary to articulate internal states → symptoms "leak out" as somatic complaints, behavioural disturbance, or irritability.
- Developmental stage colours the *content* of symptoms (e.g., an infant's anxiety is about strangers; an adolescent's anxiety is about social evaluation — same circuit, different trigger).

> Think of it this way: the limbic system matures early, but the prefrontal cortex (which modulates it) is still under construction until the mid-20s. So children feel the full force of anxiety and low mood but lack the cortical "brakes" to rationalise or regulate those feelings. That's why you see more behavioural expression and fewer cognitive symptoms.

## 2. Epidemiology

### 2.1 Overall Burden

| Condition | Prevalence | Sex Ratio | Peak Onset |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anxiety disorders (all types) | **Commonest psychiatric disorder of childhood** (~5-15% of children) [1][2] | Slight F > M (especially post-puberty) | Varies by subtype (see below) |
| Separation anxiety disorder | 3-5% of school-age children | Slight F > M | 7-9 years |
| Specific phobias | 5-10% | F > M | Early childhood |
| Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) | 1-2% in children, rises in adolescence | F > M | Early adolescence (10-13y) |
| GAD | 1-3% of children | F > M | Late adolescence |
| Panic disorder | Rare before puberty, 1-2% in adolescents | F > M | Late adolescence |
| Youth depression | **< 1% pre-pubertal** (M:F ≈ 1:1), rises **drastically after puberty** (1-year prevalence ~4%, F > M ≈ 2:1) [1] | See left | Adolescence |
| Selective mutism | 0.7-0.8% | Slight F > M | Before age 5 |
| Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) | Rare, < 1% (but higher in institutional care/foster care) | M ≈ F | Early childhood |
| PTSD in children | Variable (10-25% after significant trauma) | F > M in adolescence | Any age |
| Sibling rivalry disorder | Common clinically but rarely formally diagnosed | M ≈ F | Typically after birth of a new sibling |

### 2.2 Hong Kong Context

- Hong Kong data suggest child psychiatric disorders affect ~10-15% of children/adolescents.
- High academic pressure culture → disproportionate rates of anxiety (especially performance anxiety, test anxiety) and youth depression.
- Rising referral rates to child psychiatric services in Hong Kong, with anxiety and ADHD being the most common referral diagnoses.
- Selective mutism may be under-recognised in bilingual (Cantonese–English) environments where language switching can mask symptoms.
- Youth suicide is a significant public health concern in HK, often linked to untreated depression.

## 3. Anatomy and Function (Neurodevelopmental Basis)

Understanding child psychiatric conditions requires a developmental neuroanatomy perspective. The key circuits involved are:

### 3.1 The Fear/Anxiety Circuit

| Structure | Function | Developmental Timing | Relevance to Child Anxiety |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Amygdala** | Threat detection, fear conditioning, activates autonomic "fight-or-flight" | Functional from birth, relatively mature early | Early maturation explains why children can experience intense fear responses even in infancy |
| **Hypothalamus** (dorsomedial/perifornical) | Coordinates autonomic, endocrine and behavioural stress responses via HPA axis | Functional early | Explains somatic manifestations of anxiety (tachycardia, sweating, GI symptoms) |
| **Prefrontal cortex** (VMPFC, dorsolateral PFC) | Top-down *inhibitory* regulation of amygdala; cognitive appraisal of threat | **Slow maturation — not fully mature until mid-20s** | Children have a "maturity gap": strong amygdala activation with weak prefrontal braking → difficulty regulating anxiety |
| **Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)** | Error monitoring, conflict detection, regulation of emotional response | Gradual maturation | Dysfunction → difficulty extinguishing fear (relevant to PTSD, OCD) |
| **Insula** | Interoception (awareness of bodily states like heartbeat, gut feeling) | Increasingly active through childhood | Overactive insula → amplification of somatic anxiety symptoms → somatic complaints |
| **Hippocampus** | Contextual memory, distinguishing safe vs. dangerous contexts | Vulnerable to cortisol; volume may decrease with chronic stress | Cortisol-induced hippocampal atrophy → impaired context discrimination → generalised anxiety; also → ↓5HT neurotransmission [1] |

### 3.2 The Reward/Mood Circuit

| Structure | Function | Relevance to Youth Depression |
|---|---|---|
| **Ventral striatum / Nucleus accumbens** | Reward processing (dopamine-mediated) | Hypoactivity → anhedonia |
| **Ventromedial PFC** | Emotional regulation, social cognition | ↑ activity → depressive ruminations, ↑ pain sensitivity, anxiety [1] |
| **Dorsolateral PFC** | Executive functions, working memory | Hypoactivity → psychomotor retardation, apathy, concentration problems [1] |
| **Hippocampus** | Memory consolidation, cortisol feedback | Reduced volume in depression (both predisposing and consequence) [1] |
| **Subgenual cortex (Brodmann area 25)** | Mood regulation, sadness | Volume reduction and ↓ glial cells in depression [3] |

### 3.3 The Monoamine Systems

| System | Nuclei of Origin | Projection Targets | Role in Child Psychiatry |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Serotonin (5-HT)** | Raphe nuclei (brainstem) | Cortex, limbic system, hypothalamus | Mood regulation, anxiety modulation, impulse control; **dysregulated in anxiety and depression** [1] |
| **Noradrenaline (NA)** | Locus coeruleus | Cortex, amygdala, hippocampus | Arousal, vigilance, stress response; **dysregulated in anxiety** [1] |
| **Dopamine (DA)** | VTA, substantia nigra | Prefrontal cortex, striatum | Reward, motivation, executive function; relevant to ADHD, depression (anhedonia) |

> These monoamine-releasing neurones belong to the **reticular activating system (RAS)**, which regulates global behavioural states — sleep-wake cycle, appetite, motor activity, emotional processing, learning and memory [1]. Deficiency in these neurotransmitters accounts for the broad clinical picture of depression (sleep disturbance, appetite changes, psychomotor changes, mood symptoms, cognitive impairment).

### 3.4 The HPA Axis in Children

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the master stress response system:

1. **Hypothalamus** releases CRH → 
2. **Anterior pituitary** releases ACTH →
3. **Adrenal cortex** releases **cortisol** →
4. Cortisol feeds back to hypothalamus and hippocampus (negative feedback)

In children exposed to **chronic stress/adversity**:
- The HPA axis becomes **dysregulated** (blunted or exaggerated cortisol response).
- Chronic cortisol elevation → **hippocampal atrophy** → impaired negative feedback → more cortisol → vicious cycle.
- This is the neurobiological basis for why **early life adversities** (abuse, neglect, parental separation) are such powerful risk factors for both anxiety and depression [1][3].

## 4. Aetiology and Pathophysiology

### 4.1 General Aetiological Framework

Child psychiatric conditions follow a **biopsychosocial model** where genetics load the gun, environment pulls the trigger, and developmental stage determines the expression.

### 4.2 Anxiety Disorders of Childhood

#### 4.2.1 Genetics
- **Weak-to-moderate** genetic contribution (heritability ~30-40%) [1]
- Familial aggregation: 5× risk in first-degree relatives [2]
- Candidate genes: those affecting **serotonin** and **noradrenaline** systems, including serotonin transporter gene (*5-HTTLPR*), *COMT*, *TMEM132D* [2]
- Shared genetic risk with depression (the genetic boundary between anxiety and depression is blurry)

#### 4.2.2 Neurobiology
- **Dysregulated 5-HT/NA systems** → explains why SSRIs and SNRIs work [1]
- **Overactive behavioural inhibition system (BIS)** may underlie the physiology of anxiety [1]
  - The BIS (Gray's model) is a neural system that responds to novelty, punishment cues, and non-reward by increasing arousal, inhibiting behaviour, and directing attention to threat
  - Children with an overactive BIS are temperamentally inhibited — they freeze, withdraw, and become distressed in novel situations
  - This is the neurobiological basis for **behavioural inhibition** as a temperamental risk factor

> **Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS):** Think of it as the brain's "alarm system" that says "stop, something might be dangerous." In anxious children, this alarm is set too sensitively — it goes off for minor threats that other children would ignore.

#### 4.2.3 Temperament
- **Behavioural inhibition** (a temperamental trait characterised by withdrawal and distress in novel situations) is a well-established risk factor [1]
- Present from early infancy, relatively stable over time
- ~40% of behaviourally inhibited children go on to develop an anxiety disorder (vs ~15% of uninhibited children)

#### 4.2.4 Attachment and Parenting
- **Anxious attachment**: creates a bidirectional escalating effect — anxious mother transmits anxiety to child through modelling, and the child's anxiety reinforces the mother's anxiety → escalating anxiety in the mother-child dyad [1]
- **Overprotective parenting**: prevents child from developing mastery over feared situations → maintains anxiety
- **Parental modelling**: anxious parents model avoidant coping → child learns that the world is dangerous
- ***Low care and overprotective parents*** are risk factors shared with bipolar and mood disorders [4]

#### 4.2.5 Cognitive Factors
- Anxious children show **attentional bias toward threat** — they notice and attend to threatening stimuli more than non-anxious children
- They also show **interpretation bias** — ambiguous situations are interpreted as threatening
- These cognitive biases are the target of **CBT** in childhood anxiety

#### 4.2.6 Life Events
- Stressful life events, particularly those involving **loss, threat, and uncertainty**, can precipitate anxiety disorders
- ***Childhood adversities*** (neglect, physical/sexual abuse, parental separation) are strong risk factors [1][3][4]

### 4.3 Youth Depression

#### 4.3.1 Genetics
- Similar genetic basis to adult depression (~37% heritability from twin studies) [1]
- **5-HTTLPR variant** (short allele of serotonin transporter gene) is associated with **early onset depression** in the presence of adversities [1]
  - This is the classic **gene × environment interaction**: the gene alone doesn't cause depression, but it increases vulnerability when combined with stressful life events

#### 4.3.2 Neurobiology
- **Cortisol-induced atrophic changes in hippocampus → ↓5-HT neurotransmission** [1]
  - Why? The hippocampus is rich in glucocorticoid receptors. Chronic stress → chronic cortisol → hippocampal neuronal damage → reduced serotonergic tone → depression
- **HPA axis dysregulation** — same mechanism as described above [3]
- ***Structural brain changes: volume reduction and decreased quantity of glial cells in subgenual cortex, reduced hippocampal size*** [3]
- ***Hormonal changes: dysregulation of HPA axis, lower estradiol (in women) and testosterone (in men), decreased T3 and TSH, diminished BDNF level*** [3]
  - BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) supports neuronal survival and growth; low levels → impaired neuroplasticity → vulnerability to depression
- **Monoamine hypothesis**: deficiency in 5-HT, NA, and DA [1]

#### 4.3.3 Cognitive Factors
- **Negative cognitive style** — tendency toward negative interpretations of self, world, and future (Beck's cognitive triad) [1]
- Lack of social confidence, **perfectionist traits** [1]
- ***Cognitive distortions*** prominent in depression (these are targeted in CBT) [3]:
  - ***Selective abstraction 斷章取義***: focusing on a detail and ignoring more important features
  - ***Overgeneralisation 以偏概全***: drawing a general conclusion from a single incident
  - ***Personalisation 過度自責***: relating external events to oneself in an unwarranted way
  - ***Arbitrary inference 妄下判斷***: drawing a conclusion when there is no evidence or even evidence against it

#### 4.3.4 Psychosocial Factors
- **Personally salient adverse life events** can precipitate onset of juvenile depression [1]
  - Events involving ***loss, entrapment, and humiliation*** (e.g., bullying, bereavement, breakup) are especially potent [1][3]
- ***Early environment: parental separation, physical and sexual abuse, non-caring or overprotective parenting styles*** [3]
- ***Lack of supportive networks, poorly functioning relationships, and poor social integration*** [3]
- ***Personality: sociotropy (a strong need for approval), neuroticism*** [3]
  - Sociotropy → "socio" = social, "tropy" = turning toward; these individuals *turn toward* social approval as their source of self-worth, making them vulnerable to rejection
  - Neuroticism → a personality trait characterised by emotional instability, anxiety, and negative affect; it is a shared risk factor for both anxiety and depression [1]

#### 4.3.5 Pubertal Transition

The dramatic increase in depression prevalence after puberty (from < 1% to ~4%) [1] is explained by:
- **Hormonal changes**: rising and fluctuating estrogen and progesterone alter serotonergic transmission
- **Brain reorganisation**: prefrontal pruning and limbic remodelling during adolescence creates a transient period of vulnerability
- **Psychosocial stressors**: academic pressure, peer relationships, identity formation, romantic relationships
- **Gene-environment interaction**: genetic vulnerability (e.g., 5-HTTLPR) may only become manifest when combined with adolescent stressors

### 4.4 Selective Mutism

- **Definition**: consistent failure to speak in specific social situations (e.g., school) where speaking is expected, despite speaking in other situations (e.g., home)
- "Mutism" → "mutus" (Latin) = silent; "selective" = only in certain contexts
- **Not** due to lack of language knowledge or comfort with the spoken language
- Now classified under **anxiety disorders** in DSM-5 (previously under disorders of social functioning in ICD-10)

**Pathophysiology:**
- Conceptualised as an extreme form of **social anxiety** — the child is so anxious about social evaluation that speech is completely inhibited
- The amygdala-based fear response "shuts down" the speech production areas (Broca's area, supplementary motor area) in the presence of perceived social threat
- Often associated with **behavioural inhibition** temperament
- Genetics: family aggregation with social anxiety disorder
- Environmental: may be exacerbated by bilingual environments, immigration, traumatic experiences

### 4.5 Attachment Disorders

These are disorders specifically arising from **pathological caregiving environments**.

#### 4.5.1 Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)
- **Definition**: a pattern of markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate attachment behaviours, characterised by emotionally withdrawn behaviour toward caregivers
- "Reactive" = occurring as a reaction (to pathological care); "attachment" = the bond between child and caregiver
- The child rarely seeks comfort when distressed and rarely responds to comfort when offered
- **Pathophysiology**: the child has not experienced consistent, responsive caregiving → fails to develop a selective attachment → the "internal working model" of relationships (Bowlby's attachment theory) is one of **unreliability and unavailability** → the child gives up seeking comfort
- Associated with **neglect** (insufficient stimulation and affection), frequent changes of primary caregiver (e.g., institutional care)
- HPA axis dysregulation and altered oxytocin/vasopressin signalling

#### 4.5.2 Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED)
- **Definition**: a pattern of indiscriminate sociability — the child approaches and interacts with unfamiliar adults without normal wariness
- **Pathophysiology**: normal "stranger anxiety" (which develops ~8 months) depends on having formed a selective attachment. Without selective attachment, the child never develops the discrimination between "safe" (caregiver) and "potentially unsafe" (stranger) → indiscriminate friendliness
- Same risk factors as RAD (neglect, institutional care, multiple caregiver changes)
- Importantly, DSED can persist even after placement in a stable, nurturing environment — it is more "sticky" than RAD

> In DSM-5, attachment disorders were split into RAD (inhibited type) and DSED (disinhibited type). In ICD-10, these are "reactive attachment disorder of childhood" (F94.1) and "disinhibited attachment disorder of childhood" (F94.2).

### 4.6 Sibling Rivalry Disorder

- **Definition** (ICD-10 F93.3): Abnormally intense negative feelings (jealousy, hostility, aggression) toward a sibling, arising after the birth of a younger sibling, that are **persistent** and **clearly out of the norm** [1]
- Usually manifests as regression (bed-wetting, baby-talk), temper tantrums, aggression toward the new sibling, and attention-seeking behaviour
- **Pathophysiology**: Loss of exclusive parental attention is perceived as a threat to the child's attachment security → anxiety and anger → externalised as rivalry behaviours
- The severity depends on: child's age, temperament, quality of prior attachment, parental handling of the transition

### 4.7 PTSD in Children

- ***PTSD can occur in children and resembles the adult counterpart*** [1], but with important developmental modifications
- Children may not articulate re-experiencing symptoms verbally — instead they show:
  - **Repetitive play** with trauma themes (the child "acts out" the trauma)
  - **Trauma-specific nightmares** (which may become generalised frightening dreams)
  - **Regression** (loss of previously acquired skills, e.g., toilet training)
  - **Behavioural re-enactment** (acting out the trauma in daily behaviour)

**Pathophysiology (shared with adults):**
- ***Traumatic event → overwhelming of normal stress response → failure of fear extinction*** [5]
- Amygdala hyperactivation + hippocampal suppression → emotional memory is "burned in" without proper contextualisation → re-experiencing
- HPA axis dysregulation → chronic hyperarousal
- Prefrontal hypoactivity → failure of top-down emotional regulation → inability to suppress fear response

## 5. Classification

### 5.1 ICD-10 vs DSM-5 Classification of Child Anxiety Disorders

| ICD-10 | DSM-5 Equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **F93 — Emotional disorders with onset specific to childhood** | Classified under **Anxiety Disorders** (not age-specific) | DSM-5 removed the childhood-specific category; anxiety is anxiety regardless of age |
| F93.0 Separation anxiety disorder of childhood | Separation anxiety disorder (can be diagnosed at any age) | DSM-5 allows diagnosis in adults too |
| F93.1 Phobic anxiety disorder of childhood | Specific phobia | |
| F93.2 Social anxiety disorder of childhood | Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) | |
| F93.3 Sibling rivalry disorder | No DSM-5 equivalent | Unique to ICD-10 |
| F93.8 Other childhood emotional disorders | — | Includes identity disorder, overanxious disorder |
| **F94 — Disorders of social functioning with onset specific to childhood** | | |
| F94.0 Selective mutism | Selective mutism (under Anxiety Disorders) | |
| F94.1 Reactive attachment disorder | Reactive attachment disorder (under Trauma-related Disorders) | |
| F94.2 Disinhibited attachment disorder | Disinhibited social engagement disorder (under Trauma-related Disorders) | |

### 5.2 Developmental Staging of Anxiety Content

This is a critical concept — **the neural substrate of anxiety is the same across ages, but the content changes with developmental stage** [1]:

| Developmental Stage | Typical Fear Content | Corresponding Disorder |
|---|---|---|
| **Infants** (0-2 years) | Fear of strangers | → Social anxiety disorder of childhood |
| **Preschool** (3-5 years) | Fear of separation, specific objects (animals, dark) | → Separation anxiety disorder, Phobic anxiety disorder |
| **School age** (6-12 years) | Fear of school performance, injury, natural disasters | → GAD features, specific phobias |
| **Early adolescence** (12-15 years) | Fear of social situations / personal adequacy | → Social phobia |
| **Late adolescence** (16-18 years) | Resembles adult pattern | → GAD, panic disorder |

<Callout title="Why does anxiety content change with age?">
Because the *cognitive* content of anxiety depends on what the child's brain is capable of processing. An infant cannot worry about exam performance because they don't have the concept of "exams." A toddler cannot have panic about bodily sensations because they lack the interoceptive awareness and catastrophic misinterpretation that adults have. As cognitive development progresses, the *themes* of anxiety become more abstract and future-oriented — but the underlying amygdala-based fear response is the same.
</Callout>

### 5.3 Classification of Youth Depression

| Classification | Key Points |
|---|---|
| **ICD-10** | Same diagnostic criteria as adult depression (F32-F33); no separate childhood category |
| **DSM-5** | Same criteria as adult MDD, BUT allows **irritable mood** to substitute for depressed mood in children/adolescents |

<Callout title="Key Exam Point" type="error">
In adults, the core mood symptom of depression is "depressed mood." In children and adolescents, **irritability** can replace depressed mood as the core symptom (DSM-5). This is why many depressed children are initially misdiagnosed as having ODD or ADHD — their irritability and behavioural problems mask the underlying depression.
</Callout>

## 6. Clinical Features — Symptoms and Signs

### 6.1 Anxiety Disorders of Childhood

#### 6.1.1 General Features

**Symptoms** (subjective — what the child/parent reports):

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Excessive worry** (content varies with developmental stage) | Amygdala hyperactivation with insufficient prefrontal regulation → persistent threat appraisal |
| **Somatic complaints** (headaches, abdominal pain, nausea, chest tightness) | Hypothalamic-mediated autonomic activation (sympathetic → GI slowing, muscular tension; vagal → nausea); also overactive insular cortex amplifying interoceptive signals |
| **Sleep disturbance** (difficulty falling asleep, nightmares) | Hyperarousal state maintained by noradrenergic system (locus coeruleus) prevents transition to sleep |
| **Irritability** | Chronic amygdala activation → reduced frustration tolerance; also reflects the child's limited emotional vocabulary — they can't say "I'm anxious" so they express it as anger |
| **Difficulty concentrating** | Anxiety commandeers attentional resources → reduced availability for academic tasks |
| **School refusal** | Avoidance behaviour — the school environment is associated with threat (separation, social evaluation, performance) → conditioned avoidance |

**Signs** (objective — what you observe):

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Clinginess to caregivers** | Activation of attachment system by perceived threat → proximity-seeking behaviour (Bowlby) |
| **Tearfulness / distress on separation** | Amygdala-driven fear response when attachment figure (safety signal) is removed |
| **Psychomotor agitation** (fidgeting, restlessness) | Sympathetic activation → motor tension |
| **Autonomic signs** (tachycardia, sweating, tremor) | Direct sympathetic nervous system activation via hypothalamic-sympathetic pathway |
| **Avoidance behaviours** (refusal to enter feared situations) | Conditioned avoidance — anxiety is negatively reinforced by escape/avoidance (operant conditioning) |
| **Difficulties with peer relationships** [1] | Social withdrawal due to anxiety → reduced social practice → poor social skills → further withdrawal (vicious cycle) |
| **Low self-esteem** [1] | Chronic anxiety → perceived inability to cope → negative self-evaluation |

<Callout title="Atypical Presentations of Childhood Anxiety">
Remember that childhood anxiety may present **atypically** [1]:
- **School refusal** (not to be confused with truancy — the anxious child *wants* to go to school but *can't*)
- **Frequent somatic complaints** (headache, tummy ache → often presents to paediatrics, not psychiatry)
- **Difficulties with peer relationships**
- **Low self-esteem**
- **Irritability and temper tantrums** (the child cannot articulate their anxiety)

The key clinical skill is to ask about these presentations and *think anxiety* when a child has unexplained somatic symptoms or school refusal.
</Callout>

#### 6.1.2 Separation Anxiety Disorder (SAD)

| Feature | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Excessive fear/anxiety about separation from attachment figures** [1] | Overactive attachment/fear system → normal separation protest is amplified and prolonged beyond developmental appropriateness |
| **Anxiety may present with psychosomatic complaints** (abdominal pain, headache, nausea, vomiting — especially on school mornings) [1] | Autonomic activation mediated by hypothalamus → real physical symptoms that the child genuinely experiences |
| **Nightmares about separation** | Threat-related memories processed during sleep → manifest as separation-themed dreams |
| **Refusal to go to school** | School = separation from caregiver; avoidance behaviour reduces anxiety (negative reinforcement) |
| **Refusal to sleep alone** | Darkness + separation = compounded threat → need for proximity to attachment figure |
| **Persistent worry about harm befalling attachment figures** | Catastrophic cognitions (developmental analogue of "worry" in GAD) |
| **Physical complaints (headaches, stomach aches) when separation is anticipated** | Anticipatory anxiety activates the same fear circuits as actual separation |

**Normal vs. pathological**: Separation anxiety is **normal** in infants (peaks 10-18 months). It becomes a **disorder** when:
- It persists beyond the expected developmental period (≥ 4 weeks in children, ≥ 6 months in adults per DSM-5)
- Severity is out of proportion to the developmental stage
- Causes significant distress AND functional impairment

#### 6.1.3 Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)

| Feature | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Intense fear of social situations/scrutiny** | Amygdala hyperreactivity to social-evaluative cues → excessive threat perception in social contexts |
| **Fear of embarrassment or humiliation** | Prefrontal areas involved in self-monitoring are overactive → hyper-awareness of potential negative evaluation |
| **Avoidance of social situations** | Conditioned avoidance |
| **In children: may manifest as crying, freezing, tantrums, clinging, or failing to speak** | Younger children lack the capacity for avoidance planning → more primitive fear responses (freeze, cry) |
| **Selective mutism** (in severe cases) | The anxiety is so intense that it completely inhibits speech output → Broca's area "shut down" by amygdala-mediated fear |

#### 6.1.4 Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

- Primarily seen in **late adolescence** [1]
- Features: excessive, uncontrollable worry about multiple domains (school, health, family, future), muscle tension, restlessness, fatigue, irritability, poor concentration, sleep disturbance
- Pathophysiology: tonic (persistent) overactivity of the amygdala-prefrontal circuit, with failure of prefrontal regulatory mechanisms → "the worry switch can't be turned off"

#### 6.1.5 Panic Disorder

- **Rare before puberty**, primarily seen in **late adolescence** [1]
- Features: recurrent unexpected panic attacks (sudden surge of intense fear with physical symptoms: palpitations, chest pain, dyspnoea, dizziness, paraesthesias, derealization)
- ***Panic response is mediated by amygdala → hypothalamus (dorsomedial hypothalamus/perifornical region coordinates rapid mobilisation of behavioural, autonomic, respiratory and endocrinologic responses to stress)*** [2]
- ***Other structures involved: insula, dorsal ACC, VMPFC*** [2]
- ***Neurotransmitters: 5-HT, NA, GABA are suggested to be related to panic response*** [2]
- ***Neurobiological changes in panic disorder: ↓cortical 5HT1A binding, ↓cortical GABA levels*** [2]

### 6.2 Youth Depression

#### 6.2.1 Adolescent Depression (similar to adult)

| Symptom/Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Depressed mood** (or **irritable mood** in children/adolescents) | ↓5-HT transmission → emotional dysregulation; ↑VMPFC activity → depressive ruminations [1] |
| **Anhedonia** (loss of interest/pleasure) | ↓Dopamine in mesolimbic reward pathway (VTA → nucleus accumbens) |
| **Fatigue / loss of energy** | Monoamine deficiency in RAS → ↓arousal; HPA axis dysfunction → cortisol-related fatigue |
| **Sleep disturbance** (insomnia or hypersomnia) | Dysregulated monoamine-RAS pathway → disrupted sleep-wake cycle; circadian rhythm disruption is common in adolescents |
| **Appetite/weight changes** | Hypothalamic dysregulation (5-HT and NA are involved in appetite regulation) |
| **Poor concentration** | ↓Dorsolateral PFC activity → executive dysfunction [1] |
| **Psychomotor retardation/agitation** | Retardation: ↓DA in frontal-subcortical circuits; Agitation: sympathetic overactivation |
| **Guilt / worthlessness** | Negative cognitive schema (Beck's cognitive triad) |
| **Suicidal ideation** | Severe depression + impulsivity (immature PFC) + hopelessness |

#### 6.2.2 Childhood Depression (atypical features) [1]

In younger children, the clinical picture differs because of developmental immaturity:

| Feature | Why It Differs in Children |
|---|---|
| **Somatic complaints** (unexplained abdominal pain, headache, anorexia, enuresis) [1] | Children lack the metacognitive vocabulary for "I feel sad" → distress is expressed somatically through autonomic pathways |
| **Irritable mood** (rather than sadness) [1] | Developing prefrontal cortex cannot modulate negative affect into "sadness" → instead manifests as low frustration tolerance/irritability |
| **Anxiety features** [1] | High comorbidity (70% have anxiety disorder) [1]; shared neurobiological vulnerability (5-HT, HPA axis) |
| **Behavioural problems** [1] | Depression → frustration, anger → externalising behaviours; examples from notes: "one case tried to steal a bus because of frustration at home, take cannabis to lift mood due to depression" [1] |
| **School refusal** | Anhedonia + fatigue + low self-esteem → avoidance of school demands |
| **Regression** (bedwetting, baby talk) | Stress-induced regression to earlier developmental stage |

#### 6.2.3 Comorbidities

- **70% have comorbid anxiety disorder** [1]
- Conduct disorder (CD)
- Substance abuse (SA)
- Dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder)

<Callout title="Critical Point: Bipolar Masked as Depression">
**~25% of bipolar affective disorder (BAD) first presents as a juvenile depressive episode** [1]. This means that when you see an adolescent with depression, you should ALWAYS screen for:
- Family history of bipolar disorder
- History of any hypomanic/manic symptoms
- Rapid cycling or seasonal pattern
- Psychotic features (more suggestive of bipolar)
- Marked atypical features (hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis)

This is critical because treating bipolar depression with antidepressants alone (without a mood stabiliser) can trigger mania.
</Callout>

### 6.3 Selective Mutism

| Feature | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations** (e.g., school) despite speaking normally at home | Amygdala-mediated social anxiety → speech production areas are inhibited in perceived threatening social contexts |
| **Normal language development** (speaks fluently at home) | This is NOT a language disorder — the speech apparatus and language centres are intact |
| **May communicate with gestures, nodding, or writing** | The child finds alternative channels to bypass the speech "block" |
| **Onset typically before age 5** | Coincides with entry into kindergarten/school (first major social context outside family) |
| **Duration > 1 month** (not limited to the first month of school) | DSM-5 criterion to distinguish from normal adjustment |
| **Social withdrawal, clinginess** | Associated anxiety behaviours |

### 6.4 Attachment Disorders

#### Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)

| Feature | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Emotionally withdrawn behaviour toward caregivers** | Absent or inconsistent caregiving → child learns that seeking comfort is futile → attachment system "shuts down" |
| **Minimal seeking of comfort when distressed** | No "safe base" was established → child does not expect comfort to be available |
| **Minimal response to comfort offered** | The child has not learned that caregiver contact reduces distress |
| **Reduced positive affect** | Chronic deprivation → blunted reward/attachment circuitry (oxytocin, vasopressin pathways) |
| **Episodes of unexplained irritability or sadness** | Emotional dysregulation without the soothing function of secure attachment |

#### Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED)

| Feature | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Indiscriminate social approach to unfamiliar adults** | Failure to develop selective attachment → no "stranger anxiety" → everyone is treated as equivalent |
| **No checking back with caregiver in unfamiliar settings** | No "safe base" → no need to reference caregiver for safety cues |
| **Willingness to leave with unfamiliar adults** | Absent stranger wariness → potential safety risk |
| **Overly familiar verbal/physical behaviour with strangers** | Social approach system is activated without the normal inhibition from the attachment-mediated "discrimination" system |

### 6.5 PTSD in Children

| Feature | Developmental Modification | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Re-experiencing** | In young children: **repetitive play** with trauma themes, **trauma-specific nightmares** (may become generalised) | Amygdala-encoded fear memory intrudes into consciousness; play = attempt to master the traumatic experience |
| **Avoidance** | May be less obvious; shown as avoidance of trauma-related activities, places, or people | Conditioned avoidance — same as adults |
| **Negative cognitions/mood** | May manifest as **regression**, **loss of developmental skills**, withdrawn behaviour | Hippocampal suppression → poor contextualisation of trauma; prefrontal hypoactivity → emotional dysregulation |
| **Hyperarousal** | Sleep disturbance, **exaggerated startle**, **irritability/temper tantrums**, concentration difficulties | Chronic noradrenergic hyperactivation (locus coeruleus) → persistent "fight-or-flight" state |

***PTSD can occur in children and resembles the adult counterpart*** [1], but the developmental modifications listed above are critical for diagnosis.

<Callout title="Stress-Related Disorders in Children — From the Lecture" type="idea">
The lecture on stress-related disorders [5] emphasises that:
- ***PTSD requires exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence***
- ***Children < 6 years have a separate set of criteria in DSM-5*** (more behaviourally based, fewer symptoms required)
- ***Acute stress disorder*** (3 days to 1 month) and ***adjustment disorder*** (within 3 months of stressor, < 6 months after stressor ends) are important differentials
- ***Risk factors include: pre-existing psychiatric illness, poor social support, severity and duration of trauma, peritraumatic dissociation***

### 6.6 Sibling Rivalry Disorder

| Feature | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Extreme jealousy toward sibling** (persistent, clearly out of norm) [1] | Perceived loss of exclusive parental attention → threat to attachment security → anger and fear |
| **Regression** (baby-like behaviour: bed-wetting, thumb-sucking, baby talk) | Unconscious attempt to recapture the parental attention given to the "baby" |
| **Aggression toward the sibling** (hitting, biting, deliberate harm) | Anger at the perceived "rival" for parental affection |
| **Attention-seeking behaviour** (temper tantrums, acting out) | Direct bid for parental attention |
| **Sleep disturbance, appetite changes** | Anxiety and distress → autonomic and behavioural disruption |

## 7. Diagnosis: Key Principle

> **Anxiety and fears CAN be developmentally appropriate** [1]. A disorder is only diagnosed when:
> 1. Symptoms are **developmentally inappropriate** (more severe and prolonged than usual)
> 2. They cause **significant distress**
> 3. They cause **functional impairment** (academic, social, family functioning)

### Differential Diagnosis Considerations (to be expanded in next section)

- **Organic causes** must always be considered: hyperthyroidism, arrhythmias, neurological disease, substance-induced anxiety (alcohol, illicit drugs, caffeine) [1]
- For depression: thyroid dysfunction, Addison's disease, anaemia, medication-related (corticosteroids), substance use
- Normal developmental fears vs. pathological anxiety
- Other psychiatric disorders (ADHD, ODD, CD — all can present with irritability and concentration difficulties)

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Anxiety Disorders in Children:**
- **Commonest** psychiatric disorder of childhood
- Content of anxiety varies by developmental stage: strangers (infancy) → separation/specific objects (preschool) → social evaluation (early adolescence) → resembles adult (late adolescence)
- Aetiology: dysregulated 5-HT/NA + overactive BIS + behavioural inhibition temperament + anxious attachment + cognitive biases
- Atypical presentations: school refusal, somatic complaints, peer difficulties, low self-esteem, irritability
- Diagnosis: only when developmentally inappropriate + distress + functional impairment
- Management: CBT (1st line) > SSRIs (severe cases)
- Prognosis: ~2/3 resolve in 3-5 years but ~1/3 develop other anxiety disorders

**Youth Depression:**
- Rare pre-puberty (< 1%), rises dramatically post-puberty (~4%)
- Adolescent depression ≈ adult depression
- Childhood depression is more: somatic complaints, irritable mood, behavioural problems, anxiety
- 70% have comorbid anxiety; ~25% of BAD first presents as juvenile depression
- Aetiology: 5-HTTLPR × adversity, cortisol → hippocampal atrophy → ↓5-HT, cognitive distortions
- Management: antidepressants (SSRIs) for moderate-severe + CBT; **beware suicidal risk with SSRIs**
- Prognosis: episodic relapsing; majority recover < 3 months but 15% last > 18 months

**Selective Mutism:** Extreme social anxiety → speech inhibition in specific social contexts; normal speech at home

**Attachment Disorders:** RAD (inhibited — emotionally withdrawn) vs DSED (disinhibited — indiscriminate sociability); arise from pathological caregiving (neglect, institutional care)

**PTSD in Children:** Resembles adult PTSD but with repetitive play, trauma-specific nightmares, regression, behavioural re-enactment

**Sibling Rivalry Disorder:** Persistent, abnormally intense jealousy/hostility toward sibling after birth of new sibling; ICD-10 specific

      question: "What is the commonest psychiatric disorder of childhood, and how does its content change with developmental stage?",
      markscheme: "Anxiety disorders are the commonest. Content changes: Infants = fear of strangers; Preschool = separation, specific objects; Early adolescence = social evaluation/personal adequacy; Late adolescence = resembles adult (GAD, panic). Same underlying amygdala-based circuit, different cognitive content."
    },
    {
      question: "Name three criteria that distinguish a pathological anxiety disorder from a normal developmental fear in a child.",
      markscheme: "1) Developmentally inappropriate (more severe and prolonged than expected for the age), 2) Causes significant distress, 3) Causes functional impairment (academic, social, or family). All three must be present."
    },
    {
      question: "How does childhood depression differ from adolescent/adult depression in terms of clinical presentation?",
      markscheme: "Childhood depression shows more: somatic complaints (abdominal pain, headache, enuresis), irritable mood (rather than sadness), behavioural problems (externalising), anxiety features. Adolescent depression is largely similar to adult depression. DSM-5 allows irritable mood to substitute for depressed mood in children."
    },
    {
      question: "What proportion of bipolar affective disorder first presents as a juvenile depressive episode, and why is this clinically important?",
      markscheme: "Approximately 25%. Clinically important because treating bipolar depression with antidepressants alone (without mood stabiliser) can trigger mania or rapid cycling. Must always screen for FHx of bipolar, any hypomanic symptoms, and psychotic features."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain the neurobiological mechanism linking early life adversity to youth depression (the cortisol-hippocampus-serotonin pathway).",
      markscheme: "Early adversity causes chronic HPA axis activation and cortisol elevation. Hippocampus is rich in glucocorticoid receptors so chronic cortisol causes hippocampal atrophy. Hippocampal atrophy leads to decreased serotonin neurotransmission and impaired negative feedback on HPA axis, perpetuating a vicious cycle of cortisol excess and monoamine deficiency."
    },
    {
      question: "Differentiate Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) from Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED) in terms of clinical features and prognosis.",
      markscheme: "RAD: emotionally withdrawn, rarely seeks or responds to comfort, reduced positive affect. DSED: indiscriminate sociability, approaches unfamiliar adults without wariness, no checking back with caregiver. Both arise from pathological caregiving (neglect, institutional care). DSED tends to persist even after placement in stable environment, while RAD may improve with consistent caregiving."
