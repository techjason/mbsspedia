## Complications of Schizophrenia and Related Disorders

Complications of schizophrenia can be broadly divided into those arising from **the disease itself**, those arising from its **treatment** (iatrogenic), and those arising from the **interaction between disease, treatment, and social context**. Understanding these complications from first principles — connecting each back to pathophysiology or pharmacology — is essential.

---

### 1. Complications of the Disease Itself

#### 1A. Suicide

***Suicide is the single largest cause of premature death in schizophrenia*** [1]

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| ***Lifetime suicide risk*** | ***5.6% (based on first-episode cohorts), 4.9% (from all studies)*** [1] |
| ***When is risk highest?*** | ***Risk is highest in the early stage of psychotic disorders. Rate is highest in the first year after presentation of FEP (first-episode psychosis)*** [1] |
| ***Relative risk*** | ***Suicide risk of psychotic patients is 12 times more than expected from general population*** [1] |
| ***Key predictor*** | ***Depressed mood, one of the strongest predictor of suicide, is frequently observed in the early stage of illness*** [1] |

> **Why is the first year after FEP the highest risk period?** Several factors converge: (1) the patient is often an intelligent young person who develops insight into the devastating nature of their diagnosis — this "insight–despair paradox" is a powerful driver of hopelessness; (2) depressive symptoms are extremely common in early psychosis; (3) command auditory hallucinations may instruct self-harm; (4) the transition from acute treatment to community care is a vulnerable period with potential loss of support [2].

**Additional suicide risk factors specific to schizophrenia:**
- Young age, male sex
- Good premorbid functioning (more to lose → greater perceived loss)
- High education level
- Early illness course (especially first 1–5 years)
- Comorbid depression (present in ~25% — post-schizophrenia depression [2])
- Comorbid substance abuse
- Command hallucinations
- Previous suicide attempts
- Recent hospital discharge
- Social isolation, loss of role/employment
- Poor adherence → relapse → crisis

<Callout title="The Insight–Despair Paradox" type="error">
Counterintuitively, **better insight** into the illness is associated with **higher suicide risk** in schizophrenia. This is the opposite of what you might expect. The patient who recognises they have a chronic psychotic illness, who understands the implications for their career, relationships, and independence, may experience profound hopelessness. This is why recovery-oriented approaches and hope-instilling therapeutic relationships are so important alongside medical treatment.

#### 1B. Excess Mortality from Physical Illness

***Excess mortality in schizophrenia patients*** [1]:
- ***Schizophrenia reduces an affected individual's lifespan by on average 10–15 years*** [1]
- ***All-cause standardised mortality ratio (SMR): 2 to 3*** [1]
- ***SMR of schizophrenia: 2.5, shortened life expectancy: 8–10 years in Hong Kong (Yung et al. 2021)*** [1]
- ***Elevated both in suicide and natural deaths*** [1]
- ***Increased risk of premature deaths related to a wide range of physical illnesses*** [1]

***Possible reasons for elevated rate of natural deaths*** [1]:

| Reason | Mechanism | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| ***Lifestyle (sedentary lifestyle, lack of exercise, poor nutrition)*** [1] | Negative symptoms (avolition, apathy) → reduced motivation for exercise and self-care; cognitive impairment → difficulty planning meals; poverty → poor dietary choices | Obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes |
| ***Cigarette smoking*** [1] | Extremely prevalent in schizophrenia (~60–80% vs ~20% general population). Why? Nicotine partially normalises sensory gating deficits (P50 suppression) and provides transient cognitive enhancement; may also reduce antipsychotic side effects (EPS) via nicotinic receptor stimulation. It is essentially a form of "self-medication" | Lung cancer, COPD, cardiovascular disease |
| ***Substance or alcohol abuse*** [1] | ***Schizophrenia: 30% abuse alcohol*** [5]. Alcohol may decrease feeling of isolation and temporarily reduce symptoms of anxiety/depression/insomnia — but ***increases psychotic symptoms and mood swings***, causes ***disruptive behaviour, suicide, treatment non-compliance, drug abuse, poor clinical outcome*** [5]. Also: ***drug accumulation due to hepatic damage*** [5] | Liver disease, pancreatitis, cardiomyopathy, infections, worsened psychosis |
| ***Metabolic syndrome (obesity, DM, hyperlipidaemia etc.)*** [1] | Both from disease-inherent metabolic dysregulation AND iatrogenic from second-generation antipsychotics (see Section 2 below) | Cardiovascular disease — the leading cause of death in schizophrenia |
| ***Second-generation antipsychotic*** [1] | H1 antagonism → weight gain; insulin resistance → diabetes; dyslipidaemia | Metabolic syndrome → cardiovascular mortality |
| ***Inherent disease process involving accelerated aging and medical morbidity*** [1] | Emerging evidence of accelerated biological aging (telomere shortening, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation) inherent to the disorder itself, independent of lifestyle and medication | Premature cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and metabolic disease |

> **Why is cardiovascular disease the biggest killer in schizophrenia?** It is the perfect storm: intrinsic metabolic dysregulation + antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome + cigarette smoking + sedentary lifestyle + poor nutrition + substance abuse + poor access to healthcare (patients may not report symptoms, may not be taken seriously in medical settings ["diagnostic overshadowing"], and may struggle to navigate healthcare systems). Each factor alone increases cardiovascular risk; together, they are devastating.

#### 1C. Functional Impairment and Disability

***The conditions cause profound disruptions in individuals' personality development, social relationships, scholastic and vocational trajectories*** [1]

***Potentially chronic, remitting-relapse course, with significant functional impairment*** [1]

| Domain | Nature of Impairment | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Occupational** | Most patients unable to maintain competitive employment (unemployment rates 70–90%); reduced productivity | Cognitive impairment (executive function, processing speed) + negative symptoms (avolition) + positive symptoms during relapse + stigma |
| **Educational** | Illness onset in late adolescence/early adulthood disrupts education at a critical formational period | Onset during peak educational years → failure to achieve expected qualifications |
| **Social/Interpersonal** | Social isolation, breakdown of relationships, difficulty forming new connections | Asociality (negative symptom) + paranoid delusions → withdrawal; impaired social cognition (Theory of Mind deficits → inability to read others' intentions and emotions) [1] |
| **Self-care** | Poor hygiene, poor nutrition, inability to manage finances or housing | Avolition + cognitive impairment → inability to plan and execute daily living activities |
| **Caregiver burden** | Significant psychological, financial, and social burden on families | Chronic course, high expressed emotion, need for supervision, stigma |

> ***Cognitive impairment is a core feature in schizophrenia***, ***a key determinant of functional outcome***, and represents an ***unmet therapeutic need, not responsive to antipsychotic treatment*** [1]. This means that even when positive symptoms are well-controlled, patients may remain functionally disabled due to persistent cognitive deficits. This is why cognitive remediation and psychosocial rehabilitation are critical complements to medication.

#### 1D. Comorbid Psychiatric Disorders

| Comorbidity | Prevalence | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **Depression** | ~25% develop post-schizophrenia depression [2]; depressive symptoms common throughout illness course | Strongest predictor of suicide; contributes to functional impairment; often mistaken for negative symptoms |
| **Substance use disorders** | ~50% comorbid (tobacco ~70%, cannabis ~25%, alcohol ~30% [5]) | Worsens psychosis, increases non-adherence, increases violence risk, increases medical morbidity, reduces treatment efficacy |
| **Anxiety disorders** | ~30–40% | Reduces quality of life; often under-recognised and under-treated |
| **OCD** | ~12% (much higher than general population ~2%) | May be partly iatrogenic (clozapine can induce/worsen OCD via 5-HT2A/2C antagonism) |

#### 1E. Violence and Aggression

- Patients with schizophrenia have a modestly increased risk of violence compared to the general population, but this is **largely mediated by comorbid substance abuse** — patients without substance abuse have only marginally elevated risk
- Risk factors: active positive symptoms (persecutory delusions, command hallucinations), substance abuse, non-adherence, history of violence
- **Important context:** Patients with schizophrenia are far more likely to be **victims** of violence and exploitation than perpetrators. Stigma from exaggerated media portrayal of violence in schizophrenia is one of the most damaging barriers to care

#### 1F. Catatonia and Malignant Catatonia

Catatonia can occur as a complication of schizophrenia itself (discussed in the clinical features section). **Malignant catatonia** — characterised by fever, autonomic instability, rigidity, and delirium — is a medical emergency with significant mortality if untreated. Treatment is with benzodiazepines (first-line) and/or ECT [2].

---

### 2. Complications of Treatment (Iatrogenic)

#### 2A. Antipsychotic Side Effects

These are among the most important complications to know — they directly affect adherence, morbidity, and mortality.

##### Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)

EPS result from D2 receptor blockade in the **nigrostriatal pathway**, disrupting the balance of the basal ganglia motor circuits.

| Type | Onset | Clinical Features | Mechanism | Treatment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Acute dystonia** | Hours to days | Sustained involuntary muscle contractions: torticollis, oculogyric crisis, trismus, laryngospasm (can be life-threatening) | Acute D2 blockade in striatum → cholinergic predominance → muscle spasm | IM anticholinergic (benztropine/procyclidine) — rapid response |
| **Akathisia** | Days to weeks | Subjective inner restlessness, inability to sit still, pacing; intensely distressing; associated with increased suicide risk | Not fully understood; may involve D2 blockade in mesocortical pathway or serotonergic mechanisms | Reduce dose; switch to lower-EPS agent; propranolol (beta-blocker); benzodiazepine |
| **Drug-induced parkinsonism** | Weeks to months | Bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, shuffling gait, masked facies | D2 blockade in nigrostriatal pathway → dopamine–acetylcholine imbalance in striatum (same mechanism as idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but reversible) | Reduce dose; add anticholinergic (procyclidine); switch to lower-EPS agent |
| **Tardive dyskinesia (TD)** | Months to years | Involuntary repetitive movements, especially orofacial (lip smacking, tongue protrusion, chewing); may be irreversible | Chronic D2 blockade → compensatory D2 receptor upregulation and supersensitivity → abnormal involuntary movements when blockade is even slightly reduced | Prevention is key (use lowest effective dose, prefer SGAs). Treatment: valbenazine, deutetrabenazine (VMAT2 inhibitors); switch to clozapine (lowest TD risk) |

> **Why does tardive dyskinesia occur late while parkinsonism occurs early?** Parkinsonism is the direct result of D2 blockade (immediate pharmacological effect). TD, by contrast, is a **compensatory adaptation** — the brain responds to chronic D2 blockade by upregulating and sensitising D2 receptors. Over months–years, this leads to a state of dopaminergic **supersensitivity** in the nigrostriatal pathway, causing involuntary movements. This is why TD can paradoxically worsen if antipsychotics are abruptly stopped (unmasking the supersensitive receptors).

##### Metabolic Syndrome

The most clinically significant long-term complication of second-generation antipsychotics:

| Component | Mechanism | Clinical Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Weight gain** | H1 receptor antagonism (appetite stimulation); 5-HT2C antagonism; effects on leptin signalling | Obesity → cardiovascular risk, disability, non-adherence |
| **Type 2 diabetes** | Insulin resistance (mechanism not fully understood — direct effect on pancreatic β-cells, adipocyte dysfunction) | Diabetic complications; cardiovascular mortality |
| **Dyslipidaemia** | Elevated triglycerides, elevated LDL, reduced HDL | Atherosclerosis → MI, stroke |
| **Hypertension** | Weight gain → metabolic syndrome component | Cardiovascular risk |

Worst offenders: **clozapine** and **olanzapine** (both +++). Aripiprazole, lurasidone, and ziprasidone are relatively metabolically neutral.

> ***Metabolic syndrome related to 2nd generation antipsychotics*** is one of the key reasons for the excess mortality in schizophrenia [1][2]. This is why baseline and regular metabolic monitoring (weight, BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, lipids, blood pressure) is mandatory for every patient on antipsychotics.

##### Hyperprolactinaemia

- Mechanism: D2 blockade in the **tuberoinfundibular pathway** removes the tonic dopamine inhibition of prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary [2]
- **Consequences:** Galactorrhoea, amenorrhoea (in women), sexual dysfunction (both sexes), gynaecomastia (in men), **osteoporosis** (long-term — due to hypogonadism from prolactin-mediated suppression of GnRH)
- Worst offenders: risperidone, paliperidone, amisulpride, sulpiride (all have strong D2 binding but relatively poor blood–brain barrier penetration at tuberoinfundibular level OR particularly potent D2 affinity)
- Minimal/no effect: clozapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole (partial D2 agonist — may actually lower prolactin)

##### QTc Prolongation

- Mechanism: Blockade of cardiac hERG (IKr) potassium channels → delayed ventricular repolarisation → prolonged QTc interval → risk of torsades de pointes → ventricular fibrillation → sudden cardiac death
- Highest risk: haloperidol (IV > IM > oral), amisulpride, ziprasidone
- Monitoring: baseline ECG before starting antipsychotics; repeat if clinically indicated; QTc > 500ms or increase > 60ms → stop or switch drug

##### Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | Life-threatening idiosyncratic reaction to antipsychotic medication (or rapid withdrawal of dopaminergic agents) |
| **Mechanism** | Severe, acute D2 blockade in the hypothalamus (thermoregulatory centre) and nigrostriatal pathway → autonomic dysfunction + muscle rigidity |
| **Clinical features** | **Tetrad:** (1) Hyperthermia (> 38°C, often > 40°C); (2) Lead-pipe rigidity; (3) Autonomic instability (labile BP, tachycardia, diaphoresis); (4) Altered consciousness (confusion → coma) |
| **Lab findings** | Markedly elevated CK (rhabdomyolysis from sustained rigidity), leucocytosis, elevated LFTs, metabolic acidosis, myoglobinuria |
| **Risk factors** | High-potency FGAs (haloperidol), rapid dose escalation, IM injection, dehydration, exhaustion, prior NMS episode |
| **Management** | STOP antipsychotic immediately; supportive care (cooling, IV fluids, cardiovascular support); dantrolene (skeletal muscle relaxant — reduces rigidity and heat production); bromocriptine (dopamine agonist — counteracts D2 blockade); consider ICU transfer |
| **Mortality** | 5–20% even with treatment; higher with delayed recognition |
| **Differential** | Malignant catatonia (can look identical — key difference is context: NMS occurs after antipsychotic initiation/dose increase; malignant catatonia occurs in untreated psychosis), serotonin syndrome, malignant hyperthermia |

> **Why does NMS cause hyperthermia?** The hypothalamus is the body's thermostat. It uses dopaminergic signalling to regulate temperature. Severe D2 blockade in the hypothalamus disrupts this regulation → loss of heat dissipation + sustained muscle rigidity (nigrostriatal D2 blockade) generates enormous heat → dangerous hyperthermia. Rhabdomyolysis from the rigidity releases myoglobin → renal failure (a common cause of death).

##### Clozapine-Specific Complications

(Detailed in the management section; summarised here for completeness)

| Complication | Incidence | Mechanism | Monitoring/Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Agranulocytosis** | ~1–2%; highest risk in first 18 weeks | Idiosyncratic immune-mediated granulocyte destruction | Mandatory neutrophil monitoring (weekly × 18w, fortnightly to 1y, monthly thereafter). Stop immediately if neutrophils < 1.5 × 10⁹/L |
| **Myocarditis / Cardiomyopathy** | ~1–3% for myocarditis; rare for cardiomyopathy | Likely IgE-mediated hypersensitivity (myocarditis) or direct toxic effect (cardiomyopathy) | Baseline and periodic ECG/echocardiography; troponin/CRP if symptoms develop. Highest risk in first months |
| **Seizures** | Dose-related (risk increases > 600mg/day) | Lowers seizure threshold | Consider prophylactic valproate at high doses |
| **Constipation / Ileus** | Very common; can be fatal | Antimuscarinic (M1) effects → reduced gut motility → faecal impaction → bowel obstruction/perforation | Proactive bowel regimen; regular monitoring; avoid concurrent anticholinergics |
| **Pulmonary embolism** | Increased risk | Multifactorial: sedation + obesity + immobility + possible direct pro-coagulant effect | Encourage mobilisation; be vigilant for PE symptoms |
| **Sialorrhoea (drooling)** | Very common (~30–80%) | Paradoxical: M4 muscarinic partial agonism (despite being antimuscarinic at M1) | Hyoscine patches, ipratropium sublingual, glycopyrrolate |

#### 2B. Complications of ECT

- **Cognitive:** Acute post-ictal confusion; anterograde and retrograde amnesia (generally short-lived, days to weeks; bilateral > unilateral placement)
- **Medical:** Headache, nausea, muscle pain; rare cardiac arrhythmias; extremely rare aspiration
- **Mortality:** 2–4 per 100,000 (comparable to minor surgery under GA)

### 3. Complications from the Interaction of Disease, Treatment, and Social Context

#### 3A. Stigma and Discrimination

- ***Schizophrenia and related psychoses account for substantial direct and indirect costs to the society*** [1]:
  - ***Direct costs: hospitalisation, medication costs etc.*** [1]
  - ***Indirect costs: loss of productivity in patients and their caregivers, disability allowance etc.*** [1]
- The name "schizophrenia" itself carries immense stigma — many Asian countries (including Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong) have renamed or discussed renaming the disorder (Japan changed to "integration disorder" in 2002)
- Stigma leads to: delayed help-seeking, social exclusion, housing discrimination, employment discrimination, "diagnostic overshadowing" (physical symptoms dismissed as psychiatric), and internalised shame

#### 3B. Treatment Non-Adherence → Relapse Cycle

***High risk of relapse*** [1]. ***Major risk factor of relapse: non-adherence to medication*** [1].

Non-adherence (up to 52% [2]) creates a vicious cycle:

```
Non-adherence → relapse → hospitalisation → medication restarted → side effects → poor adherence → relapse...
```

Each relapse carries risk of:
- Incomplete recovery (the "scar" effect — each episode may leave behind increasing residual deficit)
- Progressive functional decline
- Progressive structural brain changes (grey matter loss) — it is postulated that active psychosis is neurotoxic and delayed treatment leads to irreversible neurological deterioration [2]
- Increased suicide risk during acute relapse
- Social consequences (loss of employment, relationships, housing)

#### 3C. Homelessness and Legal Consequences

- Patients with chronic schizophrenia are overrepresented in homeless populations and the criminal justice system
- This reflects the combination of functional impairment, substance abuse, medication non-adherence, inadequate community mental health services, and stigma

#### 3D. Impact on Caregivers

- **Expressed emotion (EE)** — critical, hostile, or emotionally over-involved attitudes from family — is both a complication (resulting from caregiver burnout) and a perpetuating factor (increasing relapse risk if EE exposure > 35h/week) [2]
- Caregivers experience increased rates of depression, anxiety, social isolation, financial hardship, and physical health problems
- Family intervention (psychoeducation, support groups, EE reduction) directly addresses this

### Summary: Complications by Category

| Category | Key Complications |
|---|---|
| **Disease-related** | Suicide (5.6% lifetime; 12× general population; highest in first year of FEP); excess physical morbidity and mortality (lifespan reduced 10–15 years; SMR 2.5); functional impairment (occupational, educational, social, self-care); comorbid psychiatric disorders (depression, substance abuse, anxiety, OCD); violence risk (largely substance-mediated); catatonia / malignant catatonia |
| **Treatment-related** | EPS (acute dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia); metabolic syndrome (weight gain, diabetes, dyslipidaemia — especially olanzapine, clozapine); hyperprolactinaemia (especially risperidone, amisulpride); QTc prolongation (torsades de pointes risk); NMS (life-threatening); clozapine-specific (agranulocytosis, myocarditis, seizures, constipation/ileus, PE) |
| **Disease–Treatment–Society interaction** | Stigma and discrimination; non-adherence → relapse cycle → progressive decline; homelessness; caregiver burden and high expressed emotion |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Suicide:** Single largest cause of premature death. Lifetime risk 5.6%. Highest in first year after FEP. Depressed mood is the strongest predictor. Paradoxically, better insight may increase risk.

**Excess Mortality:** Lifespan reduced 10–15 years (SMR 2.5 in HK). Majority from natural causes, especially cardiovascular disease. Driven by lifestyle, smoking, substance abuse, metabolic syndrome from SGAs, and possibly inherent accelerated aging.

**Metabolic Syndrome:** The most clinically significant long-term treatment complication. Olanzapine and clozapine are worst offenders. Mandatory baseline and regular metabolic monitoring for all patients on antipsychotics.

**EPS:** Acute dystonia (hours–days), akathisia (days–weeks), parkinsonism (weeks–months), tardive dyskinesia (months–years, potentially irreversible). All from nigrostriatal D2 blockade. TD is from compensatory receptor upregulation/supersensitivity.

**NMS:** Life-threatening emergency. Tetrad: hyperthermia, rigidity, autonomic instability, altered consciousness. Stop antipsychotic, give dantrolene + bromocriptine, supportive ICU care.

**Clozapine:** Agranulocytosis (mandatory neutrophil monitoring), myocarditis, seizures, severe constipation/ileus, PE.

**Functional Impairment:** Cognitive impairment is the key determinant of functional outcome and represents an unmet therapeutic need (not responsive to antipsychotics). Even when positive symptoms are controlled, patients may remain disabled.

**Non-adherence:** Up to 52%, the major risk factor for relapse. Each relapse risks incomplete recovery and progressive decline.

**Comorbid Substance Abuse:** 30% abuse alcohol. Temporarily reduces isolation/anxiety but worsens psychosis, mood, non-compliance, and overall outcome.
