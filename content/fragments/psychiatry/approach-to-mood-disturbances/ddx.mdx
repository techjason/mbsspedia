## Differential Diagnosis of Mood Disturbances

The differential diagnosis of mood disturbances is best approached by considering two separate but overlapping clinical presentations: **low mood** and **elated/irritable mood**. In practice, you encounter a patient and must work through a systematic list — "Is this a primary mood disorder, another psychiatric condition mimicking a mood disorder, a secondary (medical/substance) cause, or a normal reaction?" This section walks through that logic from first principles.

---

### Guiding Principle: The Diagnostic Hierarchy

Before diving into the lists, understand *why* we think in a hierarchy. Psychiatry has traditionally prioritised **organic (medical) causes first**, because they are the most dangerous to miss and the most treatable with specific interventions. Then we consider substance-induced causes (remove the substance, the "mood disorder" resolves). Only after excluding these do we land on primary psychiatric diagnoses.

### A. Differential Diagnosis of Low Mood

This is the approach when a patient presents with depressed mood, anhedonia, or anergia as the chief complaint [3].

#### 1. Primary Mood Disorders

| Diagnosis | Salient Differentiating Features |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)** | Current depressive episode (meeting full criteria) lasting ≥ 2 weeks. Graded as mild, moderate, severe, or severe with psychotic features. If ≥ 1 previous episodes → *recurrent depressive disorder* [3] |
| **Bipolar Affective Disorder (depressive phase)** | Current depressive episode + ≥ 1 previous manic or hypomanic episode. Key: always ask about past elation/irritability! Clues to bipolar depression: younger onset, atypical features (hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis), psychotic features, family history of bipolar, poor antidepressant response [3][5] |
| **Dysthymia (Persistent Depressive Disorder)** | Current symptoms NOT meeting full depressive episode criteria, lasting ≥ 2 years. Insidious onset in early adulthood, persistent low mood without distinct episodes. May have superimposed depressive episodes ("double depression") — importantly, this does NOT rule out a concurrent MDD diagnosis [3] |
| **Cyclothymia** | Numerous minor depressive and mild elative mood episodes (neither meeting hypomanic nor depressive episode criteria), lasting ≥ 2 years. Think of it as a "low-grade" bipolar spectrum [3] |

<Callout title="Why Ask About Past Hypomania in Every Depressed Patient?" type="idea">
Approximately 10-20% of patients initially diagnosed with MDD are later reclassified as bipolar disorder. Hypomanic episodes are often missed because patients experience them as feeling "normal" or even "good" — they don't complain about feeling great! Always take collateral history and use screening tools like the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) or Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32). Misdiagnosis leads to antidepressant monotherapy, which can trigger manic switch and accelerate cycling [3].
</Callout>

#### 2. Other Psychiatric Conditions Mimicking Depression

| Diagnosis | Why It Mimics Depression | How to Differentiate |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| ***Adjustment disorder with depressed mood*** [6] | Develops in response to an identifiable stressor; emotional or behavioural symptoms including low mood, tearfulness, hopelessness | Develops ≤ 3 months of the stressor; does not meet full criteria for MDD; symptoms are disproportionate to the stressor but resolve once the stressor (or its consequences) has terminated. The mood disturbance is clearly "disorder vs. normal reaction" but insufficient for a specific mood/anxiety disorder diagnosis [5] |
| ***Anxiety disorder*** [6] | Anxiety and depression frequently co-exist; patients with GAD can appear low in mood, fatigued, with poor concentration | In GAD, the core feature is *excessive worry about future events*; in depression, the patient ruminates on *past failures and worthlessness*. Look for: early morning wakening, diurnal variation, suicidal thoughts (uncommon in pure GAD). Note that GAD + depression can genuinely co-exist [5] |
| **Schizophrenia / Schizoaffective disorder** | Negative symptoms (avolition, flat affect, social withdrawal) can closely mimic depression | In schizophrenia, look for mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms persisting outside mood episodes; formal thought disorder (loosening of associations vs. psychomotor retardation); negative symptoms are typically more enduring and less episodic than depressive episodes [3] |
| **Personality disorders (e.g., Borderline PD)** | Chronic feelings of emptiness, mood instability, self-harm can mimic chronic depression | Mood shifts are rapid (hours to days, not weeks), often triggered by interpersonal events; identity disturbance, intense unstable relationships, fear of abandonment are present; pattern is enduring (not episodic) [5] |
| **Dementia** | Apathy, social withdrawal, cognitive decline can mimic depression. Conversely, depression in the elderly can present as "pseudodementia" | Depression: onset more well-defined with rapid decline, patients *complain* of poor memory (vs. dementia patients who lack insight and are brought by family), give less effort on cognitive testing; language and motor skills are slow but not structurally impaired. Always consider treating depression before concluding dementia [5] |
| **Grief / Bereavement** | Normal grief can include profound sadness, insomnia, poor appetite, weight loss | DSM-5 removed the "bereavement exclusion" — grief CAN co-exist with or trigger MDD. Normal grief: waves of sadness mixed with positive memories; self-esteem preserved; thoughts of death relate to "joining" the deceased. MDD: pervasive depressed mood; worthlessness, guilt not related to the deceased; suicidal ideation about own worthlessness [6] |

> ***Key DSM-5 change: Removal of the "bereavement exclusion" — depressive symptoms may be understandable/considered appropriate to significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability). Exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual's history and cultural norms.*** [6]

#### 3. Secondary (Medical/Organic) Causes of Depression

This is the category you must **never miss**. The mechanism is either:
- **Direct physiological effect** on the brain (e.g., hypothyroidism → reduced monoamine synthesis; Cushing's → cortisol-mediated hippocampal damage)
- **Non-specific stressor** (e.g., chronic pain, cancer diagnosis → psychological burden leads to depression)

***Depression can be associated with medical conditions:*** [6]

| Category | Examples and Mechanisms |
|----------|----------------------|
| ***Neurological disorders*** | ***Epilepsy*** (interictal depression due to limbic dysfunction), ***Parkinson's disease*** (dopaminergic degeneration in mesolimbic pathway → anhedonia, amotivation), ***dementia*** (structural degeneration of mood-regulating circuits), ***multiple sclerosis*** (inflammatory demyelination disrupting prefrontal-limbic connections), ***Huntington disease*** (caudate atrophy → frontal-subcortical circuit disruption), ***cerebrovascular disease*** (especially left frontal strokes → disruption of monoaminergic pathways), ***migraine*** (shared serotonergic dysfunction) [6] |
| ***Endocrine disorders*** | ***Hypothyroidism*** (thyroid hormones potentiate monoamine activity; low T3/T4 → functional monoamine deficiency), ***hyperthyroidism*** (can paradoxically cause depression especially in elderly — "apathetic thyrotoxicosis"), ***Cushing's syndrome*** (chronic hypercortisolism → hippocampal atrophy → depression), ***Addison disease*** (cortisol deficiency → fatigue, low mood), ***prolactinomas*** (hyperprolactinaemia → dopamine suppression → anhedonia), ***hyperparathyroidism*** (hypercalcaemia → neurotoxicity → depression) [6] |
| ***Drug-related conditions*** | ***Antihypertensive medications esp. reserpine and methyldopa*** (reserpine depletes monoamines — this was the original observation supporting the monoamine hypothesis!), ***smoking-cessation aids, steroids, sex hormones and medications that affect sex hormones, H2 blockers, sedatives, muscle relaxants, appetite suppressants, chemotherapy agents*** [6] |
| ***Substance abuse*** | ***Alcohol / cocaine / amphetamines / cannabinoids / sedatives / hypnotics / narcotics abuse*** — both intoxication (especially depressants) and withdrawal (especially stimulants) can cause depressive syndromes [6] |
| ***Infectious disease*** | ***Mononucleosis*** (post-viral fatigue), ***HIV infection*** (direct CNS invasion + psychosocial burden), ***hepatitis C infection*** (neuroinflammation + interferon treatment), ***Lyme disease, syphilis*** (neurosyphilis affects frontal lobes) [6] |
| ***Neoplasias*** | ***Pancreatic cancer*** (classically associated with depression — possibly via paraneoplastic mechanisms or cytokine release even before cancer diagnosis), paraneoplastic syndromes [6] |
| ***Chronic diseases*** | ***Coronary artery disease, type II diabetes*** (shared inflammatory pathways, HPA axis dysregulation, reduced physical activity) [6] |
| ***Chronic pain and psychosomatic conditions*** | Chronic pain → sustained activation of stress response → HPA axis dysregulation → depression (and depression lowers pain threshold → vicious cycle) [6] |
| ***Sleep-related disorders*** | ***Obstructive sleep apnoea*** — chronic sleep fragmentation → daytime fatigue, cognitive impairment, low mood; hypoxia may directly affect mood-regulating centres [6] |

<Callout title="Must-Know Secondary Causes for Exams" type="error">
In any patient presenting with depression, you MUST rule out: (1) Hypothyroidism — the single most important medical mimic (check TFT in everyone); (2) Substance use — especially alcohol; (3) Medication side effects — especially beta-blockers, steroids, reserpine; (4) Cushing's syndrome — especially if atypical features; (5) Organic brain disease — especially in new-onset depression in the elderly. The basic workup for every depressed patient includes: CBP, R/LFT, TFT. Add further investigations as indicated by history and examination.
</Callout>

**Investigations to rule out secondary causes** [3][4]:

| Investigation | What It Rules Out |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **CBP** | Anaemia (fatigue mimics), ↑WCC (infection), ↑MCV (alcoholism/B12 deficiency) |
| **Renal function tests** | HypoNa (antidepressant side effect, SIADH), uraemia, Ca (hypercalcaemia → depression) |
| **Liver function tests** | GGT (alcoholic liver disease), hepatic encephalopathy |
| ***Thyroid function test*** | ***Hypothyroidism (secondary depression)*** — the single most important screening test |
| **Vitamin B12 and folate** | Nutritional deficiency (especially in elderly, alcoholism) |
| **Urine drug screen** | Substance-induced depression |
| **Blood alcohol level** | Alcohol-related depression |
| ***HIV test*** | ***HIV-associated depression*** |
| ***Cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test*** | ***Addison disease*** |
| **ECG** | Long QT (baseline before TCA or lithium) |
| ***EEG*** | ***Epilepsy*** |
| ***CT or MRI brain*** | ***Organic brain syndrome, hypopituitarism*** — especially in elderly, new-onset, or atypical presentations |

### B. Differential Diagnosis of Elated or Irritable Mood

***The differential diagnosis of a manic episode includes:*** [7]

#### 1. Primary Mood Disorders

| Diagnosis | Salient Differentiating Features |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| **Mania / Hypomania** | Episode of elated/irritable mood associated with ↑energy and activity with considerable interference with work and social activities. Further classified by: *level of psychosocial impairment* (considerable = hypomania; complete disruption = mania) and *presence of psychotic symptoms* (present = mania). Bipolar affective disorder if ≥ 1 previous mood episode [3] |
| ***Depressive disorder with irritability and anxious distress*** [7] | Recurrent depression with prominent irritability can be mistaken for bipolar. Key: hypomanic episodes can be missed or under-reported → should be actively elicited. Discerning features of bipolar depression: psychotic features, atypical features (hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis) [5] |

#### 2. Other Psychiatric Conditions

| Diagnosis | Why It Mimics Mania | How to Differentiate |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| ***Psychotic disorder or schizoaffective disorder*** [7] | Schizophrenia can present with excited, suspicious, or agitated mood (mimics mania with psychosis). Schizoaffective disorder has simultaneous mood and schizophrenic symptoms | **Schizophrenia**: psychotic symptoms NOT limited to periods of prominent mood disturbance; FTD more loosening of association, neologism, thought blocking (cf mania: circumstantiality, tangentiality, flight of ideas); delusions mood-incongruent, bizarre, with passivity/thought alienation; speech more hesitant/halting (mania: pressured, difficult to interrupt); less ↓need for sleep, less hyperactive; may have catatonia or negative symptoms. **Schizoaffective**: delusions/hallucinations less mood-congruent and may occur outside mood episodes [3][5] |
| ***Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)*** [7] | Similarities: ↓attention, difficulty with task completion, ↑energy, disinhibited behaviour, talkativeness | ADHD should NOT have ↑self-esteem, grandiosity, flight of ideas, or ↓need for sleep. ADHD has a more chronic, trait-like course (present since childhood) rather than episodic onset. Symptoms are pervasive across settings in ADHD but mood-episode-limited in bipolar [5][3] |
| ***Personality disorder with prominent irritability*** [7] | Borderline PD is often associated with marked affective instability → mimics rapid-cycling bipolar. Impulsivity, temper outbursts, mood lability overlap with hypomania | BPD: no family history of bipolar; rapid shifts of mood over hours/days (not days-to-weeks as in bipolar episodes); no classic manic symptoms (↑energy, grandiosity, flight of ideas, ↓need for sleep); mood disturbances often triggered by interpersonal issues; more stable/enduring pattern vs. episodic [5][3] |

> ***The bipolar spectrum: BP I has severe mood episodes; BP II has milder manic symptoms with a prominent depressive element and can have the same degree of long-term impairment as BP I; BP spectrum patients are bothered by frequent mood changes and can be mistaken as borderline personality disorder.*** [7]

#### 3. Secondary (Medical/Substance) Causes of Mania

| Category | Examples and Mechanisms |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Organic brain lesion** | Extreme social disinhibition with no gross mood disorder → think **frontal lobe pathology**. Consider especially in middle-aged or older patient with expansive behaviour but no past history of affective disorder. In younger patients, consider **HIV infection** and **head injury** [5] |
| ***Substance/medication-induced*** [7] | **Intoxication**: stimulants (amphetamines, cocaine, caffeine), corticosteroids, L-DOPA, antidepressants (especially in unrecognised bipolar → manic switch). **Withdrawal**: alcohol, sedatives. Should ↓ after admission/cessation; consider urine toxicology screen if appropriate [5] |
| ***Medical conditions*** [7] | Hyperthyroidism (thyroid hormones potentiate catecholamines → hyperarousal), Cushing's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (CNS vasculitis), neurosyphilis, multiple sclerosis, temporal lobe epilepsy |

<Callout title="Schizophrenia vs. Mania — The Hardest DDx in Psychiatry" type="error">
This is the single most difficult differential in acute psychiatry. Both can present with psychomotor agitation, grandiose delusions, and disordered speech. The key differentiators: (1) In mania, psychotic symptoms are mood-congruent and usually resolve with the mood episode; (2) In schizophrenia, psychosis persists independent of mood state; (3) In mania, the logical link in speech is preserved despite being rapid (flight of ideas); in schizophrenia, associations are truly loosened (loosening of associations); (4) Biological features differ — mania has genuinely decreased need for sleep (feeling rested after 2-3 hours), while schizophrenia rarely shows this pattern. When in doubt, longitudinal course is the ultimate discriminator.

### C. Specifiers — Further Refining the Differential

Once you've identified a mood disorder, specifiers help characterise it further and guide treatment. ***Mood disorders are heterogeneous conditions. Specifiers are used to better understand the patient's characteristics and to select appropriate treatment:*** [7]

| Specifier | Key Feature | Clinical Relevance |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| ***With anxious distress*** | Prominent anxiety symptoms during mood episode | Higher suicide risk, poorer treatment response |
| ***With mixed features*** | Depressive symptoms during mania, or manic symptoms during depression | Particularly high suicide risk (despair + energy); may need mood stabiliser rather than antidepressant |
| ***With rapid cycling*** | ***> 4 episodes per year*** | Poorer prognosis, often treatment-resistant, lithium may be less effective |
| ***With melancholic features*** | ***Near-complete absence of the capacity for pleasure***; early morning wakening, morning dysphoria, psychomotor changes, weight loss | More neurobiological basis, stronger family history, better response to TCAs/ECT than SSRIs [3] |
| ***With atypical features*** | ***Mood reactivity, weight gain, hypersomnia*** (also leaden paralysis, interpersonal rejection sensitivity) | Better response to MAOIs; think bipolar depression if atypical features are prominent |
| ***With psychotic features*** | Delusions and/or hallucinations | Must distinguish mood-congruent vs. mood-incongruent (mood-incongruent → worse prognosis, consider schizoaffective) |
| ***With peripartum onset*** | Onset during pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum | ***Severe anxiety and even panic attacks. Risk of infanticide*** — always assess safety of mother and baby [7] |
| ***With seasonal pattern*** | ***Depression begins in fall or winter and remits in spring*** | Consider bright light therapy; related to daylight duration [7] |

### E. Key DSM-5 Classification Reminder

***DSM-5 classification of mood disorders:*** [7]

| Bipolar and Related Disorders | Depressive Disorders |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| ***Bipolar I disorder*** | ***Major depressive disorder (single episode / recurrent)*** |
| ***Bipolar II disorder*** | ***Dysthymic disorder (persistent depressive disorder)*** |
| ***Cyclothymic disorder*** | ***Other depressive disorder*** |
| ***Other bipolar disorder*** | |

***Key DSM-5 changes from DSM-IV:*** [6]
- ***Dysthymia → Persistent depressive disorder*** (now includes both chronic MDD and previous dysthymic disorder)
- ***Introduction of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder***: persistent irritability and frequent episodes of extreme, out-of-control behaviour in children up to age 18
- ***Introduction of premenstrual dysphoric disorder***: mood symptoms during the final week before menses onset, improving within a few days of menses

<Callout title="High Yield DDx Summary">

**For Low Mood — Always consider:**
1. Secondary causes FIRST (hypothyroidism, medications, substance use, medical illness)
2. Bipolar depression (ask about past hypomania — missed in 10-20% of cases)
3. MDD vs. dysthymia vs. adjustment disorder (severity + duration + stressor)
4. Pseudodementia vs. true dementia (especially in elderly)
5. Anxiety disorder with secondary low mood
6. Personality disorder (BPD — chronic emptiness, rapid mood shifts)

**For Elated/Irritable Mood — Always consider:**
1. Secondary causes (substance intoxication, medications, medical — especially frontal lobe lesions, hyperthyroidism)
2. Mania vs. hypomania (severity, psychotic features, functional impairment)
3. Schizophrenia / schizoaffective disorder (most difficult DDx — check mood congruence of psychosis, longitudinal course)
4. ADHD (trait-like, no grandiosity/↓need for sleep)
5. Borderline PD (rapid mood shifts, interpersonal triggers, no classic manic features)

**Red Flags for Bipolar in a "Depressed" Patient:**
- Age of onset < 25
- Atypical depressive features (hypersomnia, hyperphagia)
- Psychotic features during depression
- Family history of bipolar disorder
- Multiple failed antidepressant trials or manic switch on antidepressants
- Postpartum onset
