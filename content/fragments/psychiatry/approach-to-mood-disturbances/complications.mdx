## Complications of Mood Disorders

Mood disorders are not just about feeling sad or elated. They are **systemic illnesses** with far-reaching consequences affecting virtually every organ system, social functioning, and survival. Thinking of complications from first principles, consider that mood disorders involve: (1) chronic neurobiological dysregulation (HPA axis, inflammation, autonomic dysfunction), (2) behavioural changes (inactivity, substance use, self-neglect, impulsivity), and (3) treatment side effects. Each of these pathways generates its own constellation of complications.

### 1. Suicide — The Most Important Complication

This is the complication that kills, and the one you must assess in every single patient, every single encounter.

#### Depression and Suicide

***WHO: Over 700,000 people commit suicide every year and many more attempt suicide. One of the major causes of suicide is depression.*** [6]

***Depression raises suicidal risk — increase in suicide risk attributable to depression was 20-fold.*** [6]

***Suicide was the cause of death in 6% of patients with an affective disorder, and the risk would be even higher in those with psychiatric comorbidities.*** [6]

***In a longitudinal study in Sweden spanning over half a century, the long-term suicide risk in subjects with depression was 6.0% after 54-64 years of follow-up.*** [6]

From the senior notes: > 20× risk of suicide in MDD; can approach **15% in those severe admitted cases** [3].

**Why does depression cause suicide?** The pathophysiology is multi-layered:
- **Hopelessness** — the cognitive triad (negative view of self, world, future) creates a perception that suffering is permanent and inescapable
- **Serotonergic deficiency** in the prefrontal cortex → impaired impulse control → inability to resist suicidal urges
- **Psychomotor retardation paradox** — severely depressed patients may be too retarded to act on suicidal thoughts; the dangerous period is when energy returns (early treatment response) before mood improves, giving the patient the "energy to act"
- **Psychotic features** — command auditory hallucinations, delusions of guilt/nihilism can directly drive self-harm

#### Bipolar Disorder and Suicide

Suicide risk in bipolar disorder is among the highest of any psychiatric condition:
- ~8% of hospitalised males and 5% of hospitalised females die by suicide over 40 years of follow-up [5]
- Risk is highest during **depressive episodes** and **mixed states** (combination of despair and impulsive energy)
- ***The distress caused by untreated mood symptoms results in increased suicidality, comorbid anxiety, and substance use disorders*** [7]

***Lithium is still an important drug, given that it is the only mood stabiliser to reduce suicide.*** [7] Why? Lithium's anti-suicidal effect appears to be partially independent of its mood-stabilising properties — it may directly reduce impulsivity and aggression via serotonergic modulation.

<Callout title="Suicide Risk Assessment — Never Skip This" type="error">
Every mood disorder patient must be assessed for suicide at every visit. Use a structured approach: Ideation → Plan → Means → Intent → Protective factors. High-risk features include: male sex, older age, living alone, recent loss, comorbid substance abuse, previous attempts, psychotic features, mixed states, recent discharge from hospital, and the early weeks of antidepressant treatment.

### 2. Non-Suicidal Mortality — Medical Complications

***Depression increases non-suicidal mortality.*** [6]

***Reviewed 61 reports: 72% demonstrated a positive association between depression and non-suicide mortality. RR = 1.2-4.0.*** [6]

***Possible mediators include: behavioural risk factors (e.g., poor adherence to treatment, inactivity, ↑alcohol consumption), biological risk factors (e.g., altered thrombogenesis), subclinical disease / prevalent disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease).*** [6]

For bipolar disorder: **mortality is significantly ↑, with ↓life expectancy by ~13 years (males) and ~9 years (females)** [5].

Let us break these mediators down systematically:

#### A. Cardiovascular Disease

| Pathway | Mechanism | Clinical Consequence |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| **HPA axis dysregulation** | Chronic hypercortisolism → insulin resistance, visceral obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension | Metabolic syndrome → atherosclerosis → MI, stroke |
| **Autonomic dysfunction** | ↓Heart rate variability (vagal withdrawal) in depression → sympathetic predominance | ↑Risk of arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death |
| **Inflammation** | ↑Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP) in depression → endothelial dysfunction | Accelerated atherosclerosis, plaque instability |
| **Altered thrombogenesis** | ↑Platelet activation and aggregation in depression (serotonin stored in platelets; dysregulated serotonin → platelet hyperactivity) | ↑Risk of acute coronary events and stroke |
| **Behavioural** | Physical inactivity, poor diet, smoking, medication non-adherence | Compounding all of the above |

This is why depression after myocardial infarction is a recognised independent risk factor for cardiac mortality — it's not just "feeling sad about being sick."

#### B. Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes

- Depression itself is associated with insulin resistance via cortisol and inflammatory pathways
- Many psychotropic medications worsen metabolic parameters:
  - **Atypical antipsychotics** (especially olanzapine, clozapine) → significant weight gain, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia, new-onset type 2 diabetes
  - **Mirtazapine** → weight gain via H1 antagonism (stimulates appetite)
  - **Lithium** → weight gain, hypothyroidism (both contribute to metabolic syndrome)
  - **Valproate** → weight gain, polycystic ovary syndrome

For bipolar disorder specifically: **↑cardiovascular disease / metabolic syndrome (medication side effects, poor lifestyle)** is a major contributor to the reduced life expectancy [5].

***Atypical antipsychotics look promising as mood stabilisers, but limited by metabolic side effects.*** [7]

#### C. Consequences of Comorbid Substance Abuse

Substance abuse is both a complication of and contributor to mood disorders, creating a vicious cycle:

- **Depression**: alcoholism is the most common comorbidity (occurs in ~40% of alcoholics); depression may drive self-medication with alcohol, and chronic alcohol use depletes monoamines, worsening depression [3]
- **Bipolar I**: alcoholism in 60% of patients — during manic episodes, hyperexcitability and impulsivity lead to ↑alcohol intake; alcoholism aggravates bipolar disorder and is associated with ↑suicide rate [3]
- Consequences: liver disease, nutritional deficiency (Wernicke-Korsakoff), accidents, violence, social deterioration, non-adherence to psychiatric medications

---

### 3. Functional Impairment and Psychosocial Complications

#### Occupational Disability

- Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide (WHO Global Burden of Disease)
- Cognitive symptoms (poor concentration, indecisiveness, psychomotor retardation) directly impair work performance
- Only ~25% of those with recurrent major depression achieve 5-year clinical stability with good social and occupational performance [3]
- Bipolar disorder: only < 20% achieve a 5-year period of clinical stability [5]

#### Social and Interpersonal Consequences

- Social withdrawal (driven by anhedonia and anergia) → isolation → further worsening of depression
- Mania: reckless decisions, extravagant spending, sexual indiscretions, aggressive behaviour → damaged relationships, financial ruin, legal problems
- **Advanced statements** are recommended for bipolar patients to address social implications of poor judgment during manic states [5]

#### Impact on Family and Caregivers

- Caregiver burden is significant — mood disorders are chronic relapsing conditions
- High expressed emotion (criticism, hostility, over-involvement) in families predicts relapse
- Family psychoeducation is a critical intervention to reduce relapse rates [7]
- Children of depressed parents: ↑risk of developing depression themselves (genetic + environmental), attachment difficulties, behavioural problems

---

### 4. Cognitive Complications

#### Depression-Related Cognitive Impairment

- Acute episodes: poor concentration, indecisiveness, psychomotor slowing — these are **state-dependent** and typically improve with remission
- Chronic/recurrent depression: cumulative **hippocampal volume loss** (cortisol-mediated neurotoxicity) can lead to persistent cognitive deficits even between episodes
- In elderly patients: depressive pseudodementia can be indistinguishable from early dementia; importantly, depression in late life is a **risk factor for subsequent true dementia**

#### Bipolar Disorder — Progressive Cognitive Decline

***Staging of illness:*** [7]

- ***Stage 1: High-risk group (positive family history) or patients with subsyndromal symptoms***
- ***Stage 2: Patients with a few episodes and optimal functioning***
- ***Stage 3: Recurrent episodes and decline in functioning and cognition***

***Neuroprogression theory: worse prognosis with frequent relapses.*** [7]

***Increased risk of future development of dementia.*** [7]

This is a crucial concept — bipolar disorder is increasingly recognised as a **neuroprogressive** illness. With each mood episode, there is accumulative neuronal damage (via excitotoxicity during mania, cortisol toxicity during depression, and neuroinflammation). This manifests as:
- Global cognitive deficits (attention, memory, executive function) that may persist even in euthymic periods [5]
- Progressive functional decline
- Increased risk of developing dementia in later life

**Why do frequent relapses worsen prognosis?** The "kindling" model explains that early episodes require a stressor to trigger them, but successive episodes become increasingly autonomous and easier to trigger — the brain becomes sensitised. Each episode causes further neuroplastic damage, creating a self-perpetuating cycle. This is the strongest argument for aggressive maintenance treatment and relapse prevention.

<Callout title="Neuroprogression — The Case for Early, Aggressive Treatment">
Every mood episode matters. The neuroprogression theory teaches us that bipolar disorder is not just a series of discrete episodes — it is a progressive illness where each relapse causes cumulative brain damage. This is why the emphasis on maintenance treatment is so strong: preventing episodes is not just about quality of life in the short term, but about preserving cognitive function and preventing dementia in the long term. Start treatment early, maintain it consistently, and prevent relapses.

### 5. Recurrence and Chronicity

#### Unipolar Depression [3]

- **Recurrence**: ~80% will recur; average ~4 further episodes in 25 years
- Usually associated with progressively shorter intervals between episodes
- ~50% do not have complete symptom remission between episodes (residual symptoms)
- ~10-20% develop a chronic unremitting course

**Prognosticants for relapse** [3]:
1. Incomplete symptomatic remission
2. Early age of onset
3. Poor social support
4. Poor physical health
5. Comorbid substance abuse
6. Comorbid personality disorder

#### Bipolar Disorder [5]

- Onset ~20 years; usually begins as depression with first manic episode occurring ~5 years later
- Manic episodes usually self-limited, resolving within ~6 months even if untreated
- 2-year outcome after first mania: 98% syndromal recovery, 72% symptomatic recovery, 43% functional recovery, 40% relapse
- Further mood episodes occur in ≥ 90% of manic patients; usually ~4 major episodes per 10 years
- Depressive episodes far outnumber manic episodes in both Bipolar I and II
- Patients on maintenance treatment with no relapse for many years CAN still relapse after cessation — relatives should be educated on prodromal symptoms to allow early treatment [5]

***Recurrence rate in first-episode bipolar disorder: naturalistic 1-year follow-up showed high rates of recurrent mood episodes, with depressive episodes predominating.*** [7]

***Poor prognostic factors for bipolar disorder:*** [7]
- ***Early onset***
- ***Greater severity, mixed episodes, repeated episodes, previous hospitalisations***
- ***Residual symptoms, cognitive impairment***
- ***Poor insight, side effects of medications***
- ***Comorbid substance or personality disorder***

**Prognosis: poor** — only < 20% of bipolar patients achieve a 5-year period of clinical stability [5].

**Bipolar II disorder** has a relatively better prognosis than Bipolar I as a positive prognostic factor [5].

### 6. Treatment-Related Complications

These are iatrogenic complications arising from the medications used to treat mood disorders:

| Treatment | Complication | Mechanism | Prevention/Monitoring |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **SSRIs** | Serotonin syndrome (with MAOIs) | Excessive synaptic serotonin → autonomic instability, hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus | Never combine SSRIs with MAOIs; 2-week washout (5 weeks for fluoxetine due to long half-life) |
| **SSRIs** | ↑Suicidal risk (age < 25) | Energy returns before mood → "energy to act" on suicidal thoughts | Close monitoring in first 2-4 weeks, especially in young patients |
| **SSRIs** | SIADH/hyponatraemia | Stimulation of ADH release → dilutional hyponatraemia | Monitor Na in elderly; risk factors: age, female sex, low BMI, concurrent diuretics |
| **SSRIs** | Sexual dysfunction | Serotonin inhibits dopaminergic reward and spinal ejaculatory reflexes | Switch to bupropion or mirtazapine if problematic |
| **SSRIs + NSAIDs** | Upper GI bleeding | SSRIs ↓platelet serotonin → impaired aggregation; NSAIDs damage gastric mucosa | Avoid combination; add PPI if necessary |
| **TCAs** | Cardiac toxicity (overdose) | Sodium channel blockade → QT prolongation → torsades de pointes | Avoid in patients with cardiac disease; ECG monitoring; dangerous in overdose (hence avoid in suicidal patients) |
| **Lithium** | Hypothyroidism | Inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis and release | Monitor TFT every 6 months; treat with levothyroxine if needed |
| **Lithium** | Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus | Blocks ADH action on collecting ducts (inhibits aquaporin-2 insertion) → inability to concentrate urine | Monitor RFT, fluid balance; polyuria/polydipsia are early signs |
| **Lithium** | Lithium toxicity | Narrow therapeutic index; dehydration, renal impairment, drug interactions (NSAIDs, diuretics, ACEIs) ↑levels | Keep plasma level 0.5-1.0 mmol/L; regular monitoring; educate patient about dehydration risks |
| **Lithium** | Teratogenicity | Ebstein anomaly (downward displacement of tricuspid valve) | Avoid in first trimester if possible; folic acid supplementation |
| **Valproate** | Teratogenicity | Neural tube defects (spina bifida), developmental delay | Absolutely contraindicated in women of childbearing potential unless no alternative; MHRA pregnancy prevention programme |
| **Valproate** | Hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis | Direct hepatotoxic effect; mechanism of pancreatitis unclear | Monitor LFTs; educate about symptoms |
| **Lamotrigine** | Stevens-Johnson syndrome / TEN | Hypersensitivity reaction (immune-mediated keratinocyte apoptosis) | Very slow titration (over weeks); higher risk with concurrent valproate (inhibits lamotrigine metabolism) |
| **Carbamazepine** | DRESS/SJS | HLA-B*1502-mediated hypersensitivity (common in Han Chinese population) | HLA-B*1502 testing before starting — especially important in Hong Kong |
| **Atypical antipsychotics** | Metabolic syndrome | H1 and 5-HT2C antagonism → weight gain; insulin resistance → diabetes, dyslipidaemia | Regular metabolic monitoring (weight, glucose, lipids); worst with olanzapine and clozapine |
| **Antidepressants in bipolar** | Manic switch / cycle acceleration | Monoamine increase destabilises mood regulation in bipolar brain → tips into mania | ***Avoid antidepressants if possible; if used, limit dose and duration*** [7]; always combine with mood stabiliser |

---

### 7. Complications of Misdiagnosis

***Misdiagnosis is especially common — among 600 patients with bipolar disorder, 69% were initially misdiagnosed, most frequently as major depression, followed by anxiety disorders, substance or alcohol use disorder.*** [7]

***Correct diagnosis and treatment was delayed by 5-7 years on average.*** [7]

The consequences of misdiagnosis form their own category of complication:

| Direction | Consequences |
|-----------|-------------|
| ***Underdiagnosis of bipolar*** | ***Untreated mood symptoms → increased suicidality, comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders; poor QoL, greater functional impairment, increased healthcare cost; antidepressant monotherapy → manic switch and cycle acceleration*** [7] |
| ***Overdiagnosis of bipolar*** | ***Unnecessary side effects of mood stabilisers; increased sick role and disability claims*** [7] |

---

### 8. Peripartum Complications

- **Peripartum depression**: affects 10-15% of women; consequences include impaired maternal-infant bonding, developmental delays in the child, neglect
- **Postpartum psychosis/mania**: there is a **50% risk of postpartum mania in untreated bipolar disorder** [5] — this is a psychiatric emergency with risk of infanticide and suicide
- Treatment must balance maternal mental health with fetal/neonatal safety (see management section for drug choices in pregnancy)

<Callout title="High Yield Complications Summary">

**Suicide**: The #1 cause of mortality in mood disorders. MDD: 20× risk, 6-15% lifetime. Bipolar: ~8% males, ~5% females. Highest risk in depressive episodes, mixed states, early treatment phase, psychotic features.

**Non-suicidal mortality**: ↓Life expectancy by 9-13 years in bipolar. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause — driven by HPA axis dysregulation, inflammation, altered thrombogenesis, metabolic syndrome (often worsened by medications), and behavioural factors.

**Neuroprogression**: Each mood episode causes cumulative brain damage. Bipolar disorder progresses through stages with increasing cognitive decline. Frequent relapses → increased risk of dementia. This is the strongest argument for aggressive maintenance treatment.

**Recurrence**: MDD ~80% recurrence; Bipolar ≥ 90%. Only 20-25% achieve sustained clinical stability. Prognostic factors include incomplete remission, early onset, comorbid substance/personality disorder.

**Treatment complications**: Serotonin syndrome (SSRIs + MAOIs), lithium toxicity/hypothyroidism/NDI/teratogenicity, valproate teratogenicity, lamotrigine SJS, carbamazepine DRESS (test HLA-B*1502 in Han Chinese), atypical antipsychotic metabolic syndrome, antidepressant-induced manic switch.

**Misdiagnosis**: 69% of bipolar patients initially misdiagnosed; average delay 5-7 years; leads to inappropriate treatment and worse outcomes.
