## Complications and Prognosis of Child Psychiatric Conditions

### Understanding "Complications" in Child Psychiatry

In medicine, we usually think of "complications" as things that go wrong *because of* a disease — like a diabetic foot ulcer from diabetes. In child psychiatry, the concept is broader. Complications arise from three sources:

1. **The disorder itself** — untreated or inadequately treated conditions lead to cascading developmental, academic, social, and psychological harm.
2. **Comorbidity** — child psychiatric conditions breed other conditions. ADHD leads to ODD, which leads to CD, which leads to substance abuse. Depression breeds anxiety. ASD breeds depression. This "comorbidity cascade" is arguably the biggest complication of all.
3. **Treatment** — medications and even psychosocial interventions have side effects and unintended consequences (iatrogenic complications).

The fundamental principle: **the developing brain does not wait.** Every month that a child's condition goes untreated, they fall further behind their peers in academic, social, and emotional development. These deficits compound over time. A 7-year-old with untreated ADHD who misses a year of foundational literacy skills doesn't just lose one year — they lose the scaffolding upon which all subsequent learning is built. This is why early identification and intervention matter so much.

### A. Complications by Condition

---

#### 1. ADHD — Complications and Course

##### Natural History [1]

***Course: generally show age-dependent ↓severity (hyperactivity > impulsiveness > inattention), but a substantial proportion persist into adulthood or experience functional impairment*** [1]:
- ***~50% retain full diagnostic criteria in adolescence*** [1]
- ***~40–60% experience problems in adulthood*** [1]

This age-dependent decline in severity follows a predictable pattern. **Hyperactivity** declines first because it is the most "visible" and most responsive to developmental maturation of motor circuits. **Impulsivity** declines next as the prefrontal cortex continues maturing (PFC maturation extends into the mid-20s). **Inattention** is the most persistent because it reflects the deepest deficit in executive function and working memory circuits — these higher-order cognitive processes are the last to fully mature.

***Poor prognostic factors: learning difficulties, antisocial behaviour, severe overactivity*** [1]
***In particular, when comorbid with CD, particularly at risk of antisocial, criminal behaviours and substance abuse*** [1]

##### Complications Table

| Domain | Childhood Complications | Adolescent Complications | Adult Complications | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Academic** | Underperformance despite normal IQ, grade retention, special education needs, school exclusion | School dropout, failure to graduate, inability to pursue higher education | ***Occupational failure*** [1], underemployment relative to intellectual ability | Inattention → inability to sustain effort on academic tasks → cumulative knowledge gaps. Working memory deficits → difficulty following multi-step instructions |
| **Social** | Peer rejection (impulsive/intrusive behaviour is aversive to peers), fewer close friendships, bullying (both as victim and perpetrator) | Social isolation, risky peer group affiliation | ***Relationship problems*** [1], higher divorce rates, interpersonal conflict | Impulsivity → social norm violation → peer exclusion. Inattention → missing social cues → misinterpreting others' intentions |
| **Behavioural** | ODD comorbidity (~40%), CD comorbidity (~20%) [1] | ***Antisocial behaviour, criminal behaviours*** [1], truancy, delinquency | Antisocial personality disorder (in those with childhood-onset CD) | Executive dysfunction + impulsivity → poor self-regulation → escalating oppositionality. The developmental cascade: ADHD → ODD → CD → antisocial PD |
| **Substance use** | — | Early initiation of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis. ***Substance abuse (~15%)*** [1] | ***Substance abuse*** [1], higher rates of nicotine dependence | Impulsivity → novelty-seeking → experimentation. Dopaminergic reward circuit dysfunction → self-medication hypothesis (substances temporarily normalise reward signalling). Paradoxically, treated ADHD *reduces* later substance abuse risk |
| **Emotional** | Low self-esteem ("I'm stupid," "I'm naughty"), frustration, demoralisation | Depression (~20%), anxiety (~25%) [1] | ***Self-esteem issues*** [1], depression, anxiety | Repeated failure experiences → learned helplessness → negative self-schema. The discrepancy between ability and performance is particularly frustrating |
| **Physical safety** | ***Injuries*** [1] — higher rates of A&E visits, accidental injuries | Road traffic accidents (impulsive driving), sports injuries | ***Injuries/accidents*** [1], higher rates of motor vehicle collisions | Impulsivity + inattention → failure to anticipate danger → risk-taking without awareness of consequences |
| **Economic** | — | — | Higher healthcare costs, lower lifetime earnings, higher welfare dependency | Cumulative effect of academic underachievement + occupational instability + relationship breakdown |

<Callout title="The ADHD → Substance Abuse Paradox">
Parents often worry that giving their child a "controlled substance" (methylphenidate, amphetamine) will lead to addiction. The evidence shows the opposite: **treating ADHD with stimulants reduces the risk of later substance abuse by approximately 50%** (meta-analysis by Wilens et al.). Why? Because untreated ADHD drives self-medication with tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol. The stimulant medication normalises dopaminergic reward signalling, removing the drive to self-medicate.
</Callout>

##### ***Presentation of ADHD in Adulthood*** [1]

| Domain | Childhood Manifestation | Adult Manifestation |
|---|---|---|
| ***Inattention*** | Difficulty sustaining attention, doesn't listen, no follow-through, cannot organise, loses important items, easily distractible, forgetful [1] | ***Difficulty sustaining attention in meetings, reading, or paperwork. Paralysing procrastination. Slowness, inefficiency. Poor time management. Disorganisation*** [1] |
| ***Hyperactivity*** | Squirms/fidgets, can't stay seated, runs/climbs excessively, can't play quietly, "on the go," talks excessively [1] | ***Workaholic, overscheduled and overwhelmed, self-select very active jobs*** [1] |
| ***Impulsivity*** | Blurts out answers, can't wait turn, interrupts | Impulsive financial decisions, relationship instability, road rage, job-hopping |

---

#### 2. ASD — Complications and Course

##### Natural History [1]

***Subsequent course: tendency for core symptoms to improve over time*** [1]
- ***Symptoms are typically most marked in early childhood and early school years*** [1]
- ***Later developmental gains result in learning and compensation, therefore remediating core symptoms to some extent*** [1]

***Prognosis: only minority can live and work independently in adulthood*** [1]
- ***Those who do tend to have superior language and intellectual abilities (good prognostic factors) and are able to find a niche that matches their special interests/skills*** [1]
- ***ASD adults use compensation strategies and coping mechanisms to mask their difficulties in public but suffer from the stress and effort of maintaining a socially acceptable facade*** [1]

##### Complications Table

| Domain | Complication | Pathophysiological / Developmental Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Psychiatric comorbidity** | ***Behavioural problems: self-injurious behaviour, hyperactivity, disruptive or challenging behaviour, soiling/enuresis, sleep disorders, ADHD (30–50%)*** [1]. ***Mood problems: anxiety, depression (especially in adolescent stage)*** [1] | ASD + normal/high intelligence = awareness of being "different" → social isolation → depression. Sensory overload → challenging behaviour as escape mechanism. Comorbid ADHD reflects shared neurodevelopmental vulnerability (overlapping genetic risk) |
| **Seizures** | ***Seizures (25%): usually develop by adolescence*** [1] | Underlying cortical hyperexcitability — the same abnormal neural connectivity that produces ASD symptoms also lowers seizure threshold. Higher risk in those with comorbid intellectual disability |
| **Motor** | ***Motor deficits: abnormal gaits, clumsiness, toe-walking, other abnormal motor signs*** [1]. ***Catatonia-like features: freezing mid-action, slowing*** [1] | Cerebellar and basal ganglia involvement in ASD (beyond just "social brain" networks). Catatonia risk increases in adolescence and is an underrecognised complication |
| **Language** | Persistent language impairment in ~50% (ranging from non-verbal to functional but pragmatically impaired) [1] | Variable depending on severity and intellectual level. ***Variable impairment: non-existent, only physical gestures, single words, sentences, normal speech but impairment when used in context*** [1] |
| **Academic** | Learning difficulties, inability to cope with mainstream school demands | Executive function deficits, sensory overload in classroom, inflexibility with changes in routine |
| **Social** | Social isolation, victimisation/bullying, exploitation by peers, difficulty maintaining employment | Core social-communication deficits persist even when compensated. ***Suffer from the stress and effort of maintaining a socially acceptable facade*** [1] — this is now called "autistic burnout" |
| **Masking/Camouflaging burnout** | Exhaustion, depression, suicidality — especially in late-diagnosed women and high-functioning individuals | The cognitive effort of constantly monitoring and imitating social behaviour depletes executive resources, leading to psychological collapse |

<Callout title="Autistic Burnout">
This is an increasingly recognised phenomenon. Adults with ASD who have "camouflaged" successfully for years may suddenly decompensate — losing previously acquired coping skills, becoming unable to work, developing severe depression. It is driven by the chronic stress of masking. Clinically, it can be mistaken for a new-onset psychotic episode or severe depressive episode. Always enquire about developmental history in any adult presenting with sudden functional decline.
</Callout>

#### 3. ODD/CD — Complications and Course

##### Natural History [1]

**ODD** [1]:
- ***Onset: usually appear during preschool years*** [1]
- ***Often precedes development of CD, especially those with defiant, argumentative, and vindictive behaviour*** [1]
- ***↑risk of adjustment problems in adult, e.g., antisocial behaviour, impulse-control problems, substance abuse, anxiety, depression*** [1]

**CD** [1]:
- ***Onset: emerge mid-childhood to mid-adolescence*** [1]
- ***Variable course, with progressively severe conduct problems in some individuals (e.g., theft → rape, robbery)*** [1]
- ***Some will show antisocial personality disorder, e.g., violent offending, heavy drug usage, teenage pregnancy, inability to graduate*** [1]
- ***Prognosis is worse for early-onset cases (antisocial behaviour in 40% early-onset cases and only 20% in adolescent-onset cases)*** [1]

##### The Developmental Cascade: ODD → CD → Antisocial PD

This is one of the best-documented developmental trajectories in child psychiatry:

```
Early childhood          Middle childhood         Adolescence              Adulthood
    ODD    ────────────>     CD          ────────>   Substance abuse  ────> Antisocial PD
(defiance,                (violation of            (self-medication,        (criminal behaviour,
 tantrums)                 rights/norms)            peer influence)          inability to sustain
                                                                            relationships/work)
```

**Why does this cascade happen?**
1. **ODD** → child is difficult, oppositional, hostile → **peer rejection** + **parental exhaustion** → inadequate supervision
2. Inadequate supervision + peer rejection → child drifts toward **deviant peer group** (the only peers who accept them)
3. Deviant peer group reinforces **antisocial behaviour** → escalation to CD-level behaviours (theft, aggression)
4. CD behaviours → **school exclusion, criminal justice involvement** → further alienation from prosocial systems
5. Without intervention, the pattern crystallises into **antisocial personality disorder** (by definition, diagnosed only after age 18)

***Factors that predict poor outcome in children with conduct disorder*** [1]:

| In the Young Person | In the Family | In the Wider Environment |
|---|---|---|
| Early onset, severe antisocial behaviours, callous-unemotional traits, comorbid ADHD | Parental criminality, parental substance abuse, poor supervision, family conflict, low warmth | Economically deprived areas, disorganised neighbourhoods, schools with high delinquency rates [1] |

##### Specific Complications

| Complication | Details | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Substance abuse** | Early tobacco, alcohol, cannabis. Progression to harder drugs. ***Heavy drug usage*** [1] | Self-medication for comorbid depression/ADHD + deviant peer influence + impulsivity |
| **Criminal behaviour** | ***Violent offending*** [1], property crime, juvenile detention | Violation of others' rights is the core feature of CD; without intervention it escalates |
| **Educational failure** | School exclusion, ***inability to graduate*** [1] | Behaviour prevents learning; school exclusion removes structure and supervision |
| **Teenage pregnancy** | ***Teenage pregnancy*** [1] | Impulsivity + poor decision-making + early sexual activity |
| **Injuries** | Self-inflicted (reckless behaviour), inflicted on others, involvement in violence | Reckless/impulsive behaviour in dangerous situations |
| **Adult mental health** | Antisocial PD, depression, substance use disorders, anxiety | The developmental cascade described above; chronic adversity breeds further psychopathology |

---

#### 4. Childhood Anxiety Disorders — Complications and Course

##### Natural History [1]

***Prognosis: nearly 2/3 expected to disappear in 3–5 years*** [1] — this sounds reassuring, but:
***~1/3 of them will have other categories of anxiety disorders at follow-up*** [1]

This phenomenon is called **homotypic and heterotypic continuity**:
- **Homotypic continuity**: the same disorder persists (e.g., separation anxiety at 6 → separation anxiety at 10)
- **Heterotypic continuity**: the specific disorder changes but the broad category persists (e.g., separation anxiety at 6 → social phobia at 14 → GAD at 20)

The underlying **trait of anxiety proneness** (behavioural inhibition, amygdala hyperreactivity) doesn't go away — it just expresses itself through different content as the child's cognitive and social world expands.

##### Selective Mutism — Specific Prognosis [1]

***Prognosis: often poor, with 58% remission rate at 13 years*** [1]
***Associated with later development of phobia, social anxiety, ↑risk for depression, substance misuse in unresolved cases*** [1]

##### Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **School refusal / academic underperformance** | Avoidance of anxiety-provoking school environment → missed education → cumulative knowledge gaps |
| **Social isolation** | Avoidance of peer interactions → failure to develop social skills → loneliness → depression |
| **Somatic symptom burden** | Chronic anxiety → persistent autonomic activation → frequent somatic complaints (headache, abdominal pain) → overinvestigation → medical system burden + illness role reinforcement |
| **Adult anxiety and depression** | Childhood anxiety is the strongest predictor of adult anxiety disorders. Also increases risk of adult depression (shared genetic vulnerability via 5-HTTLPR, shared neural circuits) |
| **Substance abuse** | Adolescents with untreated anxiety may self-medicate with alcohol or cannabis (anxiolytic effect). This is especially common in social anxiety |
| **Functional impairment without diagnosis** | "Quiet" anxious children may be overlooked because they are not disruptive. They suffer silently with poor self-esteem, avoidance, and underperformance without ever being referred |

---

#### 5. Youth Depression — Complications and Course [1]

***Prognosis: episodic relapsing course, with majority recovering < 3 months but 15% lasting > 18 months*** [1]

##### Key Complications

| Complication | Details | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Suicide** | Leading cause of death in adolescents with depression. Risk amplified by comorbid substance use, impulsivity (comorbid ADHD/CD), access to means, social isolation | Hopelessness + cognitive constriction ("no way out") + impulsivity in adolescents. ***Beware of suicidal risk in SSRIs*** [1] — risk highest in first 2 weeks of treatment |
| **Self-harm** | Cutting, overdose, burning — increasingly common from age 10+. May or may not be associated with suicidal intent | Emotional dysregulation → self-harm as affect regulation strategy ("physical pain replaces emotional pain") |
| **Substance abuse** | ***70% has anxiety disorder, CD, substance abuse, dysthymia*** as comorbidities [1]. ***Behavioural problems, e.g., one case tried to steal a bus because of frustration at home, take cannabis to lift mood due to depression*** [1] | Self-medication hypothesis: cannabis and alcohol temporarily relieve depressive symptoms but worsen them long-term (alcohol is a CNS depressant; cannabis disrupts dopaminergic reward signalling) |
| **Academic decline** | Poor concentration, amotivation, absenteeism → falling grades | Prefrontal hypofunction → executive dysfunction + anhedonia → inability to engage with learning |
| **Recurrence** | ~60% will have a recurrence within 5 years. Risk of adult recurrent depressive disorder | Each depressive episode may cause neuroplastic changes (hippocampal atrophy, HPA axis sensitisation) that lower the threshold for subsequent episodes ("kindling" hypothesis) |
| **Bipolar conversion** | ***~25% of BAD first presented as a juvenile depression in their first episode*** [1] | Shared genetic vulnerability. Early depression may be the first expression of an underlying bipolar diathesis. Antidepressant treatment without mood stabiliser cover may precipitate a manic switch |
| **Social and interpersonal harm** | Withdrawal from friends and family, loss of social skills during critical developmental window, damaged relationships | Depression → social withdrawal → peer rejection → further depression (self-perpetuating cycle) |

---

### B. Complications of Treatment (Iatrogenic)

These are equally important because they are **preventable**:

#### Medication Side Effects

| Medication | Key Complications | Mechanism | Monitoring |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamines)** | Appetite suppression → growth retardation (~1–3 cm over 2–3 years), insomnia, tics (uncommon, usually do not worsen existing tics), cardiovascular effects (↑HR, ↑BP), mood lability, rare psychotic symptoms at high doses | Sympathomimetic effects (NA/DA agonism) → appetite centre suppression, sleep-wake disruption, sympathetic activation | Height/weight/BMI at every visit, BP/HR, tic monitoring, appetite diary |
| **Atomoxetine** | Hepatotoxicity (rare but serious — stop if jaundice), suicidal ideation (FDA warning), nausea, mood changes | Selective NRI → mechanism of suicidal ideation unclear (similar to SSRI concern — restoring motivation before mood) | LFTs at baseline, monitor for mood/suicidal ideation, especially in first 4 weeks |
| **SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline)** | Suicidal ideation in first 2 weeks (FDA black box in < 25), activation syndrome (agitation, insomnia, restlessness), GI upset, sexual dysfunction (in adolescents), serotonin syndrome (if combined with other serotonergic agents), emotional blunting | ↑5HT → initial anxiogenic effect before therapeutic benefit (explains early activation). Serotonin syndrome: excess 5HT at all receptor subtypes → hyperthermia, clonus, agitation | Weekly review for first 4 weeks, then fortnightly for next 4 weeks |
| **Antipsychotics (risperidone, aripiprazole)** | ***Beware of polypharmacy and difference in sensitivity to medications*** [1]. Metabolic syndrome (weight gain, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia — especially olanzapine, quetiapine), hyperprolactinaemia (risperidone → gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularity), sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms | D2 blockade in tuberoinfundibular pathway → ↑prolactin. H1/5HT2C blockade → appetite stimulation → weight gain. D2 blockade in nigrostriatal pathway → EPS | Weight, fasting glucose, lipids, prolactin at baseline and Q3–6 months. Watch for EPS at every visit |
| **Mood stabilisers (lithium, valproate)** | Lithium: tremor, polyuria/polydipsia (nephrogenic DI), hypothyroidism, renal impairment, teratogenicity (Ebstein anomaly). Valproate: hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, teratogenicity (NTD — **avoid in girls of childbearing age**), weight gain, PCOS | Lithium: concentrating defect in collecting duct (antagonises ADH/V2R); interferes with thyroid hormone synthesis. Valproate: mitochondrial toxicity in hepatocytes; inhibition of folate metabolism (NTD risk) | Lithium: levels Q6mo, RFT, TFT, Ca. Valproate: LFTs, CBP (thrombocytopaenia), drug levels |
| **Melatonin** | Generally safe. Rare: headache, daytime drowsiness | Exogenous melatonin supplements endogenous circadian signalling | Minimal monitoring needed |

#### Complications of Psychosocial Interventions

| Intervention | Potential Complications | How to Mitigate |
|---|---|---|
| **Labelling effect** | Being given a psychiatric diagnosis (ADHD, ASD, CD) can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Teachers and parents may lower expectations. The child may internalise "I am broken" | Frame diagnosis as explanation, not excuse. Emphasise strengths. Psychoeducation that addresses stigma |
| **Parental guilt/blame** | Parents may feel responsible for their child's condition, especially in conditions where parenting is implicated (ODD/CD) or where family dynamics are explored (family therapy) | Explicitly state that psychiatric conditions are not caused by "bad parenting" alone. Validate parental struggle. PMT is about teaching *skills*, not assigning blame |
| **Therapeutic dependency** | Prolonged therapy without clear goals can create dependency on the therapist and delay development of autonomous coping | Time-limited therapy protocols (e.g., 12-session CBT) with explicit goals, built-in review points, and planned termination |
| **Social skills group — negative modelling** | Grouping conduct-disordered children together can paradoxically reinforce antisocial behaviour (deviant peer training effect) | Carefully curate group composition. Avoid grouping severe CD adolescents together. Mix with prosocial peers when possible |

---

### C. Complications of the Assessment Process Itself

This is rarely discussed but clinically important:

| Complication | Explanation | How to Mitigate |
|---|---|---|
| **Assessment trauma** | Repeated assessments by multiple professionals can be re-traumatising for children with abuse histories. Being asked to recount traumatic experiences multiple times worsens PTSD symptoms | Coordinate between agencies. Use single-assessment models where possible. Read previous records before re-asking |
| **False reassurance from negative assessment** | If assessment fails to identify a genuine condition (e.g., ASD in a masking girl), the family may be falsely reassured and not re-present until much later when complications have accumulated | Always document uncertainty. Advise re-referral if concerns persist. "Not meeting criteria today does not mean there is no problem" |
| **Delay in assessment** | Long waiting lists (a significant issue in Hong Kong's public CAMHS) mean children wait months to years for assessment. During this time, complications accumulate | Interim support from school and primary care while waiting. Prioritise high-risk cases. Use screening tools to stratify urgency |
| **Labelling before assessment is complete** | A premature diagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment (e.g., stimulants for a child with anxiety-driven inattention, not ADHD) | Complete the full assessment before diagnosing. ***Standardized behaviour rating scales: more objective but diagnosis should still be based on structured interview and collateral information only (rating is for reference only)*** [1] |

---

### D. Complications Related to Comorbidity

***Common comorbidities: 70% has anxiety disorder, CD, substance abuse, dysthymia*** (in youth depression) [1]
***Comorbidities: very common (50%), especially in severe cases (↑comorbidities for ↑number of ADHD symptoms)*** [1]

| Primary Condition | Common Comorbidity | Complication of Comorbidity | Why They Co-occur |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ADHD** | ODD (~40%), CD (~20%), learning disorder (~25%), anxiety (~25%), mood disorder (~20%), substance abuse (~15%) [1] | Each comorbidity independently worsens prognosis and compounds the other. ADHD + CD = worst trajectory (antisocial PD, crime, substance abuse) | Shared genetic vulnerability (dopamine/serotonin systems), shared environmental risk factors (adversity), cascade effects (ADHD causes frustration → ODD) |
| **ASD** | ***ADHD (30–50%)*** [1], ID (30–50%), anxiety, depression, ***seizures (25%)*** [1], sleep disorders | Comorbid ID = much worse functional prognosis. Comorbid ADHD = more behavioural challenges. Comorbid epilepsy = medication interactions, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) | Shared neurodevelopmental mechanisms. Cortical hyperexcitability underlies both ASD features and seizures |
| **Depression** | Anxiety (70%), CD, substance abuse, dysthymia [1] | Suicidality risk highest when depression + SA + impulsivity. "Double depression" (MDD + dysthymia) = chronic and difficult to treat | Shared genetic/neurobiological vulnerability (5-HTTLPR, HPA axis dysregulation). Anxiety may develop first and then "evolve" into depression |
| **ODD** | ADHD, depression, anxiety [1] | The angry/irritable dimension of ODD predicts emotional disorders; the defiant/vindictive dimension predicts CD. Comorbid ADHD = higher risk of progression to CD | ODD straddles emotional and behavioural pathology. The comorbidity pattern predicts the developmental trajectory |

---

### E. Long-Term Systemic Complications

Child psychiatric conditions don't just affect the child — they affect the entire system:

| Level | Complication |
|---|---|
| **Family** | Parental stress, burnout, marital discord, sibling neglect (parental attention monopolised by the affected child), financial burden (therapy costs, lost work days), parental mental health deterioration |
| **School** | Teacher stress, classroom disruption affecting other students, resource allocation to SEN support |
| **Healthcare system** | Overuse of A&E for behavioural crises, repeated investigations for somatic complaints in somatising children, polypharmacy costs |
| **Society** | Juvenile delinquency, criminal justice costs, welfare dependency, lost productivity, intergenerational transmission of adversity (children of parents with untreated psychiatric conditions are at higher risk themselves) |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Complications of Child Psychiatric Conditions — Key Points:**

1. **ADHD**: Age-dependent ↓ severity (hyperactivity > impulsivity > inattention), but ~50% retain criteria in adolescence and 40–60% have problems in adulthood. Key complications: academic failure, peer rejection, substance abuse, injuries, ODD/CD cascade, adult occupational failure and relationship problems. Treating ADHD with stimulants **reduces** later substance abuse risk.

2. **ASD**: Core symptoms tend to improve but only a minority achieve independent adult living. Key complications: seizures (25%), psychiatric comorbidity (anxiety, depression, ADHD), autistic burnout from chronic masking, challenging behaviour, and exploitation.

3. **ODD/CD**: Developmental cascade — ODD → CD → antisocial PD. Prognosis worse for early-onset (40% antisocial behaviour vs 20% in adolescent-onset). Complications include substance abuse, criminal behaviour, teenage pregnancy, educational failure.

4. **Childhood anxiety**: 2/3 improve in 3–5 years, but 1/3 develop other anxiety disorders (heterotypic continuity). Untreated anxiety leads to academic underperformance, social isolation, adult anxiety/depression, and substance abuse.

5. **Youth depression**: Episodic relapsing course. Key complications: suicide (leading cause of adolescent death), self-harm, substance abuse, recurrence, social harm. 25% may convert to bipolar disorder.

6. **Iatrogenic complications**: Stimulant growth suppression, SSRI suicidality risk in first 2 weeks, antipsychotic metabolic syndrome and hyperprolactinaemia, lithium toxicity, valproate teratogenicity. Also: labelling effects, parental guilt, assessment delays.

7. **Comorbidity is itself a complication**: Each comorbid condition worsens prognosis multiplicatively. Always screen for and treat comorbidities.
