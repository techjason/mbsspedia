## 1. Definition and Overview

Eating disorders are a group of psychiatric conditions characterised by **persistent disturbances in eating behaviour** and related thoughts/emotions that significantly impair physical health and psychosocial functioning. They share a **distinctive core psychopathology: over-evaluation of weight and shape**, where patients judge their self-worth largely — or even exclusively — in terms of their body shape, weight, and their ability to control them [1][2].

Let's break the term down:
- "Eating" = obviously about food intake
- "Disorder" = a disruption of normal function

But the name undersells it. These are not simply "problems with food." They are severe neuropsychiatric illnesses with the **highest mortality of any psychiatric disorder class** (in the case of anorexia nervosa), driven by complex gene-environment interactions, neurobiological dysfunction, and powerful cognitive distortions [2].

<Callout title="Core Psychopathology — The Unifying Feature">
All eating disorders share an **over-evaluation of weight and shape**: patients define their self-worth almost entirely by their ability to control weight, shape, and eating. This is the engine that drives restrictive eating, binge eating, and compensatory behaviours. If you understand this one concept, the rest of the clinical picture falls into place logically.
</Callout>

> **Key principle:** Individuals often migrate between diagnostic categories (AN → BN → OSFED and back). This suggests they share a **common underlying pathophysiology**, and the boundaries between them are largely arbitrary — think of them as a spectrum rather than discrete boxes [2].

## 2. Epidemiology

### 2.1 Anorexia Nervosa (AN)

- **Incidence:** 4–5 per 100,000 population per year [2]
- **Prevalence:** ~250 per 100,000 in females vs ~22 per 100,000 in males; approximately **0.5–1% of females aged 13–35 years** [2]
- **Hong Kong data:** Disordered eating (subthreshold) is present in **3.9% of males and 6.5% of females aged 10–21 years** — this is a significant reservoir of at-risk individuals [2]
- **Sex ratio:** F:M ≈ **10:1** — male AN is often underreported and stigmatised [2]
- **Age of onset:** Usually within a few years of menarche; **40% onset between 15–19 years**. AN is the **3rd most common chronic illness in teenage girls** (after obesity and asthma) [2]
- **Culture-bound:** Lower prevalence in non-industrialised countries and among African-Americans; higher in Western/Westernised societies [2]
- **Occupational risk:** Prevalence of **4–6% among models and ballet dancers** [2]
- **Comorbidities:** Anxiety disorders, OCD, body dysmorphic disorder, depressive disorders (3/4 with lifetime history), PTSD, substance abuse disorders [2]
- **Mortality:** ***Highest mortality of ALL psychiatric disorders***
  - Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR): **23.14×** [2]
  - Average age at death: **34 years**
  - Major causes of death: **suicide (32%), anorexia itself (19%), cancer (11%)** [2]

### 2.2 Bulimia Nervosa (BN)

- **Incidence:** ~12 per 100,000 per year [2]
- **Prevalence:** ~1,000 per 100,000 in females; **2–5% of females aged 13–35 years** [2]
- **Sex ratio:** F:M ≈ **10:1** [2]
- **Mean onset:** ~18 years, with **30% having prior AN** and **one-third prior obesity** [2]
- **Comorbidities:** Depression (50%), anxiety disorders/OCD, substance abuse, impulsivity, borderline personality disorder [2]

### 2.3 Binge Eating Disorder (BED)

- **Prevalence:** ~2–3.5% lifetime; the **most common eating disorder overall**
- **Sex ratio:** More equal than AN/BN — approximately F:M ≈ 3:2
- **Strong association with obesity:** Found in 20–30% of patients seeking weight-loss treatment
- **Comorbidities:** Mood disorders, anxiety disorders, metabolic syndrome

### 2.4 Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders (OSFED)

- OSFED (previously "Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified" / EDNOS) accounts for the **majority of eating disorder presentations — 50–70%** [2]

<Callout title="Hong Kong Context" type="idea">
While classical AN with fat-phobia is the textbook presentation, studies from Hong Kong and other Asian populations have noted a subset of AN patients who **lack fat-phobia** ("non-fat-phobic AN") and instead attribute food restriction to epigastric bloating, loss of appetite, or other somatic complaints. This is important for clinical recognition in the local population.
</Callout>

## 3. Classification

The DSM-5 and ICD-11 both classify eating disorders, but the DSM-5 framework is the one most heavily examined [2]:

| **DSM-5 Feeding and Eating Disorders** | **ICD-10/11 Equivalents** |
|---|---|
| Anorexia Nervosa | Anorexia Nervosa |
| Bulimia Nervosa | Bulimia Nervosa |
| Binge Eating Disorder | Binge Eating Disorder (ICD-11) |
| Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) | Atypical Anorexia Nervosa |
| Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED) | Atypical Bulimia Nervosa |
| Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder | Other eating disorders (e.g. pica) |
| Pica | Eating disorder, unspecified |
| Rumination Disorder | — |

### Subtypes of AN (DSM-5)

1. **Restricting type:** Weight loss accomplished primarily through dieting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise — no recurrent binge-eating or purging in the last 3 months
2. **Binge-eating/Purging type:** Recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behaviour (self-induced vomiting, laxative/diuretic misuse) during the last 3 months

### Severity Specifiers

**AN severity** — based on BMI:
| Severity | BMI (kg/m²) |
|---|---|
| Mild | ≥ 17 |
| Moderate | 16–16.99 |
| Severe | 15–15.99 |
| Extreme | < 15 |

**BN severity** — based on frequency of compensatory behaviours per week:
| Severity | Compensatory behaviours/week |
|---|---|
| Mild | 1–3 |
| Moderate | 4–7 |
| Severe | 8–13 |
| Extreme | ≥ 14 |

> **Important concept:** AN and BN are not static diagnoses. There is **considerable overlap and migration between categories** — a patient may begin with AN restricting type, develop binge-eating, transition to BN, and later meet criteria for OSFED. The underlying over-evaluation of weight and shape is the constant thread [2].

## 4. Anatomy and Function: Key Neurobiological Systems

To understand eating disorders, you need to understand three interacting systems:

### 4.1 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) Axis

- The **hypothalamus** is the master regulator of appetite, energy homeostasis, and reproductive function
- In starvation (as in AN), the hypothalamus shuts down non-essential functions to conserve energy:
  - **↓ GnRH pulsatility** → ↓ LH/FSH → **amenorrhoea** (females) / **loss of libido and impotence** (males) [2]
  - This is a functional, adaptive response to energy deficit — the body "decides" reproduction is not safe when starving
- **Why does amenorrhoea occur early?** Because GnRH pulsatility is exquisitely sensitive to energy balance — even modest caloric deficit can suppress it. This is why amenorrhoea can occur before dramatic weight loss is evident [2]

### 4.2 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis

- Starvation → chronic physiological stress → **↑ CRH → ↑ cortisol**
- Patients with AN have **elevated cortisol** and **dexamethasone non-suppression** (pseudo-Cushing's) [2]
- Hypercortisolaemia contributes to **osteoporosis**, immunosuppression, and mood disturbance

### 4.3 Serotonin (5-HT) and Dopamine (DA) Systems

- **Serotonin (5-HT):** Involved in satiety, mood regulation, impulse control, and anxiety
  - AN patients: **altered 5-HT function** — starvation reduces tryptophan (5-HT precursor) availability, but post-recovery 5-HT levels may actually be elevated, suggesting an underlying trait of heightened 5-HT activity that produces anxiety/obsessionality. Starvation may be an unconscious attempt to reduce this aversive state [2]
  - BN patients: **5-HT dysfunction** similar to that seen in depression and impulsivity disorders [2]
- **Dopamine (DA):** Involved in reward processing
  - AN patients: **altered DA reward signalling** — food may not generate normal reward signals, and patients may derive reward from self-denial instead
  - BN patients: **DA abnormalities** similar to addictive patterns — binge eating may temporarily activate DA reward pathways [2]

<Callout title="The Serotonin Starvation Hypothesis" type="idea">
Think of it this way: some individuals are born with overactive serotonin systems → they feel chronically anxious, perfectionistic, obsessional. Starvation reduces tryptophan → reduces serotonin → temporarily reduces anxiety. So **starvation becomes self-reinforcing** because it makes the patient feel calmer. This is why AN patients often describe feeling "better" when restricting — they are literally self-medicating their anxiety through caloric restriction. Recovery then feels aversive because serotonin function normalises and anxiety returns.
</Callout>

### 4.4 Appetite-Regulating Hormones

| Hormone | Normal function | Change in AN | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Leptin** (from adipose tissue) | Signals satiety; suppresses appetite | ↓↓ (due to ↓ fat mass) | ↓ Satiety signalling; drives hunger (which patients override cognitively) |
| **Ghrelin** (from stomach) | Stimulates appetite ("hunger hormone") | ↑↑ | Should increase appetite, but patients cognitively override this drive |
| **Peptide YY** | Signals satiety post-meal | ↑ (paradoxically) in some AN patients | May contribute to early satiety complaints |
| **Insulin** | Anabolic; promotes glucose uptake | ↓ (due to chronic caloric restriction) | Hypoglycaemia |
| **Growth hormone** | Growth and metabolism | ↑ (GH resistance in starvation) | ↓ IGF-1 → poor growth in pre-pubertal patients |

### 4.5 Reward and Interoception Circuits

- **Insula:** Processes interoceptive signals (hunger, fullness, disgust). Altered insular function in AN → poor recognition of hunger/satiety cues
- **Prefrontal cortex:** Cognitive control; in AN, excessive top-down cognitive control overrides normal appetitive drives
- **Ventral striatum:** Reward processing; altered in both AN (reduced food reward) and BN/BED (heightened food reward, reduced satiety)

## 5. Aetiology

Eating disorders result from **gene-environment interactions** — a complex interplay of biological vulnerability, psychological factors, family dynamics, and sociocultural pressures [2].

### 5.1 Biological Factors

#### 5.1.1 Genetics

- **Eating disorders are highly heritable:** 50–80% genetic influence [2]
- **Family studies:** ~12× risk for first-degree relatives of AN patients [2]
- **Twin studies:** MZ concordance rate = **55%** vs DZ = **24%** [2]
- **Mode of inheritance:** No single gene identified for AN; risk is transmitted via:
  - Temperamental traits (anxiety, perfectionism, obsessionality)
  - Shared heritability with OCD, schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders [2]
  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci on chromosomes 1 and 12, with overlap with metabolic traits (BMI, insulin resistance) — suggesting AN has both psychiatric AND metabolic genetic components

#### 5.1.2 Neurobiological Factors

- **5-HT dysfunction and DA abnormalities** (as detailed above) [2]
- **Negative affect due to imbalance between aversive (5-HT) and reward (DA) systems** → pathological eating as a maladaptive attempt to resolve this affect [2]

#### 5.1.3 Personality Traits

- **AN traits:** Harm-avoidant, neurotic, obsessional, anxious, perfectionistic, reward-dependent, low novelty-seeking, extreme ↓ self-esteem, less affective dysregulation, less impulsivity [2]
- **BN traits:** Also harm-avoidant, neurotic, anxious, perfectionistic — but **MORE impulsive, may exhibit borderline personality traits, greater affective dysregulation** [2]

> The personality profile tells you something about the neurobiology: AN patients have excessive cognitive control (prefrontal dominance), while BN patients have impaired impulse control (limbic/striatal dominance relative to prefrontal cortex).

### 5.2 Psychological Factors

#### 5.2.1 Cognitive Theories

- **Premorbid personality traits (anxious, perfectionistic)** → difficulty negotiating demands of adolescence → **pathological eating as a maladaptive attempt to struggle for control, sense of identity, and effectiveness** [2]
- **Pathological eating → neurobiological changes → ↑ negative affect → vicious cycle** [2]
- Think of the developmental trajectory:
  - Childhood: mild anxiety, perfectionism, obsessionality
  - Adolescence: puberty + brain development + stress + cultural pressures → neurobiological change
  - Vicious cycle: increased dysphoria, denial, perfectionism, obsessionality → either **poor outcome (chronic)** or **good outcome (recovered)** if the cycle is broken [2]

#### 5.2.2 Personal Factors

- **Childhood adversities:** Poor relationship with parents, parental psychiatric disorder, history of anxiety or depression, sexual or physical abuse [2]
- **Developmental risk factors:** Early onset puberty, prior elevated BMI, weight loss from physical illness [2]
- **Other personal factors:** Poor problem-solving skills, impulsivity (especially BN), fears about sexuality [2]

### 5.3 Family Factors

- **FHx of psychiatric illness:** Depression, alcoholism, eating disorder, substance abuse [2]
- **Disturbed family relationships:** Enmeshment, overprotectiveness, rigidity, lack of conflict resolution → development of AN may serve to "prevent dissent within family" [2]
- **Poor parenting:** Parental deprivation, sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse [2]

### 5.4 Societal Factors

- **General:** Dieting culture, social pressure on women, emphasis on thinness, role confusion, mixed messages on women [2]
- **Specific:** Typically in **highly competitive academic or social environments** [2]
- **Important nuance for AN:** AN patients typically have **no excess exposure to factors associated with dieting** — the problem is **how the individual reacts to dieting rather than dieting itself** [2]

### 5.5 Risk Factors for BN (Distinct from AN)

While sharing many risk factors with AN, BN has additional/distinct risk factors [2]:
- **General RFs for psychiatric disorders:** General genetic risk genes, FHx of depression, substance abuse, childhood adverse experiences (e.g., sexual abuse)
- **RFs for dieting:** ↑ exposure to factors promoting dieting, e.g., childhood/parental obesity, early menarche
- **Personal RFs:** Premorbid negative self-evaluation, parental problems (low contact, high expectations)

### 5.6 Precipitating Factors

Immediate precipitating factors are almost always **internal/external experiences of feeling out of control** [2]:
- **Onset of puberty (11–14 years):** Average gain of ~40 lbs with disproportionate fat ratio → body changes feel "out of control"
- **Life events:** Major life transitions, traumatic events, family difficulties
- **Onset of comorbid illness:** e.g., anxiety or depression
- **Weight loss through dieting and/or exercise** (the "gateway")

<Callout title="The 'Dieting Gets Out of Control' Narrative" type="idea">
The typical natural history of AN begins with an **ordinary effort at dieting** in adolescence. Then:
1. Dieting gets out of control: secrecy and lying about eating, continued weight loss after overshooting target, preserved hunger
2. AN "takes over": extreme fear of weight gain, total preoccupation with food and weight, loss of hunger, metabolism stabilises making further weight loss harder
3. Symptoms of starvation: cold intolerance, hypoglycaemia, dizziness, fatigue, anergia...

Understanding this trajectory helps you recognise early presentations before the illness becomes entrenched [2].

## 6. Pathophysiology of Physical Complications

This section explains **why** each physical complication occurs — connecting clinical features back to the underlying pathophysiology of starvation, purging, and metabolic derangement.

### 6.1 Starvation-Related Pathophysiology (Predominantly AN)

| System | Pathophysiology | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **Endocrine** | Chronic energy deficit → ↓ leptin → hypothalamic suppression of GnRH → ↓ LH/FSH | **Amenorrhoea** (F), **↓ libido/impotence** (M) [2] |
| **Endocrine** | Chronic stress → ↑ CRH → ↑ ACTH → ↑ cortisol; dexamethasone non-suppression | Pseudo-Cushing's; contributes to **osteoporosis**, mood disturbance [2] |
| **Endocrine** | Starvation → ↓ T3 (euthyroid sick syndrome); GH resistance → ↑ GH but ↓ IGF-1 | **Cold intolerance, bradycardia, dry skin**; growth retardation in children [2] |
| **Endocrine** | ↓ Insulin secretion in chronic caloric restriction | **Hypoglycaemia** [2] |
| **Metabolic** | Starvation → lipolysis → ↑ free fatty acids → hepatic cholesterol synthesis | **Hypercholesterolaemia** (paradoxical — patients are malnourished but have high cholesterol!) [2] |
| **Metabolic** | ↑ Dietary carotene relative to metabolic clearance (or ↑ intake of low-calorie carotenoid-rich vegetables) | **Raised serum carotene** → yellowish skin (carotenodermia) [2] |
| **Metabolic** | Intracellular phosphate depletion during chronic starvation; worsened during refeeding (see below) | **Hypophosphataemia** [2] |
| **Cardiovascular** | Chronic caloric restriction → ↓ cardiac muscle mass → ↓ cardiac output; vagal predominance | **Bradycardia, hypotension, peripheral cyanosis** |
| **Cardiovascular** | Electrolyte disturbances (especially ↓ K⁺, ↓ Mg²⁺) → altered cardiac repolarisation | **QT prolongation → risk of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death** [2] |
| **Haematological** | Starvation → gelatinous bone marrow transformation (fat replaced by mucopolysaccharide) → ↓ haematopoiesis | **Normocytic normochromic anaemia, mild leucopenia with relative lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia** [2] |
| **Skeletal** | ↓ Oestrogen + ↑ cortisol + ↓ IGF-1 + ↓ calcium/vitamin D intake → impaired osteoblast function, enhanced osteoclast activity | **Osteopenia and osteoporosis** (can be irreversible) [2] |
| **GI** | ↓ Autonomic tone + ↓ gut hormones → impaired gastric motility | **Delayed gastric emptying** → bloating, early satiety (reinforces restriction) [2] |
| **GI** | Chronic laxative misuse → damage to myenteric plexus | **Decreased colonic motility**, chronic constipation [2] |
| **GI** | Rapid, excessive refeeding or binge eating → gastric atony | **Acute gastric dilatation** (rare but potentially fatal) [2] |
| **Dermatological** | Starvation → hypothermia → compensatory lanugo hair growth | **Lanugo** — fine, downy hair on face, arms, trunk |
| **Neurological** | Starvation → cerebral atrophy (grey and white matter volume loss) | Cognitive impairment, ↓ concentration (partially reversible with refeeding) |
| **Renal** | Dehydration + ↓ GFR + electrolyte disturbances | **Pre-renal AKI**, electrolyte derangements |

### 6.2 Purging-Related Pathophysiology (BN > AN binge-purge subtype)

| Purging method | Pathophysiology | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-induced vomiting** | Loss of H⁺ and Cl⁻ in gastric acid → **metabolic alkalosis** with **hypokalaemia** (renal K⁺ wasting to compensate) and **hypochloraemia** | Electrolyte disturbances, cardiac arrhythmia [2] |
| **Self-induced vomiting** | Repeated exposure of teeth to gastric acid → dissolution of dental enamel | **Dental erosion** (perimolysis) — especially palatal surfaces of upper teeth [2] |
| **Self-induced vomiting** | Chronic parotid stimulation from repeated vomiting → sialadenosis (non-inflammatory parotid hypertrophy) | **Parotid enlargement** (bilateral, painless) [2] |
| **Self-induced vomiting** | Forceful retching → mucosal tear at gastro-oesophageal junction | **Mallory-Weiss tear** → haematemesis [2] |
| **Self-induced vomiting** | ↑ Intra-abdominal pressure → rupture of small vessels | **Epistaxis, subconjunctival haemorrhage** [2] |
| **Self-induced vomiting** | Chronic acid exposure to oesophageal mucosa | **GERD, oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus (long-term)** [2] |
| **Self-induced vomiting** | Dorsal hand repeatedly hitting upper teeth during gag reflex | **Russell's sign** — calluses/scarring on dorsum of hand |
| **Laxative misuse (stimulant)** | Stimulant laxatives → ↑ colonic water and electrolyte secretion → loss of Na⁺, K⁺, and HCO₃⁻ | **HypoNa⁺, hypoK⁺, metabolic acidosis** [2] |
| **Laxative misuse (stimulant)** | Chronic stimulant laxative use → lipofuscin deposition in colonic mucosa | **Melanosis coli** [2] |
| **Laxative misuse (stimulant)** | Damage to myenteric plexus ("cathartic colon") | **Chronic constipation** (paradoxically worsened) [2] |
| **Diuretic misuse** | ↑ Renal excretion of Na⁺, K⁺, water | **Dehydration, hypoNa⁺, hypoK⁺** |

<Callout title="Vomiting = Alkalosis, Laxatives = Acidosis" type="error">
A common exam trap: **self-induced vomiting** causes **metabolic alkalosis** (loss of gastric HCl), while **stimulant laxative misuse** causes **metabolic acidosis** (loss of bicarbonate-rich intestinal secretions). If you see a purging patient with acidosis, think laxatives; if alkalosis, think vomiting [2].

## 7. Clinical Features

### 7.1 Anorexia Nervosa — Symptoms

Every symptom can be traced back to either (a) the core psychopathology, (b) starvation, or (c) compensatory behaviours.

#### A. Core Psychopathological Symptoms

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Intense fear of gaining weight / becoming fat** | Core over-evaluation of weight and shape; maintained by cognitive distortions (black-and-white thinking, catastrophising about weight gain) [2] |
| **Strong desire to become thin** | Ego-syntonic belief that thinness = worth, control, identity [2] |
| **Disturbance in body image** — feeling "fat" despite being objectively underweight | Perceptual distortion (altered body representation in parietal cortex and insula) + cognitive bias (selective attention to perceived "fat" areas) [2] |
| **Persistent lack of recognition of seriousness** of low body weight (poor insight/anosognosia) | Ego-syntonic nature of AN; cognitive rigidity; possibly related to altered interoception (impaired insular function) [2] |
| **Undue influence of body weight/shape on self-evaluation** | The defining cognitive distortion — self-worth = weight/shape control [2] |
| **Preoccupation with food** — cooking elaborate meals for others, collecting recipes, hoarding food | Starvation itself drives obsessive thoughts about food (demonstrated in Keys' Minnesota Starvation Experiment); paradoxical food-related behaviours reflect both cognitive preoccupation and possible vicarious satisfaction [2] |

#### B. Starvation-Related Symptoms

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Amenorrhoea** (females) / **↓ libido, impotence** (males) | HPG axis suppression (↓ GnRH pulsatility → ↓ LH/FSH → ↓ oestrogen/testosterone) secondary to energy deficit. Occurs **early** in the illness — often before dramatic weight loss [2] |
| **Cold intolerance** | ↓ Basal metabolic rate + ↓ subcutaneous fat insulation + hypothyroidism (sick euthyroid syndrome: ↓ T3) |
| **Fatigue, anergia, weakness** | Chronic caloric deficit → ↓ glycogen stores → ↓ available ATP; also muscle wasting |
| **Dizziness, lightheadedness** | Orthostatic hypotension (↓ cardiac output + ↓ intravascular volume) + hypoglycaemia [2] |
| **Constipation** | ↓ Colonic motility (↓ autonomic tone + ↓ food volume to stimulate peristalsis); worsened by chronic laxative misuse [2] |
| **Bloating, early satiety** | Delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis of starvation) [2] |
| **Depression, anxiety, irritability, labile mood** | Multifactorial: 5-HT/DA dysfunction from starvation, social isolation, chronic stress, hypercortisolaemia [2] |
| **Obsessional symptoms** (about food, weight, exercise, rituals) | Starvation amplifies pre-existing obsessional traits; 5-HT dysfunction |
| **Social withdrawal** | Combination of depression, food-related anxiety in social situations, and ego-syntonic avoidance |
| **↓ Concentration, cognitive impairment** | Cerebral atrophy from starvation + hypoglycaemia + electrolyte disturbance |
| **Insomnia** | Hypercortisolaemia + hunger + anxiety |

#### C. Behavioural Symptoms

| Symptom | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Self-induced weight loss** by limiting energy intake (often 600–1000 kcal/day) | Deliberate caloric restriction driven by core psychopathology [2] |
| **Purging behaviour:** self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives/diuretics/enemas | Compensatory behaviour to "undo" perceived caloric intake [2] |
| **Excessive exercising** | Compulsive caloric expenditure; often ritualistic and distressing if prevented |
| **Binge eating** (in binge-eating/purging subtype) | Increases in frequency with chronicity and age; typical binge involves eating "forbidden" foods → intense guilt → compensatory purging [2] |
| **Food-related rituals** (cutting food into tiny pieces, eating very slowly, sorting foods) | Attempt to exert control; starvation-driven obsessionality |
| **Deliberate self-harm** | 22% lifetime risk; reflects comorbid depression, impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation [2] |

### 7.2 Anorexia Nervosa — Signs

#### A. General Appearance

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Abnormally low body weight:** BMI ≤ 17.5 kg/m² or ≥ 15% below expected weight; in children, failure to gain weight or grow | Chronic caloric deficit — the hallmark finding [2] |
| **Emaciated, cachectic appearance** | Severe muscle wasting + ↓ subcutaneous fat |
| **Lanugo hair** (fine, downy hair on face, arms, trunk) | Compensatory mechanism for hypothermia: the body grows fine hair to trap an insulating layer of warm air near the skin (similar to goosebumps) |
| **Dry, yellowish skin (carotenodermia)** | ↑ Serum carotene (from ↑ relative carotene intake in vegetable-heavy diets and ↓ metabolic clearance) [2] |
| **Hair thinning/alopecia** | Protein malnutrition → telogen effluvium (hair follicles shift prematurely to resting phase) |
| **Peripheral oedema** | Hypoalbuminaemia from malnutrition → ↓ oncotic pressure |

#### B. Cardiovascular Signs

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Bradycardia** (HR < 60 bpm, often < 40) | ↓ Metabolic demand → compensatory ↑ vagal tone; ↓ cardiac muscle mass |
| **Hypotension, postural hypotension** | ↓ Intravascular volume + ↓ cardiac output + ↓ autonomic response |
| **Peripheral cyanosis, cold extremities** | ↓ Cardiac output → peripheral vasoconstriction to preserve core temperature |
| **Cardiac arrhythmias** | Electrolyte disturbances (hypoK⁺, hypoMg²⁺) → QT prolongation → risk of torsades de pointes / VF [2] |

#### C. GI Signs

| Sign | Basis |
|---|---|
| **Abdominal distension** | Gastroparesis + constipation + possible acute gastric dilatation |
| **↓ Bowel sounds** | ↓ Colonic motility |

#### D. Musculoskeletal

| Sign | Basis |
|---|---|
| **Proximal myopathy** | Protein catabolism → skeletal muscle wasting |
| **Pathological fractures** | Osteoporosis from ↓ oestrogen + ↑ cortisol + ↓ calcium/vitamin D + ↓ IGF-1 [2] |

#### E. Neurological

| Sign | Basis |
|---|---|
| **↓ Deep tendon reflexes** | Electrolyte disturbance (hypoK⁺) + peripheral neuropathy from malnutrition |
| **Peripheral neuropathy** | Vitamin deficiency (B1, B6, B12) |

#### F. Signs Specific to Purging Behaviour

| Sign | Basis |
|---|---|
| **Russell's sign** — calluses/scarring on dorsum of hand | Repeated trauma from teeth during self-induced vomiting |
| **Parotid/salivary gland enlargement** (bilateral, painless) | Sialadenosis from chronic vomiting-induced stimulation [2] |
| **Dental erosion (perimolysis)** — especially palatal surfaces | Repeated acid exposure from gastric contents [2] |
| **Pharyngeal erythema** | Chemical irritation from repeated vomiting |

### 7.3 Bulimia Nervosa — Symptoms

BN is characterised by a **prototypic cyclic binging-purging behaviour** [2]:

#### A. Core Psychopathological Symptoms

- **Morbid dread of fatness** with **strict weight threshold** — the same core over-evaluation of weight and shape as AN [2]
- **Irresistible craving** for food → episodes of binge eating [2]
- May have a **history of AN (30%)** [2]

#### B. Binge Eating

- **Recurrent episodes of excessive eating of large amounts of food** [2]
- Associated with a **sense of loss of control** during the episode — the patient feels they "cannot stop eating or control what or how much they are eating" [2]
- **Precipitated by:** Stress, breaking of self-imposed dietary rules (the "abstinence violation effect" — one bite of "forbidden food" → catastrophic thinking → "I've already blown it" → full binge) [2]
- **Consequence:** Initially feel **relief from tension** → soon followed by **guilt and disgust** → drives compensatory behaviour [2]

#### C. Compensatory Behaviour

- **Purging:** Self-induced vomiting, laxative/diuretic/appetite suppressant use [2]
- **Non-purging:** Fasting, excessive exercise [2]

#### D. The Vicious Cycle of BN

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Strict Diet"] --> B["Tension / Hunger"]
    B --> C["Craving"]
    C --> D["Binge Eating"]
    D --> E["Shame & Disgust"]
    E --> F["Purging to Avoid Weight Gain"]
    F --> A
```

This cycle is self-perpetuating [2]:
1. Strict dieting → physiological and psychological tension/hunger
2. Craving builds until the patient succumbs
3. Binge eating → temporary relief from tension
4. Shame and disgust → compensatory purging
5. Purging → renewed strict dieting → back to step 1

#### E. Associated Psychiatric Symptoms

- **Depression** — very common; typically remits when BN is treated (suggesting it is secondary to the eating disorder rather than a primary comorbidity) [2]
- **Impulsivity** — may manifest as substance misuse, shoplifting, sexual disinhibition
- **Self-harm**

### 7.4 Bulimia Nervosa — Signs

- **Body weight is often normal or near-normal** — this is the key distinguishing feature from AN. Patients with BN may be slightly underweight, normal weight, or even overweight.
- **Parotid enlargement** (sialadenosis) — bilateral, painless [2]
- **Dental erosion** (perimolysis) — especially palatal surfaces of upper incisors [2]
- **Russell's sign** — calluses/scarring on dorsum of hand [2]
- **Subconjunctival haemorrhage, epistaxis** — from forceful retching (↑ venous pressure) [2]
- **Metabolic alkalosis** (from vomiting) or **metabolic acidosis** (from laxative abuse) [2]
- **Electrolyte disturbances:** HypoK⁺ (most dangerous — can cause fatal arrhythmia), hypoNa⁺, hypoCl⁻ [2]
- **Mallory-Weiss tear** — presents as haematemesis after forceful retching [2]
- **GERD symptoms** — heartburn, oesophagitis [2]
- **Melanosis coli** — brownish discolouration of colonic mucosa from chronic stimulant laxative use [2]

### 7.5 Binge Eating Disorder — Clinical Features

- **Recurrent episodes of binge eating** (same definition as in BN: large amounts of food in a discrete period, with loss of control)
- **WITHOUT recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviours** — this is the critical distinction from BN
- Associated features during binge episodes:
  - Eating much more rapidly than normal
  - Eating until uncomfortably full
  - Eating large amounts when not physically hungry
  - Eating alone due to embarrassment
  - Feeling disgusted, depressed, or very guilty afterward
- **Marked distress** regarding binge eating
- **Frequency:** At least once per week for 3 months (DSM-5)
- Patients are often **overweight or obese** but not all obese patients have BED

### 7.6 Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)

- **Not driven by body image concerns** — this is the key distinction from AN
- Instead, restriction is driven by:
  - **Sensory sensitivity** (texture, colour, smell of food)
  - **Fear of aversive consequences** (e.g., choking, vomiting)
  - **Apparent lack of interest in eating or food**
- Can present at any age (including young children)
- Can lead to significant nutritional deficiency, weight loss, growth failure

<Callout title="AN vs ARFID — The Body Image Test" type="error">
Both AN and ARFID present with low weight and food restriction. The differentiator is the **motivation**: AN patients restrict because of over-evaluation of weight/shape and fear of fatness. ARFID patients restrict for entirely different reasons (sensory aversion, fear of choking, lack of appetite) with **no body image distortion**. This is a common exam distinction.

## 8. Approach to Assessment

Patients with eating disorders are often **ambivalent or reluctant** about seeking help — the illness is often ego-syntonic (especially AN). An empathic, non-judgmental approach is essential [2].

### 8.1 History Taking Framework

| Domain | Key Questions |
|---|---|
| **Eating History** | Typical day of eating? Mealtime arrangements? Any hunger? What foods are avoided and why? Calorie counting? Food rituals? [2] |
| **Weight and Shape Concerns** | How do you feel about your weight/shape? What would happen if you gained 1–2 kg? How often do you weigh yourself? |
| **Compensatory Behaviours** | Self-induced vomiting? Laxative/diuretic use? Excessive exercise? Fasting? |
| **Binge Eating** | Episodes of eating large amounts? Sense of loss of control? Frequency? Triggers? |
| **Weight History** | Highest/lowest weight? Rate of weight loss? Growth chart (children)? |
| **Menstrual History** | Regular periods? Amenorrhoea? Age at menarche? |
| **Psychiatric Comorbidities** | Depression? Anxiety? OCD? Self-harm? Suicidal ideation? Substance use? |
| **Past History** | Previous eating disorder episodes? Previous treatment? Medical complications? |
| **Family History** | FHx of eating disorders, depression, alcoholism, substance abuse? |
| **Developmental/Social History** | Childhood adversities? Sexual/physical abuse? Family dynamics? Academic/social pressures? |

### 8.2 Physical Examination

- **Vitals:** Weight, height, BMI, heart rate (look for bradycardia), blood pressure (look for orthostatic hypotension), temperature (hypothermia)
- **General:** Cachexia, lanugo, dry skin, carotenodermia, peripheral oedema, hair thinning
- **Oral cavity:** Dental erosion, parotid enlargement, pharyngeal erythema
- **Hands:** Russell's sign, peripheral cyanosis
- **Cardiovascular:** Bradycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension
- **Abdominal:** Distension, ↓ bowel sounds
- **Musculoskeletal:** Proximal myopathy, tenderness over bones (fractures)

### 8.3 Investigations

| Investigation | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **FBC** | Anaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia (bone marrow suppression) [2] |
| **UEC (Urea, electrolytes, creatinine)** | HypoK⁺, hypoNa⁺ (most critical — life-threatening arrhythmia risk) [2] |
| **Calcium, magnesium, phosphate** | Hypophosphataemia (especially during refeeding), hypoMg²⁺ [2] |
| **Glucose** | Hypoglycaemia [2] |
| **LFTs** | Transaminitis (starvation-related hepatocellular damage, or refeeding) |
| **TFTs** | ↓ T3, normal/low TSH (sick euthyroid syndrome) |
| **Lipid profile** | Hypercholesterolaemia [2] |
| **Serum amylase** | ↑ (salivary amylase from parotid hypertrophy) — marker of vomiting |
| **Bone densitometry (DEXA scan)** | Osteopenia/osteoporosis [2] |
| **ECG** | Bradycardia, QT prolongation, U waves (hypoK⁺), arrhythmias [2] |
| **Urinalysis** | Specific gravity (dehydration), pH (metabolic alkalosis vs acidosis) |
| **Oestradiol / Testosterone, LH, FSH** | Hypogonadism [2] |

## 9. Course and Prognosis

### 9.1 Anorexia Nervosa

- **Onset:** Usually begins in adolescence following an **ordinary effort at dieting** [2]
  1. Dieting gets out of control: secrecy, lying, continued weight loss after overshooting target, preserved hunger
  2. AN "takes over": extreme fear of weight gain, total preoccupation with food/weight, loss of hunger, harder to lose weight as metabolism stabilises
  3. Symptoms of starvation: cold intolerance, hypoglycaemia, dizziness, fatigue, anergia [2]
- **Course:** Generally **fluctuating** with exacerbations and periods of partial remission [2]
- **Prognosis:** Earlier treatment (< 15 years old) → better outcomes [2]
  - **Adolescents:** Excellent outcomes with family-based treatment → **60% well at 1 year, 90% well at 5 years** [2]
  - **Adults:** Different psychotherapy (mainly individual) better than specialist or dietary treatment alone → **30% well at 1 year, 40–50% well at 5 years** [2]
- **Poor prognostic factors:** Onset before puberty or in adulthood, long history ( > 3 years), premorbid personality problems, comorbid substance abuse, childhood obesity, shorter duration of maintaining normal BMI [2]

### 9.2 Bulimia Nervosa

- **Prognosis:** Generally better than AN
- ~50% recover fully; ~30% have partial recovery; ~20% have chronic course
- Relapse is common, particularly in the first 2 years after treatment

## 10. Summary Table: AN vs BN vs BED

| Feature | AN | BN | BED |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Weight** | Significantly low (BMI ≤ 17.5) | Normal or near-normal | Often overweight/obese |
| **Core psychopathology** | Over-evaluation of weight/shape | Over-evaluation of weight/shape | Distress about binge eating |
| **Restriction** | Prominent | Present (between binges) | Not prominent |
| **Binge eating** | May be present (subtype) | Always present | Always present |
| **Compensatory behaviours** | May be present (subtype) | Always present | **Absent** |
| **Insight** | Often poor (ego-syntonic) | Usually better (ego-dystonic) | Variable |
| **Key metabolic risk** | Starvation, refeeding syndrome | Electrolyte disturbance from purging | Metabolic syndrome |
| **Mortality** | Highest of all psychiatric disorders | Lower than AN | Related to obesity complications |
| **Personality traits** | Rigid, perfectionistic, controlled | Impulsive, affectively dysregulated | Variable |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Core psychopathology** of all eating disorders: **over-evaluation of weight and shape** — self-worth = ability to control weight/shape/eating.

2. **AN epidemiology:** 3rd commonest chronic illness in teenage girls; F:M = 10:1; onset around menarche; **highest mortality of ALL psychiatric disorders** (SMR 23.14×); death from suicide (32%), starvation (19%), cancer (11%).

3. **AN is ego-syntonic** → poor insight; **BN is ego-dystonic** → better insight.

4. **Aetiology** = gene-environment interaction: 50–80% heritable; 12× risk in first-degree relatives; transmitted via temperamental traits (anxiety, perfectionism); precipitated by feeling "out of control" (puberty, life events).

5. **Starvation physiology:** HPG axis suppression → amenorrhoea; HPA activation → ↑ cortisol; ↓ T3 (sick euthyroid); bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia; osteoporosis (↓ oestrogen + ↑ cortisol); gelatinous marrow → pancytopenia; hypercholesterolaemia (paradoxical); hypoglycaemia.

6. **Purging: vomiting → metabolic alkalosis + hypoK⁺; laxatives → metabolic acidosis + hypoK⁺/Na⁺** — common exam trap!

7. **BN vicious cycle:** Strict diet → tension → craving → binge → guilt/disgust → purging → strict diet → repeat.

8. **AN vs ARFID:** Both have low weight + restriction. AN = fear of fatness/body image distortion. ARFID = no body image concern (sensory aversion, fear of choking, lack of interest).

9. **Severity specifiers:** AN = by BMI (mild ≥ 17, extreme < 15); BN = by compensatory behaviour frequency/week (mild 1–3, extreme ≥ 14).

10. **Prognosis:** Earlier treatment → better outcome. Adolescent AN with family-based treatment: 90% well at 5 years. Poor prognostic factors: late onset, long duration, personality problems, substance abuse.

      question: "What is the core psychopathology shared by all eating disorders, and why does it drive both restrictive and binge-purge behaviours?",
      markscheme: "Over-evaluation of weight and shape: patients judge self-worth predominantly by their ability to control weight, shape, and eating. This drives restriction (to lose weight), compensatory purging (to prevent weight gain after eating), and distress about binge eating (perceived loss of control)."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain why anorexia nervosa patients develop amenorrhoea early in the illness, before dramatic weight loss is evident.",
      markscheme: "Chronic energy deficit leads to decreased leptin, which suppresses hypothalamic GnRH pulsatility. GnRH is exquisitely sensitive to energy balance, so even modest caloric deficit reduces LH/FSH secretion, leading to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and amenorrhoea before significant weight loss occurs."
    },
    {
      question: "A patient with bulimia nervosa presents with metabolic alkalosis and hypokalaemia. Another BN patient presents with metabolic acidosis and hypokalaemia. Explain the different mechanisms.",
      markscheme: "Metabolic alkalosis with hypoK: from self-induced vomiting (loss of HCl from stomach, renal K wasting to compensate for alkalosis). Metabolic acidosis with hypoK: from stimulant laxative misuse (loss of bicarbonate-rich intestinal secretions and potassium in diarrhoea)."
    },
    {
      question: "AN has the highest mortality of all psychiatric disorders. What is the SMR and what are the three leading causes of death?",
      markscheme: "SMR is 23.14 times general population. Leading causes: suicide (32%), anorexia/starvation complications (19%), cancer (11%). Average age at death is 34 years."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the serotonin starvation hypothesis explain why AN becomes self-reinforcing?",
      markscheme: "Patients with AN may have pre-existing overactive serotonin systems causing anxiety and obsessionality. Starvation reduces tryptophan availability, lowering serotonin, which temporarily reduces anxiety. This makes starvation self-reinforcing as patients feel calmer when restricting. Recovery restores serotonin function and anxiety returns, making recovery feel aversive."
    },
    {
      question: "Distinguish AN from ARFID in terms of the key motivational difference, body weight, and body image concerns.",
      markscheme: "Both present with low weight and food restriction. AN: restriction driven by over-evaluation of weight/shape, fear of fatness, body image distortion. ARFID: restriction driven by sensory sensitivity, fear of aversive consequences (choking/vomiting), or lack of interest in food, with NO body image disturbance or fat-phobia."
