## Complications of Eating Disorders

Complications of eating disorders arise from three mechanistic sources, and understanding which source drives which complication is the key to systematising this topic:

1. **Starvation** — the direct effects of chronic caloric deficit on every organ system (predominantly AN)
2. **Purging behaviours** — the damage caused by repeated vomiting, laxative abuse, or diuretic misuse (predominantly BN and AN binge-purge subtype)
3. **Iatrogenic / treatment-related** — primarily **refeeding syndrome**, the most dangerous complication of treatment itself

Additionally, there are **psychiatric complications** (comorbidities that worsen or develop as a consequence of the eating disorder) and **long-term sequelae** that may persist even after recovery.

### 1. Mortality — The Overarching Complication

Before discussing organ-specific complications, the most important fact: **anorexia nervosa carries the highest mortality of ALL psychiatric disorders** [2].

| Parameter | AN | BN |
|---|---|---|
| **Standardised Mortality Ratio** | ***23.14×*** general population [2] | 2–8× general population [2] |
| **Average age at death** | ***34 years*** [2] | Variable |
| **Major causes of death** | ***Suicide (32%), anorexia/starvation (19%), cancer (11%)*** [2] | Suicide (~1%), electrolyte-related cardiac death |
| **Suicide** | ***22% lifetime risk of DSH***; suicide is the leading cause of death [2] | Lower than AN but still elevated |

> **Why is suicide the leading cause of death in AN, not starvation itself?** Because AN is associated with profound comorbid depression, anxiety, hopelessness, social isolation, and treatment resistance. By the time patients reach critical BMI, many have endured years of suffering. The chronic neurobiological effects of starvation (5-HT dysfunction, hypercortisolaemia) also directly contribute to depression and suicidality.

### 2. Starvation-Related Complications (Predominantly AN)

These complications arise from chronic caloric deficit. The body systematically shuts down non-essential functions and cannibalises its own tissues for energy. Understanding the **order in which organ systems fail** at different BMI thresholds is clinically important for risk stratification [2]:

| BMI | Organ Systems Affected | Clinical Significance [2] |
|---|---|---|
| **17.5–20** (Underweight) | HPG axis: irregular/absent menstruation, ovulation failure | Fertility impaired; bone loss begins |
| **15–17.5** (AN range) | **All organs:** loss of substance from all body organs and structures; amenorrhoea established | Significant medical risk; outpatient management may still be possible |
| **13.5–15** (Severe AN) | **All organ systems compromised:** bone, heart, muscle, brain | High medical risk; consider day-patient or inpatient |
| **12–13.5** (Critical AN) | **Organs begin to fail:** marrow (cytopenias), muscle (cardiac/skeletal), heart (arrhythmia) | ***Inpatient treatment recommended*** [2] |
| **< 12** (Life-threatening AN) | **Imminent multi-organ failure** | ***Emergency inpatient; risk of death*** [2] |

#### 2.1 Cardiovascular Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bradycardia*** | ↓ Metabolic demand → compensatory ↑ vagal tone + ↓ cardiac muscle mass → ↓ heart rate | Usually asymptomatic until HR < 40 bpm → risk of haemodynamic instability, syncope, cardiac arrest. **Alert: HR < 40** [2] |
| ***Hypotension and postural hypotension*** | ↓ Intravascular volume (dehydration) + ↓ cardiac output + impaired autonomic vasoconstrictor reflex (autonomic neuropathy from starvation) | Dizziness, syncope, falls. **Alert: BP < 80/50, postural drop > 20 mmHg** [2] |
| ***QT prolongation*** | Electrolyte disturbances — **hypoK⁺, hypoMg²⁺, hypoCa²⁺** — delay ventricular repolarisation (phase 3 of the cardiac action potential requires K⁺ efflux; low extracellular K⁺ → slower efflux → prolonged repolarisation) | ***QTc > 450 msec → risk of torsades de pointes → ventricular fibrillation → sudden cardiac death*** [2]. This is the mechanism of sudden death in AN |
| ***Cardiac arrhythmias*** | Combined structural (myocardial fibrosis, ↓ cardiac mass) and functional (electrolyte-driven) substrate for re-entrant circuits and triggered activity | **Any arrhythmia = alert** [2]. Includes SVT, VT, VF, AF |
| **Mitral valve prolapse** | ↓ Left ventricular mass → the mitral valve leaflets become relatively too large for the shrunken ventricle → prolapse | Mid-systolic click, late systolic murmur. Usually benign and reversible with weight restoration |
| **Pericardial effusion** | Starvation-related serous fluid accumulation; mechanism unclear but related to hypoalbuminaemia and altered capillary permeability | Usually small and asymptomatic; rarely causes tamponade |
| **Heart failure during refeeding** | Rapid fluid/calorie reintroduction → insulin-mediated Na⁺/water retention → volume overload on a heart with reduced muscle mass and compliance → congestive cardiac failure | A refeeding complication (see section 4) |

<Callout title="Why Does AN Cause Sudden Cardiac Death?" type="error">
The lethal pathway is: **starvation → electrolyte depletion (K⁺, Mg²⁺) → QT prolongation → torsades de pointes → ventricular fibrillation → cardiac arrest**. This can happen at any time, even during sleep. It is why ECG and electrolyte monitoring are mandatory in severe AN, and why **any QT-prolonging medication is extremely dangerous** in this population [2].
</Callout>

#### 2.2 Endocrine and Metabolic Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Reversibility |
|---|---|---|
| ***Amenorrhoea*** **(F)** / ***↓ libido and impotence*** **(M)** | Chronic energy deficit → ↓ leptin → suppression of hypothalamic GnRH pulsatility → ↓ LH/FSH → **hypogonadotropic hypogonadism** → ↓ oestrogen (F) / ↓ testosterone (M) [2] | **Reversible** with weight restoration. Menses typically return at BMI ~19–20, though may take 6–12 months after weight restoration |
| **Infertility** | Anovulation secondary to HPG axis suppression | Reversible in most cases; fertility normalises after weight restoration, though may take time |
| ***↑ Cortisol and dexamethasone non-suppression*** | Starvation = chronic stress → ↑ CRH → ↑ ACTH → ↑ cortisol; also ↓ cortisol clearance | **Reversible** with weight restoration. Pseudo-Cushing's — must not be confused with true Cushing's syndrome |
| ***Hypoglycaemia*** | ↓ Hepatic glycogen stores from chronic caloric restriction → inability to maintain euglycaemia during fasting [2] | Immediate danger — can cause seizures, coma, death. **Alert: glucose < 2.5** [2] |
| ***Low T3 syndrome*** **(sick euthyroid)** | ↓ Peripheral conversion of T4 → T3 (adaptive mechanism to conserve energy by ↓ metabolic rate). TSH remains normal [2] | **Reversible** with weight restoration. Do NOT treat with thyroxine |
| ***↑ GH, ↓ IGF-1*** | GH resistance: GH is elevated but the malnourished liver cannot produce IGF-1 in response. In children → **growth failure and short stature** [2] | Growth may be permanently impaired if AN occurs during critical growth window (pre-pubertal/pubertal) |
| **Stunted growth and failure of breast development** | If onset is pre-pubertal: combined effect of ↓ IGF-1 (growth) + ↓ oestrogen (puberty) → pubertal delay or arrest [2] | Puberty usually completes normally with recovery, but **menarche is late** [2] |
| ***Hypercholesterolaemia*** | Paradoxical — malnourished patients have HIGH cholesterol because: starvation → lipolysis → ↑ free fatty acids → hepatic cholesterol synthesis; also ↓ LDL receptor expression and ↓ cholesterol clearance [2] | Reversible with weight restoration |
| ***↑ Serum carotene*** **(carotenodermia)** | ↑ Relative intake of carotene-rich vegetables (low-calorie foods) + ↓ metabolic clearance of carotene [2] | Reversible |
| ***Hypophosphataemia*** | Intracellular phosphate stores depleted in chronic starvation. Serum may appear normal until refeeding triggers precipitous intracellular shift. **Exaggerated during refeeding** [2] | Requires monitoring and supplementation, especially during refeeding |
| ***Dehydration*** | ↓ Fluid intake + ↓ insensible water losses are balanced, but purging behaviours or diuretic misuse can cause overt dehydration [2] | Correct cautiously to avoid fluid overload |
| ***Electrolyte disturbances*** | **HypoK⁺** (especially with vomiting or laxative/diuretic misuse), hypoNa⁺, hypoMg²⁺ [2] | Must be corrected urgently — hypoK⁺ is immediately life-threatening |

#### 2.3 Gastrointestinal Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Delayed gastric emptying*** **(gastroparesis)** | ↓ Autonomic tone (vagal dysfunction from starvation) + ↓ gut hormones → impaired gastric motility [2] | Bloating, nausea, fullness after eating, early satiety. **This perpetuates the eating disorder** — patients feel uncomfortably full after even small meals, which reinforces restriction |
| ***Decreased colonic motility*** | If chronic laxative misuse: damage to the myenteric plexus ("cathartic colon") → loss of intrinsic colonic motility [2] | Chronic constipation — paradoxically worsened by the laxatives that were supposed to treat it. Patients become dependent on laxatives for any bowel function |
| ***Acute gastric dilatation*** | Rare but potentially fatal. Occurs secondary to binge eating or excessive refeeding in a stomach with gastric atony [2] | Severe abdominal pain, distension, vomiting. Risk of gastric necrosis, perforation, death. This is why refeeding must be gradual |
| **Superior mesenteric artery syndrome** | Severe weight loss → loss of the mesenteric fat pad → the SMA compresses the third part of the duodenum between the SMA and the aorta | Postprandial vomiting, abdominal pain, early satiety. Diagnosed by CT angiography (reduced aortomesenteric angle). Resolves with weight restoration |
| **Constipation** | ↓ Food volume → ↓ mechanical stimulation of peristalsis; also ↓ autonomic tone | Common; often misinterpreted by patients as evidence they "don't need to eat" |

#### 2.4 Haematological Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Normocytic normochromic anaemia*** | Starvation → gelatinous bone marrow transformation (normal haematopoietic marrow replaced by gelatinous mucopolysaccharide ground substance) → ↓ erythropoiesis [2] | Fatigue, pallor, exercise intolerance |
| ***Mild leucopenia with relative lymphocytosis*** | Same gelatinous marrow transformation → ↓ myelopoiesis. Lymphocytes are relatively spared because they are long-lived and less dependent on marrow turnover [2] | **Neutropenia** → ↑ infection risk. **Alert criterion** [2]. Infections may present atypically (blunted inflammatory response) |
| ***Thrombocytopenia*** | Same mechanism — ↓ megakaryocyte production in gelatinous marrow [2] | Bruising, bleeding risk. Usually mild |

> **Why does the bone marrow become "gelatinous"?** In severe starvation, the body catabolises the fat that normally fills the bone marrow cavity. This fat is replaced by a mucopolysaccharide-rich gelatinous matrix that is hostile to haematopoietic stem cells. All three cell lines are affected, producing a **pancytopenia** pattern. This is fully reversible with nutritional rehabilitation.

#### 2.5 Musculoskeletal Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Osteopenia and osteoporosis*** | **Multifactorial:** (1) ↓ oestrogen → ↑ osteoclast activity (oestrogen normally suppresses RANKL and promotes OPG); (2) ↑ cortisol → ↓ osteoblast function; (3) ↓ IGF-1 → ↓ bone formation; (4) ↓ dietary calcium and vitamin D; (5) ↓ weight-bearing mechanical loading [2] | **Can develop within 6–12 months** of amenorrhoea. May be **partially irreversible** — peak bone mass may never be achieved if AN occurs during adolescence, leaving lifelong fracture risk. Pathological fractures can occur |
| **Proximal myopathy** | Protein catabolism → skeletal muscle wasting; also electrolyte derangement (hypoK⁺, hypoMg²⁺) → impaired muscle contraction [2] | Weakness — tested clinically with **squat test** (difficulty rising from squatting position) and **sit-up test** [2] |
| **Stress fractures** | Osteoporosis + excessive compulsive exercise | Common in exercising AN patients; may present atypically with minimal trauma |

<Callout title="Osteoporosis in AN — A Potentially Irreversible Complication">
Osteoporosis in AN is one of the few complications that may be **permanently disabling**. Adolescence is the critical window for achieving peak bone mass (which normally occurs by age ~25). If AN occurs during this window, peak bone mass may never be achieved, leaving the patient with lifelong increased fracture risk. **Weight restoration is the only proven treatment** — bisphosphonates are generally avoided in young women (teratogenic, very long half-life), and oestrogen replacement does NOT protect bone without concurrent weight restoration [2].
</Callout>

#### 2.6 Neurological and Neuropsychiatric Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Reversibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Cerebral atrophy** | Starvation → loss of grey and white matter volume (neuronal loss, myelin breakdown) | **Partially reversible** with weight restoration — grey matter recovers more than white matter. Some cognitive deficits may persist |
| **Cognitive impairment** | Cerebral atrophy + hypoglycaemia + electrolyte disturbance → ↓ concentration, ↓ processing speed, ↓ executive function, ↓ set-shifting ability | Largely reversible but cognitive rigidity (a premorbid trait amplified by starvation) may persist |
| **Peripheral neuropathy** | Vitamin deficiency (B₁, B₆, B₁₂) from malnutrition | Reversible with supplementation and nutritional rehabilitation |
| **Seizures** | Hypoglycaemia, hypoNa⁺, hypoMg²⁺ — all lower the seizure threshold | Treat underlying electrolyte/metabolic cause |

#### 2.7 Dermatological Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Lanugo hair** | Compensatory mechanism for hypothermia — fine, downy hair on face, back, arms traps an insulating layer of air near the skin [2] |
| **Dry skin** | ↓ Sebaceous gland activity from starvation; dehydration |
| **Orange discolouration of palms and soles** (carotenodermia) | ↑ Serum carotene [2] |
| **Hair thinning / alopecia** | Protein malnutrition → telogen effluvium (premature shift of hair follicles to resting phase) |
| **Acrocyanosis** (blue/purple discolouration of extremities) | Peripheral vasoconstriction to preserve core temperature |

#### 2.8 Renal Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Pre-renal AKI** | Dehydration → ↓ renal perfusion → ↑ urea, ↑ creatinine |
| **Chronic kidney disease** | Chronic dehydration + chronic hypoK⁺ → hypokalemic nephropathy (vacuolar degeneration of renal tubular epithelial cells → impaired concentrating ability → nephrogenic diabetes insipidus-like picture) |
| **Renal calculi** | Chronic dehydration → concentrated urine → ↑ stone formation |

---

### 3. Purging-Related Complications (Predominantly BN, AN Binge-Purge Subtype)

These are complications directly caused by the compensatory behaviours — self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, and diuretic misuse. They are the **primary source of morbidity in BN** (since BN patients are not typically in a starvation state) [2].

#### 3.1 Vomiting-Related Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Finding |
|---|---|---|
| ***Electrolyte disturbances*** | Loss of HCl (H⁺ and Cl⁻) in gastric acid → **metabolic alkalosis** with compensatory renal K⁺ wasting → **hypokalaemia + hypochloraemia** [2] | HypoK⁺ → QT prolongation, muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmia. The most dangerous acute complication |
| ***Parotid enlargement*** **(sialadenosis)** | Chronic stimulation of parotid glands by repeated vomiting → non-inflammatory hypertrophy (acinar cell enlargement). Bilateral, painless [2] | "Chipmunk facies" — bilateral parotid swelling giving a rounded facial appearance. ↑ Serum salivary amylase |
| ***Dental erosion*** **(perimolysis)** | Repeated exposure of dental enamel to gastric acid (pH ~1.5) → chemical dissolution of enamel, especially the **palatal surfaces of upper incisors** (directly bathed by vomitus) [2] | Sensitive teeth, dental caries, smooth-eroded enamel surfaces. **Irreversible** — enamel does not regenerate |
| ***Mallory-Weiss tear*** | Forceful retching → sudden ↑ intra-abdominal pressure → longitudinal mucosal tear at the gastro-oesophageal junction [2] | Haematemesis (bright red blood). Usually self-limiting but can cause significant haemorrhage |
| **Oesophageal rupture** (Boerhaave syndrome) | Extreme ↑ intra-oesophageal pressure during forceful vomiting → full-thickness oesophageal perforation | Surgical emergency — severe chest pain, subcutaneous emphysema, mediastinitis, sepsis. Rare but potentially fatal |
| ***GERD / Oesophagitis*** | Chronic acid exposure to oesophageal mucosa from repeated vomiting [2] | Heartburn, dysphagia. Long-term → Barrett's oesophagus → ↑ oesophageal adenocarcinoma risk |
| ***Epistaxis and subconjunctival haemorrhage*** | Forceful retching → ↑ venous pressure → rupture of small vessels in nasal mucosa and conjunctivae [2] | Nosebleeds, red eyes. Can be a clinical clue to secret purging |
| **Russell's sign** | Repeated trauma to the dorsum of the hand from teeth during self-induced vomiting (the hand is used to trigger the gag reflex) [2] | Calluses, scarring, abrasions on the knuckles (metacarpophalangeal joints). A pathognomonic sign |
| **Aspiration pneumonia** | Vomitus enters the trachea during self-induced vomiting | Cough, fever, dyspnoea. Chemical pneumonitis → bacterial superinfection |
| ***Metabolic alkalosis*** | Direct loss of HCl → ↑ serum HCO₃⁻ [2] | Blood gas: ↑ pH, ↑ HCO₃⁻, compensatory ↑ pCO₂ |

#### 3.2 Laxative-Related Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Finding |
|---|---|---|
| ***HypoNa⁺, hypoK⁺*** | Stimulant laxatives → ↑ intestinal secretion of water, Na⁺, K⁺ → osmotic diarrhoea with electrolyte losses [2] | Same dangers as vomiting-related hypoK⁺: cardiac arrhythmia, muscle weakness |
| ***Metabolic acidosis*** | Loss of bicarbonate-rich intestinal secretions (colonic bicarbonate loss) [2] | **Contrast with vomiting → metabolic alkalosis.** This is the distinguishing acid-base feature |
| ***Chronic constipation*** | Chronic stimulant laxative use → progressive damage to the myenteric plexus (Auerbach's plexus) → "cathartic colon" → loss of intrinsic colonic motility [2] | Paradoxically, the laxatives that were supposed to promote bowel function destroy the bowel's ability to function independently. Patients become laxative-dependent |
| ***Melanosis coli*** | Chronic stimulant laxative use (especially anthraquinone-based: senna, cascara) → lipofuscin deposition in colonic macrophages → brownish-black discolouration of colonic mucosa [2] | Seen on colonoscopy. Benign but a marker of chronic laxative abuse |
| **Rectal prolapse** | Chronic straining and ↓ pelvic floor muscle tone from repeated purgation | Protrusion of rectal mucosa through the anus |
| **Steatorrhoea and malabsorption** | Laxative-induced rapid transit → insufficient time for nutrient absorption | Weight loss (which paradoxically reinforces the behaviour), vitamin deficiencies |

#### 3.3 Diuretic-Related Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Dehydration** | ↑ Renal water excretion → volume depletion |
| **HypoK⁺, hypoNa⁺** | ↑ Renal excretion of K⁺ and Na⁺ (mechanism depends on specific diuretic — loop diuretics waste K⁺ and Na⁺; thiazides waste K⁺ and Na⁺ and cause hypoCa²⁺ retention) |
| **Pre-renal AKI** | Volume depletion → ↓ renal perfusion |
| **Pseudo-Bartter syndrome** | Chronic diuretic/laxative abuse → chronic volume depletion → activation of the RAAS → ↑ aldosterone → when the purging stops, the elevated aldosterone causes avid Na⁺/water reabsorption → **rebound oedema** → patient panics, thinks they are "gaining weight," resumes purging. This is a significant barrier to treatment cessation |

<Callout title="Pseudo-Bartter Syndrome — The Rebound Oedema Trap" type="idea">
When a patient with chronic purging stops vomiting or using diuretics/laxatives, they develop **rebound oedema** because chronic volume depletion has activated the RAAS (↑ renin, ↑ aldosterone). With cessation of purging, the kidneys avidly retain sodium and water → peripheral oedema and weight gain. This terrifies the patient, who may interpret the oedema as "getting fat" and resume purging. **Clinicians must warn patients about this in advance** and explain that the oedema is temporary (typically resolves within 1–2 weeks as RAAS activity normalises). Spironolactone can be used short-term to manage severe rebound oedema.
</Callout>

### 4. Iatrogenic / Treatment-Related Complications

#### 4.1 Refeeding Syndrome

This was covered in detail in the management section but deserves emphasis here as a **complication**:

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | A potentially fatal constellation of metabolic derangements occurring upon nutritional reintroduction in severely malnourished patients [2] |
| **Most characteristic finding** | ***Hypophosphataemia*** — phosphate plummets as insulin drives it intracellularly for glycolysis and ATP synthesis [2] |
| **Other electrolyte shifts** | HypoK⁺, hypoMg²⁺ (same insulin-driven intracellular shift) |
| **Fluid overload** | Insulin → renal Na⁺/water retention → oedema → **cardiac failure** in a heart with ↓ muscle mass and ↓ compliance |
| **Thiamine deficiency** | ↑ Glucose metabolism depletes thiamine stores → **Wernicke's encephalopathy** (confusion, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia) [2] |
| **Clinical manifestations** | Muscle weakness, seizures, peripheral oedema, **cardiac dysrhythmias**, hypotension, delirium [2] |
| **Prevention** | Thiamine supplementation BEFORE refeeding; start low go slow; daily PO₄/K⁺/Mg²⁺ monitoring; fluid restriction; prophylactic phosphate [2] |
| **Risk group** | BMI < 14, > 5 days of very low/absent caloric intake, pre-existing electrolyte disturbance |

#### 4.2 Refeeding Oedema

- Distinct from cardiac failure: **peripheral oedema** (especially lower limbs) during early refeeding due to insulin-mediated Na⁺/water retention
- Usually self-limiting; can be distressing to patients who interpret swelling as "getting fat"
- Management: reassurance, leg elevation, mild Na⁺ restriction; avoid diuretics unless cardiac failure

#### 4.3 Refeeding Hepatitis

- Transaminase flare (↑ AST/ALT) during early refeeding
- Mechanism: rapid carbohydrate provision → hepatic lipogenesis → steatosis → hepatocellular stress
- Usually self-limiting; monitor and slow refeeding rate if transaminases rise dramatically

---

### 5. Psychiatric Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Prevalence |
|---|---|---|
| ***Depression*** | Multifactorial: starvation-related 5-HT/DA dysfunction, chronic social isolation, hopelessness, hypercortisolaemia. In BN, depression is very common but typically **remits when BN is treated** (suggesting it is secondary) [2] | AN: **75% lifetime prevalence** [2]; BN: **50%** [2] |
| ***Anxiety disorders*** **(including OCD)** | Premorbid trait amplified by starvation; shared serotonergic neurobiology [2] | High comorbidity, especially OCD |
| ***Deliberate self-harm*** | ***22% lifetime risk*** in AN [2]. Associated with comorbid depression, impulsivity (especially BN), emotional dysregulation | Significant — must be screened for |
| **Suicide** | ***Leading cause of death in AN (32%)*** [2]. Risk factors: chronic course, comorbid depression, substance abuse, social isolation | Extremely high — higher than depression alone |
| **Substance abuse** | BN especially associated with impulsivity → higher rates of alcohol/drug misuse [2]. AN binge-purge subtype also at elevated risk | BN > AN restricting type |
| **Social withdrawal** | Depression, food-related anxiety in social situations, shame, secrecy | Almost universal in severe cases |
| ***Labile mood, obsessional symptoms*** | Starvation amplifies premorbid obsessional and affective traits; 5-HT dysfunction [2] | Common during active illness; may improve with weight restoration |

---

### 6. Long-Term Sequelae (Post-Recovery or Chronic Course)

| Sequela | Mechanism | Prognosis |
|---|---|---|
| **Permanent short stature** | If AN occurs pre-pubertally during the growth window → ↓ IGF-1 → irreversible growth impairment | Irreversible if growth plates have fused |
| **Permanent osteoporosis** | Failure to achieve peak bone mass during adolescence; chronic oestrogen deficiency and cortisol excess | **May be partially irreversible** — lifelong increased fracture risk |
| **Fertility issues** | Usually reversible with weight restoration, but prolonged amenorrhoea → may need assisted reproduction | Generally reversible |
| **Dental damage** | Enamel erosion from chronic vomiting is **irreversible** — requires dental restoration (crowns, veneers) | Irreversible |
| **Cardiac damage** | Prolonged starvation → myocardial fibrosis; may cause permanent ↓ cardiac function in severe cases | Partially reversible with weight restoration |
| **Cognitive deficits** | White matter changes may not fully recover | Partially reversible |
| **Cathartic colon** | Permanent damage to myenteric plexus from chronic laxative abuse → lifelong constipation | Irreversible |
| **Chronic kidney disease** | Chronic dehydration + chronic hypoK⁺ → hypokalemic nephropathy | May be irreversible |

---

### 7. Complications of Binge Eating Disorder

BED has a different complication profile because it lacks both starvation and purging:

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Obesity** | Recurrent binge eating without compensatory behaviours → chronic positive energy balance → weight gain |
| **Metabolic syndrome** | Obesity → insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, central adiposity |
| **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** | Insulin resistance from obesity → β-cell failure |
| **Cardiovascular disease** | Metabolic syndrome → atherosclerosis → MI, stroke |
| **Obstructive sleep apnoea** | Obesity → upper airway fat deposition → nocturnal airway collapse |
| **Depression and low self-esteem** | Shame about binge eating, weight stigma, perceived loss of control |
| **Osteoarthritis** | Mechanical loading from excess weight on weight-bearing joints |

---

### 8. Summary: Complications by Mechanism

| Mechanism | Key Complications | Most Dangerous |
|---|---|---|
| **Starvation** | Cardiac (bradycardia, QT prolongation, arrhythmia), endocrine (amenorrhoea, ↑ cortisol, hypoglycaemia), haematological (pancytopenia), skeletal (osteoporosis), neurological (cerebral atrophy), GI (gastroparesis) | **Sudden cardiac death from arrhythmia; hypoglycaemic seizure/coma** |
| **Vomiting** | Metabolic alkalosis, hypoK⁺, dental erosion, parotid enlargement, Mallory-Weiss tear, oesophageal rupture, aspiration pneumonia | **Hypokalemic cardiac arrhythmia; Boerhaave syndrome** |
| **Laxatives** | Metabolic acidosis, hypoK⁺/Na⁺, cathartic colon, melanosis coli | **Hypokalemic cardiac arrhythmia** |
| **Diuretics** | Dehydration, hypoK⁺/Na⁺, pre-renal AKI, pseudo-Bartter syndrome | **Hypokalemic cardiac arrhythmia; AKI** |
| **Refeeding** | Hypophosphataemia, hypoK⁺, hypoMg²⁺, fluid overload, Wernicke's encephalopathy | **Cardiac failure; cardiac arrhythmia; Wernicke's** |
| **Binge eating** (BED) | Obesity, metabolic syndrome, T2DM, CVD, OSA | **Cardiovascular disease** |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications">

1. **AN has the highest mortality of ALL psychiatric disorders** — SMR 23.14×; leading cause of death is **suicide (32%)**, then starvation (19%), then cancer (11%).

2. **Sudden cardiac death mechanism:** Starvation + electrolyte depletion (hypoK⁺, hypoMg²⁺) → QT prolongation → torsades de pointes → VF → cardiac arrest.

3. **BMI and organ failure:** BMI 13.5–15 = all systems compromised; BMI 12–13.5 = organs begin to fail (marrow, muscle, heart); BMI < 12 = life-threatening.

4. **Osteoporosis** may be **partially irreversible** — failure to achieve peak bone mass during adolescent AN = lifelong fracture risk. Weight restoration (NOT HRT, NOT bisphosphonates) is the treatment.

5. **Starvation endocrinopathy** (↓ T3, ↓ LH/FSH, ↑ cortisol, ↑ GH/↓ IGF-1) is adaptive and reversible with refeeding — do NOT treat with hormone replacement.

6. **Vomiting → metabolic alkalosis + hypoK⁺; laxatives → metabolic acidosis + hypoK⁺** — the acid-base difference is a classic exam question.

7. **Refeeding syndrome:** Hypophosphataemia is the hallmark; prevent with thiamine BEFORE refeeding, start low go slow, daily electrolyte monitoring.

8. **Pseudo-Bartter syndrome:** Chronic purging → RAAS activation → rebound oedema when purging stops → patient panics → resumes purging. Must warn patients in advance.

9. **Dental erosion** (perimolysis) from chronic vomiting is **irreversible** — enamel does not regenerate.

10. **Depression comorbidity:** 75% lifetime in AN, 50% in BN; in BN it often remits when the eating disorder is treated. Suicide risk is extremely high (22% lifetime DSH in AN).

If peak bone mass is never achieved, the deficit is permanent.
