## Complications of Alcohol Misuse and Alcohol-related Disorders

Alcohol is arguably the most damaging substance to the human body when used chronically — it affects virtually every organ system. The complications are best understood through the lens of **four overarching mechanisms of damage**:

1. **Direct cytotoxicity** — ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde are directly toxic to cell membranes, mitochondria, and DNA
2. **Nutritional deficiency** — chronic alcoholics eat poorly, absorb nutrients poorly (damaged GI mucosa), and alcohol directly interferes with vitamin metabolism (especially B1, B3, B6, B12, folate)
3. **Metabolic disruption** — the massive shift in hepatic NAD⁺/NADH ratio disrupts gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, the TCA cycle, and uric acid excretion
4. **Immune dysregulation** — chronic alcohol suppresses both innate and adaptive immunity → increased susceptibility to infections

Every complication below can be traced back to one or more of these four mechanisms. Let's work through each system.

### A. Acute Complications

#### 1. Acute Intoxication and Blackouts [2]

- Dose-dependent CNS depression (covered in detail in prior sections)
- **Alcoholic blackouts**: transient amnesia lasting hours, without impairment of conscious level; caused by NMDA receptor inhibition in hippocampus → failure of long-term potentiation (LTP) [2]
- **Traumatic brain injury**: falls during intoxication are extremely common; alcoholics have impaired balance (cerebellar), poor judgement (prefrontal), and impaired protective reflexes → head injuries → subdural haematoma (further compounded by coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia)

#### 2. Alcoholic Hypoglycaemia [2]

- Occurs 6–36h after ingestion of > 30g alcohol [2]
- Mechanism: alcohol metabolism consumes NAD⁺ → ↑↑ NADH:NAD⁺ ratio → insufficient NAD⁺ for gluconeogenesis → hypoglycaemia [2]
- Mimics intoxication exactly (confusion, aggression, stupor, hypothermia) → always check H'stix [2]

#### 3. Alcoholic Ketoacidosis [2]

- Occurs after a binge followed by fasting/vomiting → depleted glycogen stores + ↑ NADH:NAD⁺ ratio + ↑ free fatty acid mobilisation → ↑ ketone body production (β-hydroxybutyrate predominates over acetoacetate because of the shifted redox state)
- Presents with: anion-gap metabolic acidosis, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, tachypnoea (Kussmaul breathing)
- Glucose may be low, normal, or mildly elevated (unlike diabetic ketoacidosis where glucose is markedly elevated)
- Mx: IV fluids (NS with dextrose), thiamine, electrolyte correction

#### 4. Withdrawal Complications [1][2]

| Complication | Timeline | Key Features | Mortality |
|---|---|---|---|
| Withdrawal syndrome | 6–24h after last drink | Tremor, sweating, nausea, anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension [1] | Low if treated |
| Withdrawal seizures | 12–48h | Generalised tonic-clonic; risk of kindling [2] | Low if single; status epilepticus can be fatal |
| ***Delirium tremens*** [1] | ***24–96 hours of abstention*** [1] | ***Confusion, hallucination, severe agitation, seizure*** [1]. Autonomic storm | ***Mortality 5%*** [1]; < 5% if treated, up to 35% untreated |

### B. Chronic Neurological Complications

> ***Alcoholism affects the brain front (frontal dementia), back (cerebellar vermis) and centre (corpus callosum)*** [2] — this mnemonic elegantly captures the three major chronic brain lesions.

#### 1. Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome [1][2]

This is the single most important neurological complication to understand.

**Wernicke Encephalopathy (WE)** [1][2]:
- ***Mostly alcoholic / some non-alcoholic*** [1]
- ***Thiamine deficiency*** [1]
- ***Only 20% detected in life (Harper 1983)*** [1] — the classic triad is only present in ~10–16% of cases; most are diagnosed post-mortem
- ***Medical emergency*** [1]
- ***20% mortality*** [1]
- ***IM/IV Thiamine*** [1]
- ***Progression to Korsakoff's Psychosis in 84% (Victor 1989)*** [1]
- Clinical triad [2]:
  - **Encephalopathy**: delirium with profound disorientation, apathy, inattention, amnesia [2]
  - **Oculomotor dysfunction**: ophthalmoplegia (combination of bilateral palsies), nystagmus (most commonly horizontal but can be vertical), pupillary abnormalities (sluggish or unequal pupils) [2]
  - **Truncal ataxia**: vermis-type — ataxic, wide-based gait with short steps [2]
  - Other features: polyneuropathy (50%), hypothermia (1–4%), vestibular dysfunction, coma (rare) [2]
- **Diagnosis** [2]: Caine criteria (≥ 2 out of 4): dietary deficiency, oculomotor abnormalities, cerebellar dysfunction, altered mental state or amnesia [2]
- Imaging: T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in mammillary bodies, medial thalami, periaqueductal grey [2]
- **Course with treatment**: ocular signs improve within hours to days; confusion subsides in days to weeks [2]
- **Prognosis**: mortality 17% in acute stage; majority have residual deficits (nystagmus, ataxic gait, memory deficits) [2]

**Korsakoff Syndrome** [2]:
- Develops in 84% of untreated WE patients [1]
- **Profound anterograde amnesia** (inability to form new memories) with relative preservation of other cognitive functions
- **Confabulation** — fabricated memories to fill gaps (the brain's attempt to make narrative sense of missing data; not deliberate lying)
- **Retrograde amnesia** with temporal gradient (more recent memories lost preferentially)
- Pathology: bilateral mammillary body and medial thalamic nuclei damage — these are key nodes in the **Papez circuit** (hippocampus → fornix → mammillary bodies → mammillothalamic tract → anterior thalamus → cingulate cortex → hippocampus), which is the circuit for memory consolidation
- **Largely irreversible** — only ~20% show significant recovery even with thiamine supplementation

#### 2. Alcoholic Cerebellar Degeneration [2]

- **Pathogenesis**: nutritional deficiency + direct neurotoxicity → degeneration of Purkinje cells in cerebellar cortex → ***vermis atrophy*** [2]
- **S/S**: subacute/chronic onset of **ataxic gait** followed by other features of truncal ataxia [2]. Heel-shin test is usually abnormal with severe gait disturbances, but finger-nose testing may reveal only mild abnormalities [2] — why? Because the vermis controls midline/truncal coordination (gait, posture), while the lateral cerebellar hemispheres control limb coordination (finger-nose). Alcohol preferentially damages the vermis.
- ***A midline section of the cerebellum from a non-alcoholic (left) and an alcoholic (right) patient shows atrophy of the folia and widening of the sulci in the anterior superior aspect of the cerebellar vermis in the alcoholic patient*** [1]
- Course: stabilises with abstinence, but progresses with continued drinking [2]
- Dx: clinical + CT/MRI showing cerebellar cortical atrophy especially affecting anterior vermis [2]
- Mx: cessation of drinking and nutritional supplementation [2]

#### 3. Alcohol-related Dementia [2]

- Prevalence: ~50–70% of alcohol abusers have some degree of cognitive deficits [2]
- Pathophysiology: usually multifactorial — NOT solely attributed to ethanol use [2]
  - Aetiological factors: head injury, vascular changes, direct alcohol neuronal toxicity [2]
  - Light/moderate use may paradoxically lead to ↓ risk of dementia, especially in wine drinkers [2]
- **S/S**: cognitive impairment simulating **frontal lobe dementia** (the frontal lobes are more susceptible to alcohol damage) [2] — executive dysfunction, personality change, disinhibition, impaired planning
- ***Alcohol-induced neurological deficit*** [1]:
  - ***Impairment in visuospatial processing*** [1]
  - ***Memory impairment*** [1]
  - ***EEG abnormalities*** [1]
  - ***Reduction in cerebral blood flow*** [1]
  - ***Reduction in cerebral glucose metabolism*** [1]
- Dx: diagnosed ≥ 8 weeks after abstinence, based on multiple criteria (Oslin 1998, DSM-5) [2]
- Neuroimaging findings [2]:
  - Cerebral cortical atrophy with enlarged lateral ventricles
  - Loss of grey matter in cortical and subcortical areas
  - White matter changes with demyelination on DTI

#### 4. Stroke [1][2]

***Alcohol and stroke*** [1]:
- ***Haemorrhagic stroke (15% of all strokes): heavy drinking → ↑ risk*** [1]
- ***Ischaemic stroke (85%): light/moderate drinking → ↓ risk*** [1]
- Wine is associated with ↓ risk of stroke, but no such relationship for beer/spirits [2]

Why does heavy drinking increase haemorrhagic stroke risk? Multiple mechanisms: (1) chronic hypertension (alcohol activates the RAAS and sympathetic nervous system); (2) impaired coagulation (hepatic dysfunction → ↓ clotting factors + thrombocytopenia); (3) direct vascular endothelial damage from acetaldehyde.

Why might light/moderate drinking decrease ischaemic stroke risk? (1) ↑ HDL cholesterol; (2) ↓ platelet aggregation; (3) ↓ fibrinogen. However, this is **controversial** — current WHO guidance (2023) and recent large studies suggest there is **no safe level** of alcohol for overall health.

#### 5. Peripheral Neuropathy [2]

- Symmetric distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy — "stocking-glove" distribution
- Painful paraesthesiae, burning feet, ↓ ankle jerks, distal sensory loss
- Mechanism: direct neurotoxicity of ethanol + B-vitamin deficiency (B1, B6, B12) → axonal degeneration ("dying-back" neuropathy — the longest axons are most vulnerable because they depend most on axonal transport, which requires energy/nutrition)
- Affects up to 50% of chronic alcoholics

#### 6. Marchiafava-Bignami Disease [2]

- Rare demyelinating disorder of corpus callosum [2]
- Pathology: demyelination or necrosis of corpus callosum and adjacent subcortical white matter due to hypo-vitamin B (especially B₁) [2]
- S/S: usually in 40–60 y/o, with subacute onset of [2]:
  - **Frontal syndrome**: frontal dementia, personality changes
  - Others: seizures, spasticity, rigidity, paralysis, coma, death
- Neuroimaging: classically hypodense/vacuolation of corpus callosum with white matter lesions [2]
- Prognosis: variable — death, demented state, or recovery possible [2]

#### 7. Central Pontine Myelinolysis (Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome) [2]

- Cause: ***rapid correction of hyponatraemia*** in acute intoxication → demyelination of pons [2]
- S/S: spastic paralysis of 4 limbs, pseudobulbar palsy, personality changes, inappropriate affect, delusions; "locked-in" syndrome in severe cases [2]
- ***Prevention: never correct hyponatraemia quicker than ~10 mmol/24h*** [2]
- Why the pons? The basis pontis has a unique vascular supply (end-artery territory) and a high density of oligodendrocytes that are vulnerable to osmotic stress. Rapid Na⁺ correction → rapid water efflux from brain cells → oligodendrocyte shrinkage and apoptosis → demyelination

#### 8. Other Neurological Complications [2]

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***B12 deficiency*** [2] | Poor nutrition in chronic alcoholism | Subacute combined degeneration of cord, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, optic atrophy, dementia, depression, psychosis, delirium. ***Classically loss of ankle jerk (peripheral neuropathy) with ↑ knee jerk (SCD of cord)*** [2]. Require ~350 pg/mL for proper neurological function cf 200 pg/mL for haematological function [2] | IM cyanocobalamin 1 mg daily × 7 → 1 mg weekly × 4 → 1 mg monthly [2] |
| ***B3 deficiency (pellagra)*** [2] | Poor nutrition | 3Ds: **dementia, dermatitis, diarrhoea**; peripheral neuropathy; psychiatric changes (irritability, apathy, depression, cognitive impairment) [2] | Nicotinic acid 50 mg TDS PO [2] |
| ***Alcohol-tobacco amblyopia*** [2] | ***Heavy drinking + smoking → deficiency of thiamine or B12 → optic atrophy*** [2] | ***↓ VA with central scotoma and loss of colour vision*** [2] | Vitamin B12 supplementation [2] |

---

### C. Gastrointestinal Complications [2]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **Alcoholic liver disease** | Steatosis (↑ NADH → ↓ fatty acid oxidation) → Steatohepatitis (acetaldehyde-protein adducts → immune activation) → Fibrosis → Cirrhosis (stellate cell activation → collagen) → HCC | Progressive spectrum; cirrhosis is irreversible; HCC screening needed |
| **Oesophageal varices** | Cirrhosis → portal hypertension → portosystemic collateral formation at oesophageal submucosal veins | Risk of catastrophic upper GI bleed; mortality ~20% per episode |
| **Mallory-Weiss tear** | Forceful vomiting (common in alcoholics) → mucosal tear at gastro-oesophageal junction | Upper GI bleed; usually self-limiting |
| **Gastritis / PUD** | Direct mucosal irritation by ethanol; ↑ gastric acid secretion; impaired mucosal defences | Epigastric pain, haematemesis |
| **Acute pancreatitis** | Alcohol is the 2nd commonest cause (after gallstones in HK). Mechanism: premature activation of pancreatic enzymes + direct acinar cell toxicity by ethanol/acetaldehyde | Severe epigastric pain radiating to back; ↑ amylase/lipase |
| **Chronic pancreatitis** | Repeated inflammation → protein plug formation in ducts → calcification → exocrine/endocrine failure | Chronic pain, steatorrhoea, diabetes mellitus |
| **Malabsorption** | Damaged intestinal mucosa + pancreatic exocrine failure + biliary dysfunction | Contributes to all nutritional deficiencies |
| **GI malignancies** | Acetaldehyde is a **Group 1 carcinogen** (IARC) — directly damages DNA and impairs DNA repair | ↑ Risk of oropharyngeal, laryngeal, oesophageal cancers (synergistic with smoking) |

---

### D. Cardiovascular Complications [2]

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Alcoholic cardiomyopathy** | Direct myocardial toxicity from ethanol and acetaldehyde → myocyte apoptosis → dilated cardiomyopathy | Progressive heart failure (dyspnoea, oedema, fatigue); partially reversible with abstinence |
| **Atrial fibrillation ("Holiday Heart")** | Binge drinking → direct electrophysiological effects on atrial myocytes + autonomic surge (↑ sympathetic, ↓ vagal) → triggered AF | Often self-terminating; recurrent if binge pattern continues |
| **Hypertension** | Chronic sympathetic activation + RAAS activation + direct vascular effects | Dose-dependent; ↓ with abstinence |
| **Ischaemic heart disease** | Complex relationship — light/moderate drinking may be protective (↑ HDL, ↓ platelet aggregation) but heavy drinking is harmful (hypertension, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia) | J-shaped curve; controversial |

---

### E. Haematological Complications [2]

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Macrocytosis without anaemia** | Direct toxic effect on erythroblast membranes (↑ membrane fluidity → ↑ cell size) + folate deficiency | ↑ MCV is often the first clue to occult heavy drinking |
| **Megaloblastic anaemia** | Folate deficiency → impaired DNA synthesis | Macro-ovalocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils |
| **Sideroblastic anaemia** | Alcohol inhibits δ-aminolaevulinic acid synthase (the first enzyme in haem synthesis) | Ring sideroblasts on bone marrow |
| **Thrombocytopenia** | Direct marrow suppression + hypersplenism (portal hypertension → splenomegaly → sequestration) | ↑ Bleeding risk; typically corrects with abstinence |
| **Compromised immunity** | Alcohol impairs neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, T-cell function, and cytokine production | ↑ Risk of pneumonia, TB, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis |
| **Zieve syndrome** | Rare triad: haemolytic anaemia + jaundice + hyperlipidaemia in the setting of alcoholic liver disease | Haemolysis due to altered RBC membrane lipids |

---

### F. Endocrine and Metabolic Complications [2]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Hypoglycaemia** | ↑ NADH:NAD⁺ ratio → blocked gluconeogenesis [2] |
| **Pseudo-Cushing syndrome** | Chronic alcohol → ↑ CRH and ACTH → ↑ cortisol. Features mimic Cushing's but resolve with abstinence |
| **Electrolyte disturbance** | HypoK⁺ (GI losses + renal wasting), hypoNa⁺ (beer potomania, SIADH), hypoMg²⁺ (poor intake + renal wasting), hypoPO₄³⁻ (refeeding shifts, poor intake) [2] |
| **Hypogonadism** | ↑ Aromatisation of androgens → oestrogens in cirrhotic liver + direct gonadal toxicity → gynaecomastia, testicular atrophy, impotence, infertility [2] |
| **Alcoholic ketoacidosis** | Binge → fasting → ↑ NADH + ↑ free fatty acids → ↑ ketone bodies |

---

### G. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders [1]

***Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)*** [1]:
- ***Heavy drinking → 30% risk*** [1]
- ***1–4 per 1000 live births in the US*** [1]
- ***Microcephaly*** [1]
  - ***Agenesis of corpus callosum*** [1]
  - ***Cerebellar hypoplasia*** [1]
- ***Most common cause of preventable mental retardation*** [1]
- ***Low birth weight*** [1]
- ***Facial dysmorphology*** [1] — smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, short palpebral fissures (the classic "FAS facies")
- ***Growth retardation*** [1]

Why does alcohol cause these effects? Ethanol freely crosses the placenta and the fetal BBB. The fetus has very low ADH and ALDH activity → cannot metabolise ethanol efficiently → prolonged exposure. Ethanol disrupts neural crest cell migration (→ facial features), neuronal proliferation and migration (→ microcephaly, corpus callosum agenesis), and synaptogenesis (→ intellectual disability). There is **no known safe level of alcohol in pregnancy**.

---

### H. Reproductive Complications [2]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Impotence** | Peripheral neuropathy (pelvic autonomic) + direct gonadal toxicity + hypogonadism |
| **Hypogonadism and infertility** | ↓ Testosterone (direct toxic effect on Leydig cells + ↑ aromatisation) → ↓ spermatogenesis |
| **↑ Breast cancer risk** | Alcohol ↑ oestrogen levels; acetaldehyde is a carcinogen; alcohol impairs folate metabolism (folate is needed for DNA repair) |

---

### I. Psychiatric Complications [1][2]

***Psychiatric comorbidity in alcoholism is very common — lifetime diagnosis occurs in 55% of alcoholics*** [2]

#### 1. Alcohol-Induced Mood Disorder [1]

- ***Moderate or heavy alcohol use*** [1]
- ***Major depression or mania*** [1]
- ***Persist for up to 4 weeks after abstinence*** [1]
- ***Clears up on stopping alcohol*** [1]
- 4× risk of major depression in patients with history of alcohol dependence [2]

#### 2. Alcohol-Induced Anxiety Disorder [1]

- ***Symptoms occur while patient on heavy alcohol consumption*** [1]
- ***Symptoms subside gradually on abstinence, but may persist up to 6 months*** [1]
- ***Generalised anxiety disorders / Panic disorder / Phobic anxiety disorders / Social phobia / Obsessive compulsive disorder / PTSD*** [1]
- ***Must be distinguished from alcohol withdrawal syndrome*** [1]

#### 3. Alcoholic Hallucinosis [1]

- ***Chronic heavy drinkers*** [1]
- ***Auditory hallucinations*** [1]
- ***In clear consciousness*** [1]
- ***Distressing in content*** [1]
- ***Some develop schizophrenia, some remit after stopping alcohol use*** [1]
- ***Treatment with antipsychotics and advice to abstain from alcohol*** [1]
- ***Differentiate from delirium tremens: reduction in alcohol intake, clouded sensorium, visual hallucinations*** [1]

#### 4. Alcohol-Induced Schizophrenia-like Psychosis [1]

- ***Chronic heavy drinking*** [1]
- ***Clear sensorium*** [1]
- ***Schizophrenia-like syndrome*** [1]
- ***Remission on stopping alcohol*** [1]
- ***Recur with relapse of alcoholism*** [1]

#### 5. Morbid Jealousy (Othello Syndrome) [2]

- Delusional disorder with theme of partner's infidelity [2]
- Most commonly in men [2]
- Risk of violence: 56% of men and 43% of women [2]
- Mx: antipsychotics [2]

#### 6. Alcohol-Dependent Sleep Disorders [2]

| Sleep pattern in alcohol-dependent patient | Sleep changes in abstinent alcoholics |
|---|---|
| ↓ Sleep latency [2] | ↑ Sleep latency [2] |
| Rebound insomnia [2] | Light and fragmented sleep [2] |
| Repeated awakening [2] | ↓ Overall sleep time with ↓ amount of deep sleep [2] |
| Tolerance with ↓ hypnotic effects by alcohol [2] | ***These changes persist for 2 years after abstinence*** [2] |

Why does alcohol disrupt sleep? Acutely, alcohol promotes sleep onset (GABA potentiation → sedation → ↓ sleep latency), but it suppresses REM sleep and disrupts sleep architecture in the second half of the night (as BAC falls, a "mini-withdrawal" hyperexcitability occurs → awakenings, vivid dreams). Chronically, tolerance develops to the sedative effect, but the sleep-disrupting effects persist. After abstinence, the upregulated excitatory systems take a very long time to re-equilibrate — hence the 2-year persistence.

#### 7. Alcohol and Suicide [1]

***Alcohol and suicide*** [1]:
- ***7% of alcohol abusers die of suicide*** [1]
- ***Alcoholism is a factor in 30% of all completed suicides*** [1]
- ***50% of suicide attempts have consumed alcohol at the time of the attempt*** [1]
- ***96% of alcoholics who die by suicide continue alcohol use up to the end of their lives*** [1]

Why is alcohol so strongly linked to suicide? Multiple convergent mechanisms:
1. **Acute disinhibition** — alcohol removes inhibitory control over impulsive suicidal acts (prefrontal cortex depression)
2. **Chronic depression** — alcohol-induced mood disorder; hopelessness
3. **Social isolation** — progressive loss of relationships, employment, purpose
4. **Comorbid psychiatric disorders** — depression (40%), anxiety (32%), personality disorders
5. **Means availability** — intoxicated individuals are more likely to act on suicidal thoughts with available means
6. **Cognitive constriction** — alcohol narrows attentional focus to immediate distress, reducing ability to see alternative solutions

<Callout title="Alcohol and Suicide — Must Know Statistics" type="error">
These lecture statistics are extremely high-yield for exams: 7% of alcohol abusers die by suicide; 30% of completed suicides involve alcoholism; 50% of suicide attempters had consumed alcohol at the time. Always assess suicide risk in every patient with alcohol misuse.

### J. Psychosocial Complications [2]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Poor functioning** | Cognitive impairment, withdrawal symptoms, preoccupation with drinking |
| **Financial issues** | Money spent on alcohol; job loss from impaired performance |
| **Interpersonal problems** | Disinhibited behaviour, domestic violence, relationship breakdown |
| **Road traffic accidents** | Impaired judgement, coordination, reaction time |
| **Legal problems** | Drink-driving, assault, public order offences |

---

### K. Comorbid Psychiatric Disorders — Impact on Prognosis [1]

***Comorbid psychiatric disorders in alcoholism*** [1]:
- ***Antisocial personality disorders: 80%*** [1]
- ***Bipolar I disorder: 60%*** [1]
- ***Schizophrenia: 30%*** [1]
- ***Drug addiction: 20%*** [1]
- ***Anxiety disorders — social phobia, panic disorder*** [1]

When ***schizophrenia is comorbid*** [1]:
- ***Alcohol decreases feeling of isolation*** [1]
- ***Temporarily reduces symptoms of anxiety / depression / insomnia*** [1]
- ***BUT: increases psychotic symptoms and mood swings*** [1]
- ***Disruptive behaviour, suicide, treatment non-compliance, drug abuse, poor clinical outcome*** [1]
- ***Drug accumulation due to hepatic damage*** [1]

<Callout title="Why Hepatic Damage Matters for Psychiatric Medications">
Chronic alcoholic liver disease impairs hepatic metabolism of psychiatric medications (most antipsychotics and antidepressants undergo hepatic phase I oxidation via CYP enzymes). Reduced hepatic clearance → drug accumulation → toxicity at standard doses. This is why doses of psychotropics often need to be reduced in alcoholic patients with liver disease, and why drug levels and LFTs must be monitored closely.
</Callout>
