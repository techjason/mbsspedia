## Differential Diagnosis of Alcohol Misuse and Alcohol-related Disorders

The differential diagnosis in alcohol-related disorders is not a single, neat list — it varies depending on **which clinical presentation** brings the patient to attention. A patient with alcohol problems can present with intoxication, withdrawal, confusion, psychosis, mood disturbance, anxiety, or cognitive decline. For each presentation, the differential is different. Let's walk through this systematically.

### Organising Framework: What Is the Presenting Problem?

The key clinical question is: **"What am I actually seeing — and what else could cause this?"**

### A. Differential Diagnosis of Acute Confusion in an Alcoholic Patient

This is arguably the most high-yield differential in alcohol psychiatry. ***The lecture explicitly identifies "6 causes of confusion in alcoholism"*** [1]:

| # | ***Cause*** | Key Distinguishing Features | Why This Happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ***Intoxication*** [1] | History of recent alcohol intake; slurred speech, ataxia, nystagmus; BAC elevated; resolves as alcohol is metabolised | GABA-A potentiation + NMDA blockade → generalised CNS depression |
| 2 | ***Delirium Tremens (DT)*** [1] | Onset 48–72h after last drink; fluctuating consciousness, vivid visual hallucinations, tremor, autonomic storm (fever, tachycardia, sweating, hypertension) | Abrupt loss of chronic GABA-A potentiation + unmasked NMDA hyperexcitability → excitotoxic state |
| 3 | ***Head injury / Subdural haematoma*** [1] | History of falls (common in alcoholics); focal neurological signs; may have lucid interval then deterioration; coagulopathy + thrombocytopenia increases bleeding risk | Alcoholics fall frequently + have impaired clotting factors (hepatic dysfunction) + thrombocytopenia → bridging vein tears → subdural collection |
| 4 | ***Metabolic disturbances (e.g. hypoglycaemia)*** [1] | Confusion, aggression, sweating, tremor, seizures; **H'stix confirms low glucose**; responds to IV dextrose | Alcohol metabolism consumes NAD⁺ → insufficient NAD⁺ for gluconeogenesis → hypoglycaemia. Often mimics intoxication exactly |
| 5 | ***Hepatic encephalopathy*** [1] | Asterixis (liver flap), fetor hepaticus, jaundice, stigmata of chronic liver disease; ↑ ammonia; often triggered by GI bleed, infection, constipation | Cirrhosis → failed hepatic clearance of ammonia → crosses BBB → astrocyte swelling (via glutamine accumulation) → cerebral oedema and altered neurotransmission |
| 6 | ***Wernicke encephalopathy*** [1] | Classic triad: confusion + ophthalmoplegia + ataxia (but only ~10% have full triad); responds to IV thiamine | Thiamine deficiency → impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase → energy failure in metabolically active periventricular structures |

<Callout title="The 6 Causes — Must Know for Exams" type="error">
When you see a confused alcoholic patient, you MUST systematically consider all 6 causes. The commonest exam mistake is assuming the patient is "just drunk." Every confused alcoholic needs: H'stix (hypoglycaemia), thiamine (Wernicke), assessment for head injury (subdural), liver assessment (hepatic encephalopathy), and timeline from last drink (withdrawal/DT). Multiple causes can coexist — e.g. a patient can be both hypoglycaemic AND in withdrawal AND have a subdural.
</Callout>

**Additional differentials for confusion in alcoholics** (beyond the classic 6):

| Cause | Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|
| **CNS infection** (meningitis/encephalitis) | Fever, neck stiffness, photophobia; immunocompromised state in alcoholics increases risk; LP needed |
| **Drug overdose / polypharmacy** | Urine toxicology screen; check for co-ingestion of benzodiazepines, opioids, paracetamol |
| **Electrolyte disturbance** (beyond hypoglycaemia) | HypoNa, hypoK, hypoMg, hypoPO₄ — all common in alcoholics due to poor intake, vomiting, and renal losses |
| **Central pontine myelinolysis** | Quadriparesis, dysarthria, dysphagia; history of rapid Na⁺ correction |
| **Alcoholic ketoacidosis** | Anion gap metabolic acidosis; occurs after binge followed by fasting; ketones elevated but glucose may be normal or low |
| **Postictal state** | History of witnessed seizure; gradual resolution; may occur after withdrawal seizure |

### B. Differential Diagnosis of Psychotic Symptoms in an Alcoholic Patient

When an alcoholic patient presents with hallucinations or delusions, you must distinguish between several entities [1][2]:

| Diagnosis | Key Features | How to Differentiate |
|---|---|---|
| ***Alcoholic hallucinosis*** [1] | ***Chronic heavy drinkers; auditory hallucinations; in clear consciousness; distressing in content; some develop schizophrenia, some remit after stopping alcohol use*** [1] | ***Differentiate from delirium tremens: reduction in alcohol intake, clouded sensorium, visual hallucinations*** in DT [1]. Alcoholic hallucinosis has **clear sensorium** and **predominantly auditory** hallucinations |
| **Delirium tremens** | Visual hallucinations (classically Lilliputian — small animals/insects), clouded/fluctuating consciousness, autonomic storm, tremor | Onset 48–72h after cessation; **clouded sensorium** is the key distinguisher from hallucinosis |
| **Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (delusional)** | Typically **morbid jealousy** (Othello syndrome) — abnormal belief partner is unfaithful; incessant cross-questioning, searching for evidence; risk of violence [2] | Content is specifically jealousy-themed; often in male chronic drinkers; other causes include schizophrenia, mood disorder, organic disorder, paranoid personality disorder [2] |
| **Primary schizophrenia** | Schneiderian first-rank symptoms; persistent psychosis independent of alcohol use; deteriorating function over time; FHx of psychosis | Psychotic symptoms persist > 4 weeks after abstinence; onset may predate alcohol use; negative symptoms prominent |
| **Substance-induced psychosis (other substances)** | Stimulants (methamphetamine, cocaine) and cannabis are common causes; urine drug screen positive | Temporal relationship with substance use; resolves with clearance of substance |
| **Mood disorder with psychotic features** | Psychosis is mood-congruent (e.g. nihilistic delusions in depression, grandiose delusions in mania); affective symptoms predominate | Psychotic features occur within the context of a mood episode |

***Diagnosing a comorbid primary psychiatric disorder in an alcoholic*** is supported by [1]:
- ***Evidence of psychiatric disorder before onset of alcohol abuse or dependence*** [1]
- ***Evidence of persistent psychiatric symptoms during extended alcohol-free periods (over 4 weeks)*** [1]
- ***First-degree biological relative has documented psychiatric disorder*** [1]

---

### C. Differential Diagnosis of Mood Disturbance in an Alcoholic Patient

***Alcohol-induced mood disorder*** [1]:
- ***Moderate or heavy alcohol use*** [1]
- ***Major depression or mania*** [1]
- ***Persists for up to 4 weeks after abstinence*** [1]
- ***Clears up on stopping alcohol*** [1]

The differential here asks: **is the mood disorder primary (independent) or secondary (alcohol-induced)?**

| Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|
| ***Alcohol-induced depressive disorder*** | Temporal relationship with heavy alcohol use; symptoms clear within 4 weeks of abstinence [1]; no history of depression before alcohol misuse |
| **Primary major depressive disorder with comorbid alcoholism** | Depression predates alcohol use; persists > 4 weeks after sustained abstinence; FHx of mood disorder; ***response to treatment is much less likely if comorbid alcoholism is NOT dealt with*** [2] |
| ***Alcohol-induced mania*** [1] | Manic symptoms in context of heavy alcohol use; resolves with abstinence |
| ***Bipolar I disorder with comorbid alcoholism*** | ***60% of bipolar I patients have alcoholism*** [1]; manic/hypomanic episodes predate alcohol use or persist in abstinence; ↑ impulsivity during mania drives drinking |
| **Hypothyroidism** | Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation; check TFT — alcoholics may have thyroid dysfunction |
| **Adjustment disorder** | Depressive symptoms temporally related to a psychosocial stressor; does not meet full criteria for MDD; develops within 3 months of stressor [2] |
| **Organic causes of depression** | Cushing syndrome, malignancy, cerebral pathology — clinical assessment and investigations guided by suspicion |

<Callout title="The 4-Week Rule">
If mood or anxiety symptoms persist for > 4 weeks after complete alcohol abstinence, the psychiatric disorder is more likely to be primary (independent) rather than alcohol-induced. This is a critical clinical and exam distinction. Alcohol-induced mood disorder should clear within 4 weeks; alcohol-induced anxiety may take up to 6 months.
</Callout>

### D. Differential Diagnosis of Anxiety Symptoms in an Alcoholic Patient

***Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder*** [1]:
- ***Symptoms occur while patient is on heavy alcohol consumption*** [1]
- ***Symptoms subside gradually on abstinence, but may persist up to 6 months*** [1]
- ***Generalised anxiety disorders / Panic disorder / Phobic anxiety disorders / Social phobia / Obsessive compulsive disorder / PTSD*** can all be mimicked [1]
- ***Must be distinguished from alcohol withdrawal syndrome*** [1]

| Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|
| **Alcohol withdrawal** | Onset within 6–48h of last drink; autonomic hyperactivity (tremor, sweating, tachycardia); time-limited; responds to BZDs | 
| ***Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder*** | Occurs **during** heavy consumption (not just on withdrawal); subside gradually with abstinence but may persist up to 6 months [1] |
| **Primary anxiety disorder with self-medication** | Anxiety predates alcohol use; persists in extended abstinence (> 6 months); FHx of anxiety; ***alcohol use may serve as self-medication in pre-existent anxiety disorders*** [2] |
| **Medical causes of anxiety** | Thyrotoxicosis, phaeochromocytoma (episodic), hypoglycaemia (episodic), PE, COPD, cardiac arrhythmia [2] |
| **Medication/substance-induced anxiety** | Stimulants (caffeine, amphetamines, cocaine); withdrawal from other sedatives (BZDs, opioids); medications (corticosteroids, sympathomimetics, anticholinergics) [2] |

---

### E. Differential Diagnosis of Cognitive Decline / Memory Impairment in an Alcoholic Patient

| Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|
| **Korsakoff syndrome** | Profound anterograde amnesia + confabulation; follows untreated Wernicke encephalopathy; mamillary body/medial thalamic damage; other cognitive functions relatively preserved |
| **Alcoholic dementia** | Frontal-predominant cognitive decline (executive dysfunction, personality change); multifactorial aetiology; diagnosed ≥ 8 weeks after abstinence [2]; cortical atrophy with enlarged ventricles on imaging |
| **Alzheimer disease** | Insidious onset; progressive; hippocampal atrophy on MRI; amyloid/tau biomarkers; no clear relationship to alcohol intake |
| **Vascular dementia** | Stepwise deterioration; vascular risk factors; white matter changes on MRI |
| **Hepatic encephalopathy** | Fluctuating; asterixis; ↑ ammonia; improves with lactulose/rifaximin |
| **B12/folate deficiency** | Megaloblastic anaemia (but can have neurological features without anaemia); subacute combined degeneration of cord; common in alcoholics due to malabsorption |
| **Normal-pressure hydrocephalus** | Classic triad: gait apraxia, urinary incontinence, dementia; ventriculomegaly out of proportion to sulcal widening |
| **Chronic subdural haematoma** | Fluctuating consciousness, headache, focal signs; common in alcoholics (falls + coagulopathy) |

---

### F. Differential Diagnosis of Seizures in an Alcoholic Patient

| Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|
| **Alcohol withdrawal seizures** | Generalised tonic-clonic; onset 12–48h after last drink; often a single seizure or brief cluster; risk of kindling with repeated withdrawals |
| **Primary epilepsy** | History of seizures unrelated to alcohol use; abnormal EEG; may require long-term AEDs |
| **Hypoglycaemia-induced seizures** | Low H'stix; responds to glucose |
| **Hyponatraemia** | Serum Na⁺ < 120 mmol/L; check electrolytes urgently |
| **Structural lesion** | Subdural haematoma, brain tumour, AVM; focal features on examination; CT/MRI needed |
| **Meningitis/encephalitis** | Fever, neck stiffness; LP findings |
| **Hepatic encephalopathy** | Advanced liver disease; ↑ ammonia |

### G. The Bidirectional Relationship — A Diagnostic Challenge

***The relationship between alcoholism and psychiatric symptoms is bidirectional, with confounding factors*** [1]:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Alcoholism"] -->|"alcohol-induced disorder"| B["Psychiatric Symptoms"]
    B -->|"self-medication"| A
    C["Confounding Factors"] --> A
    C --> B
    
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

This means that when you encounter a patient with both alcohol misuse and psychiatric symptoms, you must consider three possibilities [1]:

1. **Alcohol → Psychiatric disorder** (alcohol-induced): alcohol directly causes the psychiatric symptoms through neurotoxicity, neurotransmitter disruption, or nutritional deficiency
2. **Psychiatric disorder → Alcohol** (self-medication): the patient drinks to cope with pre-existing psychiatric symptoms (e.g. social phobia → drinking to cope with social situations)
3. **Confounding factors**: both the alcohol misuse and the psychiatric disorder are independently caused by shared risk factors (e.g. childhood trauma, genetics, social deprivation) [1]

***The key clinical approach to untangling this*** [1]:
- ***Evidence of psychiatric disorder BEFORE onset of alcohol abuse or dependence*** [1]
- ***Persistent psychiatric symptoms during extended alcohol-free periods (over 4 weeks)*** [1]
- ***First-degree biological relative has documented psychiatric disorder*** [1]

If these criteria are met, the psychiatric disorder is more likely **primary** (comorbid) rather than alcohol-induced.

### I. Summary: Key Differentials by Comorbidity Prevalence [1][2]

***Psychiatric comorbidity is very common in alcoholism (lifetime diagnosis occurs in 55% of alcoholics)*** [2]:

| ***Comorbid Condition*** | ***Prevalence*** | ***Key Differentiating Point*** |
|---|---|---|
| ***Mood disorders*** | ***40% of alcoholics*** [2] | Depression is the most common comorbidity; 4× risk of MDD |
| ***Antisocial personality disorder*** | ***80% of ASPD patients have alcoholism*** [1] | Longstanding pattern of disregard for others' rights; onset before age 15 |
| ***Bipolar I disorder*** | ***60% of bipolar I patients*** [1] | Manic episodes predate alcohol use; impulsivity drives drinking |
| ***Schizophrenia*** | ***30% abuse alcohol*** [1] | ***Alcohol decreases feeling of isolation; temporarily reduces anxiety/depression/insomnia; but increases psychotic symptoms and mood swings*** [1] |
| ***Drug addiction*** | ***20% of drug abusers are alcoholic; alcoholics are 6× more prone to become drug abusers*** [1] | Urine drug screen; polysubstance use history |
| ***Anxiety disorders*** | Social phobia, panic disorder common [1] | May be self-medication; must distinguish from withdrawal |
