## Definition and Terminology

Alcohol misuse refers to a spectrum of maladaptive patterns of alcohol consumption that cause clinically significant impairment or distress. The terminology has evolved over time:

- **Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)** — the current DSM-5 unified term (replacing the older DSM-IV dichotomy of "alcohol abuse" vs "alcohol dependence") [1]
- **Harmful use** — ICD-10 term for a pattern of drinking causing damage to physical or mental health
- **Dependence syndrome** — ICD-10/ICD-11 term describing a cluster of physiological, behavioural, and cognitive phenomena (tolerance, withdrawal, compulsion, loss of control, continued use despite harm, neglect of other activities)
- ***Alcoholism*** — a colloquial, non-diagnostic term still widely used clinically

Breaking down the key term: "alcohol" derives from Arabic *al-kuḥl* (originally meaning a fine powder, later applied to distilled spirits); "misuse" implies a pattern beyond social/recreational use that leads to harm.

<Callout title="Spectrum of Alcohol Use">
Think of alcohol problems as a continuum: social drinking → hazardous drinking (at-risk but no current harm) → harmful drinking (demonstrable damage) → alcohol dependence (physiological and psychological reliance). A patient can sit anywhere on this spectrum, and movement is bidirectional.

## Epidemiology

### Global Perspective

- Alcohol is the **7th leading risk factor** for death and disability globally (GBD 2016 data, confirmed in 2019 updates)
- Contributes to > 3 million deaths/year (5.3% of all deaths worldwide) — WHO Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health
- Responsible for > 200 disease and injury conditions
- Heavy episodic drinking (binge drinking) prevalence ~18.2% globally among drinkers

### Hong Kong Specific Epidemiology [2]

> These HK-specific figures are frequently tested.

- ***23.7% drank alcohol occasionally, 9.4% at least once/week, 61.6% non-drinkers*** [2]
- ***66.5% usually drink beer, 19.6% table wine, 10.6% Chinese rice wine, 6.9% spirits*** [2]
- ***Among drinkers, M:F ≈ 2:1; 7.2% were binge drinkers*** [2]
- ***16.9% reported drinking beyond daily limit. 5.8% exhibited signs of drunkenness*** [2]
- ***Alcohol-related deaths contributed to 0.14% of deaths (58 in 2009)*** [2]

### Age and Sex Distribution

- Males consistently have higher rates of AUD (2–3× females) — this gap is narrowing in younger cohorts
- Peak onset of AUD: late teens to mid-20s
- Women develop alcohol-related organ damage (liver, brain, cardiomyopathy) at **lower cumulative doses** and **shorter durations** than men — the so-called "telescoping effect"

Why are women more susceptible? Two key reasons [2]:
1. **Lower total body water** (proportionally more adipose tissue) → higher blood alcohol concentration (BAC) for the same dose per kg
2. **Lower gastric alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity** → less first-pass metabolism → more ethanol reaches systemic circulation

## Risk Factors

### Biological Factors

#### Genetics [2][3]

- ***Genetic predisposition plays a substantial role (heritability ≈ 50%)*** [2]
- ***Family/twin studies: MZ > DZ concordance rate, ↑ in adopted descendants of alcoholics*** [2]
- ***Cloninger subtypes:*** [2]
  - ***Cloninger Type 1:*** later age of onset, only mildly genetic, occurs in both M + F, associated with anxious/harm-avoidant personality
  - ***Cloninger Type 2:*** earlier age of onset, strongly genetic, occurs predominantly in M, associated with criminality and sociopathic disorder, novelty-seeking personality
- ***Key genes include:*** [2]
  - ***Alcohol metabolism enzymes: ALDH2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase) inactivating mutation — much more common in Asians and associated with ↓ risk of alcohol dependence*** [2] — this is the so-called "Asian flush" variant (ALDH2*2), which causes accumulation of acetaldehyde → flushing, nausea, tachycardia after drinking → acts as a protective factor
  - ***Neurotransmitter-related: GABRG1, GABRA2 (GABA_A receptor genes), COMT, DRD2 (dopamine D₂ receptor)*** [2]

<Callout title="ALDH2*2 — Hong Kong High Yield" type="idea">
About 30–40% of East Asians carry the ALDH2*2 allele. Homozygotes (ALDH2*2/*2) almost never become alcoholics because the aversive acetaldehyde reaction is so severe. Heterozygotes have intermediate risk. This is why disulfiram works — it pharmacologically mimics what ALDH2*2 does genetically. However, note that ALDH2*2 carriers who DO drink are at higher risk of oesophageal and head/neck cancers (acetaldehyde is a carcinogen).
</Callout>

#### Neurobiological [2]

- ***Some biological abnormalities found to predate and predict later alcohol misuse:*** [2]
  - ***↓ Cognitive performance in some aspects, e.g. executive function, abnormal P300 visual evoked potential (VEP)*** [2]
  - ***↓ Sensitivity to acute intoxication effects of alcohol*** [2] — paradoxically, individuals who need more alcohol to "feel drunk" are at higher risk because they consume more before experiencing negative feedback

### Psychological Factors [2]

#### Personality Factors
- ***Associated personalities include:*** [2]
  - ***Chronic anxiety, pervading sense of inferiority, self-indulgent tendencies***
  - ***Traits related to risk-taking and novelty-seeking, antisocial personality disorder***

#### Learning Theories [2]
- ***Behaviour modelling:*** postulated that children of alcoholics model their behaviour on parents, but the risk seems little influenced by whether parents are currently drinking or not [2]
- ***Reward dependence:*** alcohol use leads to ↑ pleasurable feelings and ↓ anxiety → behavioural reinforcement, especially in those who ignore negative consequences (positive and negative reinforcement via the mesolimbic dopamine pathway) [2]

### Social Factors [2]

#### Childhood Factors
- ***Childhood exposure to potentially traumatic events, especially emotional abuse*** [2]
- ***Other environmental factors: family disruption, poverty, social isolation*** [2]

#### Psychiatric Comorbidity as a Risk Factor
- ***Alcohol use can be a cause or effect of other psychiatric disorders*** [2]
  - Chronic alcohol use can **precede** development of major psychiatric disorders (e.g. mood disorders, psychotic disorders)
  - Alcohol use can be a **maladaptive response** (self-medication) to ↓ distress from other psychiatric disorders

#### Societal/Cultural Factors
- Availability and affordability of alcohol (HK: relatively cheap, 24-hour availability in convenience stores)
- Cultural norms (drinking at business dinners, social gatherings)
- Peer pressure, social circle influence
- Occupation — high-risk occupations include hospitality, military, medical profession (access + stress)

## Anatomy, Physiology, and Pharmacology of Alcohol

### Alcohol Metabolism

Understanding metabolism is critical because it underpins intoxication, withdrawal, organ damage, and drug interactions.

**Step 1: Ethanol → Acetaldehyde**
- Enzyme: **Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)** — primarily in gastric mucosa and hepatocytes
- Cofactor: NAD⁺ → reduced to NADH
- Also via **Microsomal Ethanol Oxidizing System (MEOS/CYP2E1)** — inducible with chronic use (explains metabolic tolerance)
- Also via **catalase** (minor pathway, in peroxisomes)

**Step 2: Acetaldehyde → Acetate**
- Enzyme: **Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)** — primarily mitochondrial ALDH2
- Cofactor: NAD⁺ → NADH
- Acetaldehyde is **toxic** and **carcinogenic** — responsible for the "flush reaction," hangover symptoms, and long-term tissue damage

**Step 3: Acetate → CO₂ + H₂O**
- Acetate enters peripheral tissues, converted to acetyl-CoA → enters TCA cycle

> **Key metabolic consequence:** Chronic ethanol metabolism massively shifts the hepatic NAD⁺/NADH ratio toward NADH. This has widespread metabolic consequences:
> - ↓ Gluconeogenesis → ***alcoholic hypoglycaemia*** (occurs 6–36h after ingestion of > 30g alcohol) [2]
> - ↓ Fatty acid oxidation → fatty liver (steatosis)
> - ↑ Lactate (pyruvate → lactate is favoured) → lactic acidosis
> - ↑ Uric acid (lactate competes with urate for renal excretion) → gout

### Neuropharmacology of Alcohol [2][3]

Alcohol is fundamentally a **CNS depressant** that acts on multiple neurotransmitter systems:

| System | Acute Effect of Alcohol | Chronic Adaptation | Relevance to Withdrawal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GABA-A** | ***↑ GABA-ergic (inhibitory) neurotransmission*** — potentiates GABA at GABA-A receptors [2] | Downregulation of GABA-A receptors (tolerance) | ***↓ GABA-related inhibitory tone*** → hyperexcitability [2] |
| **NMDA (glutamate)** | ***Inhibition of glutamatergic (excitatory) neurotransmission*** via NMDA receptor blockade [2] | ***Upregulation of NMDA receptors*** [2] | ***Unregulated excess NMDA-related excitatory transmission*** [2] → seizures, autonomic storm |
| **Dopamine** | ***↑ DA release*** in mesolimbic pathway (nucleus accumbens) → ***pleasurable effect*** [2] | Downregulation of DA receptors | Dysphoria, anhedonia, craving |
| **Serotonin** | ***Indirectly alters release of serotonin*** [2] | Serotonergic dysfunction | Mood disturbance, anxiety |
| **Opioid** | ↑ Endogenous opioid (endorphin) release | Opioid system dysregulation | Dysphoria |
| **Norepinephrine** | ***Indirectly alters release of NE*** [2] | Upregulation of adrenergic system | Autonomic hyperactivity (tremor, sweating, tachycardia, hypertension) |

<Callout title="The GABA-Glutamate Seesaw — Core Concept" type="idea">
Think of the brain as a seesaw between inhibition (GABA) and excitation (glutamate/NMDA). Alcohol acutely pushes the seesaw toward inhibition. With chronic use, the brain compensates by reducing GABA sensitivity and increasing NMDA receptors (trying to restore balance). When alcohol is suddenly removed, the seesaw swings violently toward excitation — this is why withdrawal causes tremors, seizures, and delirium tremens. This is the single most important concept in alcohol withdrawal pathophysiology.
</Callout>

### Quantifying Alcohol Use [2]

- ***In HK, 1 unit of alcohol = 10g pure ethanol*** [2]
- ***Number of standard drinks = drink volume (L) × alcohol content (%vol) × 0.789*** [2]
  - The 0.789 factor accounts for the density of ethanol (0.789 g/mL)
- ***Safe drinking limit = 2 units/day (M) vs 1 unit/day (F)*** [2]

Practical unit estimates [2]:
| Drink | Approximate Units |
|---|---|
| 1 can of beer (330 mL, 5%) | 1.3 units |
| 1 glass of wine (125 mL, 12%) | 1.2 units |
| 1 shot of spirits (22 mL, 40%) | 0.7 units |
| 1 small glass of rice wine (20 mL, 30%) | 0.6 units |

**Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC):**
- ***0.1 mg/L on breathalyser corresponds to 21 mg/dL in blood*** [2]
- ***BAC of 5 mg/dL (22 µg/100 mL on breathalyser) is the driving limit in HK*** [2]

---

## Etiology and Pathophysiology (Integrated)

The aetiology of alcohol misuse is **biopsychosocial** — it arises from an interaction of biological vulnerability, psychological factors, and social environment [2]. No single factor is sufficient or necessary; it is the convergence of multiple factors that determines risk.

### Neurobiological Basis of Addiction

The core mechanism of alcohol addiction involves the **mesolimbic dopamine (reward) pathway**:

1. **Ventral tegmental area (VTA)** → projects dopaminergic neurons to the **nucleus accumbens (NAc)**
2. Alcohol (and other substances) increase dopamine release in the NAc → subjective pleasure/reward
3. With repeated exposure, neuroadaptation occurs:
   - **Tolerance** — need more alcohol for the same reward (GABA-A downregulation, NMDA upregulation, CYP2E1 induction)
   - **Sensitisation** of incentive-salience pathways — environmental cues associated with alcohol become powerfully motivating
   - **Negative reinforcement** — drinking to avoid withdrawal becomes a dominant driver
4. Prefrontal cortex (executive control) is progressively impaired → loss of inhibitory control over drinking behaviour

***Alcoholism affects the brain front (frontal dementia), back (cerebellar vermis) and centre (corpus callosum)*** [2] — this elegant summary reminds us that chronic alcohol causes:
- **Frontal** lobe atrophy → executive dysfunction, disinhibition, personality change
- **Cerebellar vermis** degeneration → gait ataxia (heel-shin test abnormal > finger-nose test)
- **Corpus callosum** degeneration (Marchiafava-Bignami disease) → disconnection syndrome

---

## Classification

### ICD-11 Classification of Alcohol-related Disorders

1. **Episode of harmful use of alcohol** — single episode causing damage
2. **Harmful pattern of use of alcohol** — repeated pattern causing damage
3. **Alcohol dependence** — chronic relapsing condition with compulsion, tolerance, withdrawal
4. **Alcohol intoxication** — acute reversible syndrome
5. **Alcohol withdrawal** — physiological syndrome upon cessation/reduction
6. **Alcohol-induced disorders** — e.g. alcohol-induced mood disorder, psychotic disorder, neurocognitive disorder

### DSM-5 Classification

- **Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)** — mild (2–3 criteria), moderate (4–5 criteria), severe (6+ criteria out of 11)
- Alcohol intoxication
- Alcohol withdrawal
- Alcohol-induced mental disorders (specify type: depressive, anxiety, psychotic, sleep, sexual dysfunction, neurocognitive)

### Cloninger Classification [2]

| Feature | ***Type 1*** | ***Type 2*** |
|---|---|---|
| ***Age of onset*** | ***Later*** | ***Earlier (before 25)*** |
| ***Genetic influence*** | ***Mildly genetic*** | ***Strongly genetic*** |
| ***Sex*** | ***Both M + F*** | ***Predominantly M*** |
| ***Personality*** | Harm-avoidant, anxious | ***Novelty-seeking, a/w criminality and sociopathic disorder*** |
| Alcohol-seeking behaviour | Loss of control | Inability to abstain |
| Environmental influence | Strong | Weak |

## Clinical Features

The clinical features of alcohol misuse can be organised into:
- A. Acute intoxication
- B. Chronic use features (symptoms and signs of dependence)
- C. Withdrawal syndrome
- D. Long-term medical sequelae
- E. Long-term psychiatric sequelae

### A. Acute Alcohol Intoxication

Clinical features are dose-dependent and relate to BAC:

| BAC (mg/dL) | Clinical Features | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| 20–50 | Relaxation, mild euphoria, ↓ inhibitions | Potentiation of GABA-A in limbic system → ↓ cortical inhibition of reward pathways |
| 50–100 | Impaired coordination, ↓ reaction time, emotional lability | GABA-A potentiation + NMDA inhibition in cerebellum and motor cortex |
| 100–200 | Slurred speech, ataxia, diplopia, nausea/vomiting | Progressive cerebellar and brainstem depression |
| 200–300 | Marked ataxia, hypothermia, severe dysarthria | Brainstem depression, impaired thermoregulation |
| 300–400 | Stupor, coma | Severe generalised CNS depression |
| > 400 | Respiratory depression, death | Medullary respiratory centre depression |

> Note: Tolerant individuals may show surprisingly few signs at BAC levels that would incapacitate a naive drinker. ***No intoxication despite ↑↑BAC can denote development of tolerance*** [2].

#### Other Intoxication-Related Phenomena [2]

**Alcoholic blackouts** [2]:
- ***S/S: a transient amnesia lasting hours, but usually without impairment of conscious level*** [2]
- ***Reason: inhibition of NMDA receptors in hippocampus → failure of long-term potentiation (LTP)*** [2]
- The hippocampus requires NMDA receptor activation to consolidate short-term into long-term memories; alcohol blocks this

***Alcoholic hypoglycaemia*** [2]:
- ***Occurs 6–36h after ingestion of > 30g of alcohol (moderate amount)*** [2]
- ***MoA: alcohol metabolism into acetaldehyde consumes NAD⁺ → ↑↑↑ NADH:NAD⁺ ratio in liver → insufficient NAD⁺ supply for gluconeogenesis → hypoglycaemia*** [2]
- ***S/S: confusion, aggression, stupor, coma, hypothermia → often mistaken as alcohol intoxication*** [2]
- ***Dx: hypoglycaemia is an important d/dx in confused patient with prior alcohol intake → should take H'stix before assuming intoxication*** [2]
- ***Mx: IV 50% dextrose after thiamine*** [2]

#### Management of Acute Intoxication [2]
- ***Primarily supportive*** [2]
- ***IV fluid hydration to correct volume depletion and hypotension*** [2]
- ***D50 infusion if hypoglycaemia is present*** [2]
- ***100 mg parenteral thiamine mandatory if present with coma (for prevention of B₁ deficiency)*** [2]
- ***'Thiamine before dextrose': traditional teaching that thiamine should be given before dextrose*** [2]
  - ***Basis: theoretically, glucose loading in a thiamine-deficient cell may result in lactic acidosis as the TCA cycle fails to work in thiamine-deficient environment*** [2]
  - ***Evidence: weak, likely NOT evidence-based → thiamine can be given together with dextrose*** [2]
- ***Benzodiazepines or first-generation antipsychotics (FGA) can be used if agitated*** [2]

<Callout title="Common Exam Mistake" type="error">
Never assume a "drunk" patient is simply intoxicated. Always check blood glucose (H'stix), because alcoholic hypoglycaemia closely mimics intoxication (confusion, aggression, hypothermia). Missing hypoglycaemia can be fatal. Also consider: subdural haematoma, hepatic encephalopathy, Wernicke encephalopathy, and head injury — all common in alcoholics and all mimicking intoxication.
</Callout>

### B. Clinical Features of Dependence

The ICD-10/ICD-11 dependence syndrome requires **3 or more** of the following in the past 12 months. DSM-5 AUD uses a single list of 11 criteria (≥ 2 for diagnosis). The core features and their pathophysiology:

| Feature | Explanation | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|---|
| **Compulsion/craving** | Strong desire or sense of compulsion to drink | Sensitisation of incentive-salience in mesolimbic DA pathway; conditioned cue-reactivity |
| **Difficulty in controlling use** | Onset, termination, or amount of drinking | Prefrontal cortical dysfunction → impaired executive control; habit formation in dorsal striatum |
| **Tolerance** | Need for increasing amounts to achieve same effect | GABA-A receptor downregulation, NMDA receptor upregulation, CYP2E1 induction (metabolic tolerance) |
| **Withdrawal** | Physical symptoms on cessation/reduction | GABA-glutamate imbalance: ↓ GABAergic inhibition + ↑ NMDA excitatory transmission |
| **Neglect of other activities** | Progressive neglect of alternative pleasures or interests | Reward system "hijacked" — natural rewards pale compared to drug-induced DA surges |
| **Persistent use despite harmful consequences** | Continued drinking despite awareness of physical, psychological, or social harm | Compulsive behaviour loop; impaired prefrontal insight and decision-making |
| **Stereotyped pattern** | Narrowing of drinking repertoire | Fixed drinking patterns emerge as the behaviour becomes habitual |

### C. Withdrawal Syndrome [2]

#### Pathophysiology [2]

- ***Impact of chronic use: insensitivity to GABA + upregulation of NMDA receptors*** [2]
- ***Withdrawal: ↓ GABA-related inhibitory tone + unregulated excess NMDA-related excitatory transmission*** [2]
- This produces a state of CNS hyperexcitability — explaining every feature of withdrawal

#### Timeline of Alcohol Withdrawal

***Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal vary with individual (?genetic predisposition)*** [2]:

| Time After Last Drink | Feature | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|---|
| **6–12 hours** | Tremor, anxiety, nausea, insomnia, sweating, tachycardia | Noradrenergic and glutamatergic overactivity; ↓ GABAergic tone |
| **12–24 hours** | Alcoholic hallucinosis (visual/auditory hallucinations with **clear sensorium**) | Cortical hyperexcitability (NMDA upregulation) without global confusion |
| **12–48 hours** | Withdrawal seizures (generalised tonic-clonic) | NMDA hyperexcitability + loss of GABA-mediated seizure threshold; often in patients with "kindling" from repeated withdrawals |
| **48–72 hours** | **Delirium Tremens (DT)** — the most severe form | Full-blown excitotoxic state with autonomic storm |

#### Delirium Tremens (DT) — Detail

- Onset: typically 48–72 hours (but can occur up to 5–7 days) after last drink
- Classic triad: **Confusion** (delirium with fluctuating consciousness), **Tremor** (coarse), **Autonomic hyperactivity** (fever, sweating, tachycardia, hypertension)
- Other features: vivid visual hallucinations (classically small animals/insects — "Lilliputian hallucinations"), paranoid ideation, agitation, insomnia
- **Mortality: 5–15% untreated** (historically up to 35%); < 1–2% with modern ICU care
- Risk factors for DT: previous DT/withdrawal seizures, comorbid illness, older age, heavy prolonged drinking, high BAC at presentation, electrolyte abnormalities
- **Kindling effect**: each successive withdrawal episode tends to be more severe than the last — NMDA receptor upregulation becomes progressively more exaggerated with repeated withdrawal-reinstatement cycles

### D. Long-term Medical Sequelae (Organ-by-Organ)

Chronic alcohol causes damage through multiple mechanisms:
1. **Direct toxicity** (ethanol and acetaldehyde are directly cytotoxic)
2. **Nutritional deficiency** (B1/thiamine, B3/niacin, B6, B12, folate, zinc, magnesium)
3. **Metabolic disruption** (NAD⁺/NADH ratio, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism)
4. **Immune dysregulation** (↓ immune function → infections)

| System | Condition | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Liver** | Steatosis → Steatohepatitis → Fibrosis → Cirrhosis → HCC | Shifted NAD⁺/NADH ratio → ↓ fatty acid oxidation → fat accumulation; acetaldehyde-protein adducts → immune-mediated hepatocyte injury; stellate cell activation → collagen deposition |
| **GI** | Oesophageal varices, Mallory-Weiss tears, gastritis/peptic ulcer, pancreatitis (acute and chronic), oesophageal carcinoma | Portal hypertension (varices); direct mucosal irritation (gastritis); acetaldehyde is a group 1 carcinogen (oesophageal Ca); pancreatic duct protein plugging → calcification |
| **CVS** | Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (dilated), AF, hypertension | Direct myocardial toxicity (acetaldehyde); holiday heart (binge → AF due to autonomic surge and direct electrophysiological effects); chronic sympathetic activation |
| **Haem** | Macrocytosis (↑MCV), folate deficiency megaloblastic anaemia, sideroblastic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia | Folate malabsorption/↓intake → megaloblastic change; direct marrow suppression; ↑MCV also from direct membrane effect of ethanol on erythroblasts |
| **Endocrine** | Pseudo-Cushing syndrome, hypogonadism (gynaecomastia, testicular atrophy), hypoglycaemia | ↑ CRH/cortisol; ↑ aromatisation of androgens → oestrogens in liver + direct gonadal toxicity; ↓ NAD⁺ for gluconeogenesis |
| **MSK** | Myopathy, osteoporosis, gout | Direct myotoxicity; ↓ osteoblast activity + ↑ osteoclast activity; ↑ uric acid (lactate competes for renal tubular excretion) |
| **Neurological** | See below (major section) | Multiple mechanisms — direct toxicity, nutritional deficiency, excitotoxicity |

#### Neurological Complications (High Yield — ***"6 Causes of Confusion in Alcoholism"***) [1]

***The lecture specifically highlights "6 causes of confusion in alcoholism"*** [1] — this is a critical exam framework:

1. **Acute intoxication** — GABA potentiation, NMDA blockade
2. **Alcohol withdrawal / Delirium Tremens** — GABA/NMDA imbalance → excitotoxicity
3. **Wernicke encephalopathy** — thiamine (B1) deficiency → impaired glucose metabolism in vulnerable brain regions (mamillary bodies, medial thalamus, periaqueductal grey, cerebellar vermis)
4. **Hepatic encephalopathy** — ↑ ammonia (failed hepatic metabolism in cirrhosis) → astrocyte swelling, altered neurotransmission
5. **Hypoglycaemia** — ↓ NAD⁺ for gluconeogenesis
6. **Subdural haematoma** — falls + coagulopathy (↓ clotting factors from hepatic dysfunction + thrombocytopenia) → bridging vein tears

**Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome** — the hallmark nutritional neuropsychiatric complication:

- **Wernicke encephalopathy** (acute, reversible if treated early):
  - Classic triad: **Confusion**, **Ophthalmoplegia** (especially CN VI palsy → lateral rectus paralysis → diplopia), **Ataxia** (cerebellar vermis degeneration)
  - Why these areas? Thiamine (as thiamine pyrophosphate, TPP) is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase — areas with high metabolic demand and turnover (periventricular structures) are most vulnerable to energy failure
  - Only **~10% present with the classic triad** — have a low threshold for diagnosis
  - Treatment: **IV thiamine 500 mg TDS for 3 days** (high-dose Pabrinex) — must be given **before or with** glucose

- **Korsakoff syndrome** (chronic, largely irreversible):
  - Develops in ~80% of untreated Wernicke patients
  - **Profound anterograde amnesia** (inability to form new memories) + **retrograde amnesia** (loss of old memories, with temporal gradient)
  - **Confabulation** — production of fabricated memories to fill gaps (not intentional lying; the brain's attempt to make sense of memory gaps)
  - Why? Damage to **mamillary bodies** and **medial thalamic nuclei** — key structures in the Papez circuit of memory
  - Only ~20% recover significantly even with thiamine supplementation

Other key neurological complications:

| Condition | Features | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Cerebellar degeneration** | Gait ataxia (wide-based), heel-shin test abnormal > finger-nose; truncal > limb ataxia | Purkinje cell loss in anterior superior vermis — combination of direct ethanol toxicity and thiamine deficiency |
| **Peripheral neuropathy** | Symmetric distal sensorimotor ("stocking-glove"), painful paraesthesiae, ↓ ankle jerks | Direct neurotoxicity + B-vitamin deficiency (B1, B6, B12) → axonal degeneration (dying-back neuropathy) |
| **Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM)** | Quadriparesis, pseudobulbar palsy, "locked-in" syndrome | Overly rapid correction of hyponatraemia → osmotic stress on oligodendrocytes in basis pontis → demyelination |
| **Marchiafava-Bignami disease** | Disconnection syndrome, seizures, cognitive decline | Demyelination/necrosis of corpus callosum — mechanism unclear, likely direct toxicity + nutritional deficiency |
| ***Alcohol-tobacco amblyopia*** [2] | ***↓ VA with central scotoma and loss of colour vision*** | ***Heavy drinking + smoking → deficiency of thiamine or B12 → optic atrophy*** |
| **Alcoholic dementia** | Progressive cognitive decline, frontal predominance (executive dysfunction, personality change) | Multifactorial: direct neurotoxicity, repeated excitotoxic episodes (withdrawals), nutritional deficiency, vascular risk |

<Callout title="Never Correct Hyponatraemia Too Quickly" type="error">
***Never correct hyponatraemia quicker than ~10 mmol/24h*** [2] in an alcoholic patient. Rapid correction → osmotic demyelination syndrome (central pontine myelinolysis). The pons is particularly susceptible because of its unique vascular architecture and high oligodendrocyte density. This is irreversible and devastating.
</Callout>

### E. Long-term Psychiatric Sequelae [1][2]

***Psychiatric comorbidity in alcoholism is very common (lifetime diagnosis occurs in 55% of alcoholics)*** [2]

***Causation: alcoholism often co-occurs with psychiatric disorders but causation is often unclear*** [2]

***The relationship is bidirectional, with confounding factors*** [1]:
- ***Alcoholism → Psychiatric symptoms*** (alcohol-induced disorders)
- ***Psychiatric symptoms → Alcoholism*** (self-medication)
- ***Confounding factors*** complicate the picture [1]

***Diagnosing comorbid psychiatric disorder in alcoholics is supported by*** [1][2]:
- ***Evidence of psychiatric disorder before onset of alcohol abuse or dependence*** [1]
- ***Evidence of persistent psychiatric symptoms during extended alcohol-free periods (over 4 weeks)*** [1]
- ***First-degree biological relative has documented psychiatric disorder*** [1]

#### Specific Comorbidities [1][2]

| Comorbidity | Prevalence | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| ***Mood disorders*** | ***40% of alcoholics*** [2] | ***Depression: most common comorbidity; alcoholism may be self-medication. 4× risk of major depression in patients with Hx of alcohol dependence*** [2] |
| ***Bipolar I disorder*** | ***60% of bipolar I patients have alcoholism*** [1] | ***Manic episodes → hyperexcitability and impulsivity → ↑ alcohol intake. Alcoholism aggravates bipolar disorder and a/w ↑ suicide rate*** [2] |
| ***Antisocial personality*** | ***14% of alcoholics, but 80% of antisocial personality patients suffer from alcoholism*** [1] | Strong bidirectional association |
| ***Schizophrenia*** | ***30% abuse alcohol*** [1] | ***Alcohol ↓ feeling of isolation and temporarily ↓ symptoms of anxiety/depression/insomnia. BUT ↑ psychotic symptoms and mood swings, disruptive behaviour, suicide, treatment non-compliance, drug abuse, poor clinical outcome, drug accumulation due to hepatic damage*** [1] |
| ***Anxiety disorders*** | ***32% of alcoholics*** [2] | May be self-medication (anxiolytic effect). ***Must be distinguished from alcohol withdrawal syndrome*** [2] |
| ***Drug abuse*** | ***20% of drug abusers are alcoholic; alcoholics are 6× more prone to become drug abusers*** [1] | Cross-reinforcement through shared dopaminergic pathways |

***Alcohol-related mood disorders*** [2]:
- ***Moderate/heavy alcohol use*** can cause mood disorders
- ***Major depression: 4× risk in patients with Hx of alcohol dependence*** [2]
- ***Rarely easy to untangle cause and effect*** between mood disorder and alcoholism [2]
- ***Response to treatment is much less likely if comorbid alcoholism is NOT dealt with*** [2]
- ***Mx: abstinence (clears up upon abstinence but may persist for up to 4 weeks afterwards)*** [2]

***Alcohol-related anxiety disorders*** [2]:
- ***Any form of anxiety (GAD, phobic anxiety, OCD…) while on heavy alcohol consumption*** [2]
- ***Must be distinguished from alcohol withdrawal syndrome*** [2]
- ***Mx: abstinence (subside gradually, but may persist up to 6 months)*** [2]

## Approach to Potential Alcohol Misuse [2]

### When to Be Alert [2]

***Alert to potential alcohol misuse in the following situations*** [2]:
- ***General:*** issues with ADL, family/work, finances, law (***especially if frequent absences on Monday*** — because weekend binge → Monday withdrawal/hangover)
- ***Medical:*** intoxication, withdrawal, other medical consequences of alcohol
- ***Psychiatric:*** anxiety, depression, erratic moods, ↓ concentration/memory lapses, DSH/suicide

### Screening Tools [2]

| Tool | Details |
|---|---|
| ***CAGE questionnaire*** | ***↑ Sensitivity but modest specificity only*** [2]. 4 questions: **C**ut down, **A**nnoyed by criticism, **G**uilty, **E**ye-opener (morning drink). ≥ 2 positive = screen positive. |
| ***AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test)*** | ***↑ Sensitivity + ↑ Specificity, probably most useful*** [2]. ***10-item screening tool by WHO*** [2]. Covers consumption, dependence symptoms, and alcohol-related problems. Score ≥ 8 = hazardous drinking. |

### Drinking History [2]

A comprehensive drinking history ***should include*** [2]:
- ***Initiation:*** reason for drinking, triggers, when did daily drinking start
- ***Use:*** current, regular, maximal use, describe a ***typical day*** (***especially note time of first drink*** — an early morning drink strongly suggests dependence/relief drinking)
- ***Signs/symptoms of dependence:*** compulsion/craving, difficulty in control behaviour, stereotyped behaviour, tolerance, withdrawal, persistent use despite negative consequences, neglect of other interests and activities
- ***Impact:*** physical, mental health, ADL, family, work, social relationships
- ***Quitting:*** dates and reasons of abstinence, dates and reasons of relapses, attitude

### Laboratory Investigations [2]

***Laboratory features of chronic alcoholism include*** [2]:

| Test | Sensitivity | Key Points |

| ***↑ GGT*** | ***70%*** | ***Useful screening tool but non-specific, dose-related*** [2]. Also elevated in liver disease of any cause, obesity, medications (e.g. anticonvulsants). Normalises within 2–6 weeks of abstinence. |
| ***↑ MCV*** | ***60%*** | ***More commonly in females; strong indicator of excessive drinking (once rule out other causes); takes weeks to return to baseline after abstinence*** [2]. Other causes: B12/folate deficiency, hypothyroidism, liver disease, myelodysplastic syndrome. |
| ***↑ CDT (carbohydrate-deficient transferrin)*** | Variable | ***More specific than GGT*** [2]. Ethanol interferes with glycosylation of transferrin. Particularly useful for monitoring relapse. |
| ***Breath/blood alcohol concentration*** | N/A | ***Only reflects current drinking*** [2]. Useful for acute management but not for detecting chronic misuse. |
| Other | - | LFTs (AST:ALT ratio > 2:1 is classic for alcoholic liver disease — because mitochondrial AST is released preferentially); FBC (↑MCV, ↓platelets); U&E (↓K⁺, ↓Mg²⁺, ↓PO₄³⁻); lipid profile; uric acid |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Key Concepts:**
1. **1 unit in HK = 10g pure ethanol**; safe limits = 2 units/day (M), 1 unit/day (F)
2. **Neuropharmacology**: Alcohol = GABA-A potentiator + NMDA inhibitor + ↑ mesolimbic DA. Chronic use → GABA-A downregulation + NMDA upregulation. Withdrawal = excitotoxic state.
3. **ALDH2*2 mutation** is common in Asians → protective against alcoholism (flush reaction) but ↑ cancer risk if they do drink
4. **Cloninger Type 1** (later onset, both sexes, mild genetics) vs **Type 2** (early onset, male, strong genetics, antisocial)
5. **Withdrawal timeline**: Tremor (6–12h) → Hallucinosis (12–24h) → Seizures (12–48h) → DT (48–72h). Each successive withdrawal is worse (kindling).
6. **Wernicke triad**: Confusion + Ophthalmoplegia + Ataxia. Give IV thiamine BEFORE or WITH glucose. Only 10% have full triad — maintain a low threshold.
7. **Korsakoff**: Anterograde amnesia + confabulation. Mamillary bodies + medial thalamus damage. Largely irreversible.
8. **6 causes of confusion in alcoholism**: Intoxication, Withdrawal/DT, Wernicke, Hepatic encephalopathy, Hypoglycaemia, Subdural haematoma
9. **Psychiatric comorbidity in 55% of alcoholics**: Depression (40%), Bipolar I (60% of bipolar patients), Antisocial PD (80% of ASPD patients), Schizophrenia (30%), Anxiety (32%)
10. **Diagnosing comorbid psych disorder**: psychiatric disorder before alcohol onset, persistent symptoms during ≥ 4 weeks alcohol-free, FHx of psychiatric disorder
11. **Screening**: AUDIT (best — ↑ sensitivity + specificity, 10-item WHO tool) > CAGE (↑ sensitivity only)
12. **Lab markers**: ↑GGT (70%, non-specific), ↑MCV (60%, weeks to normalise), ↑CDT (most specific)

      question: "Name the 6 causes of confusion in alcoholism that must be considered in the differential diagnosis.",
      markscheme: "1. Acute intoxication, 2. Alcohol withdrawal or delirium tremens, 3. Wernicke encephalopathy (thiamine deficiency), 4. Hepatic encephalopathy (hyperammonaemia), 5. Hypoglycaemia (impaired gluconeogenesis), 6. Subdural haematoma (falls plus coagulopathy)."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain the GABA-glutamate seesaw model of alcohol withdrawal pathophysiology.",
      markscheme: "Chronic alcohol potentiates GABA-A (inhibitory) and blocks NMDA (excitatory). Brain compensates by downregulating GABA-A receptors and upregulating NMDA receptors. On sudden cessation, reduced GABAergic inhibition plus excessive NMDA-mediated excitation causes CNS hyperexcitability manifesting as tremor, seizures, autonomic storm, and delirium tremens."
    },
    {
      question: "A patient presents confused after heavy drinking. You suspect Wernicke encephalopathy. What is the classic triad, what is the treatment, and why must you give thiamine before or with glucose?",
      markscheme: "Triad: confusion, ophthalmoplegia (especially CN VI palsy), ataxia. Only 10% have full triad. Treatment: IV thiamine 500mg TDS for 3 days. Rationale: glucose loading in a thiamine-deficient cell diverts remaining thiamine to glycolysis, worsening energy failure in thiamine-dependent TCA cycle enzymes, potentially causing lactic acidosis and precipitating or worsening Wernicke encephalopathy."
    },
    {
      question: "Compare Cloninger Type 1 and Type 2 alcoholism in terms of age of onset, genetic influence, sex distribution, and personality traits.",
      markscheme: "Type 1: later onset, mildly genetic, both sexes, harm-avoidant and anxious personality, influenced by environment. Type 2: early onset (before age 25), strongly genetic, predominantly male, novelty-seeking personality, associated with criminality and antisocial personality disorder, less influenced by environment."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the criteria supporting the diagnosis of a comorbid primary psychiatric disorder in a patient with alcoholism?",
      markscheme: "1. Evidence of psychiatric disorder before onset of alcohol abuse or dependence. 2. Persistent psychiatric symptoms during extended alcohol-free periods (over 4 weeks). 3. First-degree biological relative has a documented psychiatric disorder."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is the ALDH2*2 mutation clinically significant in the Hong Kong population, and how does it relate to the mechanism of disulfiram?",
      markscheme: "ALDH2*2 is an inactivating mutation common in East Asians (30-40%) that impairs acetaldehyde metabolism, causing accumulation of toxic acetaldehyde after drinking, leading to flushing, nausea, and tachycardia. This acts as a protective factor against alcoholism. Disulfiram works by the same principle: it inhibits ALDH, causing acetaldehyde accumulation and aversive symptoms, creating negative reinforcement against drinking. However, ALDH2*2 carriers who drink are at higher risk of oesophageal and head and neck cancers because acetaldehyde is a carcinogen."
