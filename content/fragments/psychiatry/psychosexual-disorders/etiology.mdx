# Psychosexual Disorders

## 1. Definition and Overview

**Psychosexual disorders** encompass a broad group of conditions in which psychological factors significantly affect sexual functioning, sexual preference, or gender experience. The term itself breaks down neatly: "psycho-" (Greek: *psykhē* = mind) + "sexual" (Latin: *sexualis* = relating to sex) — disorders where the mind and sexuality intersect.

They are broadly classified into three major categories [1][2]:

1. **Sexual dysfunctions** — impaired or unsatisfying sexual enjoyment or performance (i.e., something goes wrong in the normal sexual response cycle)
2. **Paraphilias** (Greek: *para-* = beside/abnormal + *philia* = love/attraction) — abnormalities of sexual preference that pose harm or mental distress to self or others
3. **Gender dysphoria** (Greek: *dys-* = bad/difficult + *phoria* = bearing/feeling) — persistent discomfort with one's biologic sex or assigned gender, where gender identity varies from biological sex

<Callout title="Key Conceptual Framework">
Think of these three categories as mapping onto three different dimensions of sexuality:
- **Sexual function** → "Can I perform sexually?" (dysfunctions)
- **Sexual preference** → "What am I attracted to?" (paraphilias)
- **Gender identity** → "Who am I?" (gender dysphoria)

Each has distinct aetiology, assessment, and management approaches.

## 2. Epidemiology

### 2.1 Sexual Dysfunctions

- **Extremely common** — among the most prevalent psychiatric conditions, yet profoundly under-reported due to embarrassment, cultural taboo, and normalisation
- Global prevalence estimates:
  - **Female sexual dysfunction**: 40–50% of women report at least one sexual complaint; ~12% report distressing sexual dysfunction [3]
  - **Male sexual dysfunction**: ~31% of men report at least one sexual dysfunction
  - **Erectile disorder (ED)**: prevalence increases dramatically with age — ~5% at age 40, ~15–25% by age 65, >50% by age 75. In Hong Kong, community studies show prevalence of ~25–30% in men >40 years
  - **Premature ejaculation (PE)**: most common male sexual dysfunction, ~20–30% prevalence
  - **Female orgasmic disorder**: ~10–25% of women
  - **Hypoactive sexual desire disorder**: ~6–10% in men, higher in women (~10–15%)
- **Risk factors** accumulate with age: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, depression, medications (especially SSRIs, antihypertensives), relationship difficulties
- Sexual dysfunctions are significantly more prevalent in patients with **psychiatric disorders** — approximately **50% of patients with depression** have sexual dysfunction (from the disease itself AND/OR its treatment) [2]

### 2.2 Paraphilias

- **Predominantly male** — ALL paraphilias are mainly confined to males (except sexual masochism, which also occurs in females) [2]
- Usually begins in **late adolescence/early adulthood** [2]
- Prevalence is difficult to estimate (under-reporting, legal implications):
  - Exhibitionism and voyeurism are the most common paraphilias presenting to legal/clinical attention
  - Paedophilia: estimates ~3–5% of males, but true prevalence unknown
  - Most individuals with paraphilias never come to medical attention unless they encounter legal trouble or experience distress

### 2.3 Gender Dysphoria

- Prevalence: **~1 in 11,900–45,000 for male-to-female (MtF)**, **~1 in 30,400–200,000 for female-to-male (FtM)**, and approximately **0.5% in the general population** (these figures are rising with greater awareness and de-stigmatisation) [2]
- In Hong Kong, gender-affirming services are primarily provided through public hospital psychiatry departments (notably Queen Mary Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital), with increasing referral numbers over the past decade

## 3. Anatomy and Physiology of the Normal Sexual Response

### 3.1 Neuroanatomy of Sexual Function

Understanding psychosexual disorders requires understanding the normal machinery:

- **Central control**: The limbic system (amygdala, hypothalamus, cingulate cortex) integrates emotional, hormonal, and sensory inputs to modulate sexual desire and arousal
  - **Hypothalamus**: key relay — medial preoptic area (MPOA) is central to male sexual behaviour; ventromedial hypothalamus for female receptivity
  - **Prefrontal cortex**: provides inhibitory control (this is why disinhibiting conditions like frontal lobe dementia or alcohol can alter sexual behaviour)
  - **Dopaminergic pathways** (mesolimbic): promote sexual desire and arousal — this is why dopamine agonists (e.g., for Parkinson's disease) can cause hypersexuality
  - **Serotonergic pathways**: generally inhibitory to sexual function — this is why SSRIs cause sexual dysfunction (delayed orgasm, decreased libido)
  - **Noradrenergic pathways**: facilitate arousal and ejaculation

- **Peripheral nervous system**:
  - **Parasympathetic (S2–S4)**: mediates erection in males and vaginal lubrication/engorgement in females ("**P**oint = **P**arasympathetic" — erection is parasympathetic via pelvic splanchnic nerves → nitric oxide release → smooth muscle relaxation → vasodilation → engorgement)
  - **Sympathetic (T11–L2)**: mediates ejaculation in males ("**S**hoot = **S**ympathetic" — emission and ejaculation via hypogastric nerve)
  - **Somatic (pudendal nerve, S2–S4)**: mediates rhythmic contractions of perineal muscles during orgasm in both sexes

- **Hormonal axis**:
  - **Testosterone** (both sexes): primary driver of libido/sexual desire
  - **Oestrogen**: maintains vaginal lubrication and elasticity in females; contributes to libido
  - **Prolactin**: inhibits sexual desire and arousal (this is why hyperprolactinaemia from antipsychotics or pituitary adenomas causes sexual dysfunction)
  - **Oxytocin**: released during orgasm, promotes bonding

### 3.2 The Four-Phase Sexual Response Cycle (Masters & Johnson / Kaplan)

This is the foundational model for understanding sexual dysfunctions — each dysfunction maps onto a disruption of one or more phases [2]:

| Phase | What Happens | Physiology | Key Points |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Phase 1: Desire** | Sexual fantasies and desire to have sexual activity | Central (hypothalamic–limbic), modulated by testosterone, dopamine; inhibited by serotonin, prolactin | This is the "wanting" phase — purely psychological/neurochemical. Disrupted in hypoactive sexual desire disorder |
| **Phase 2: Excitement** | Subjective sense of sexual pleasure + accompanying physiological changes: erection in males, vaginal lubrication in females | Parasympathetic activation → NO release → vasodilation → engorgement. Vaginal transudation in females | Duration varies. Disrupted in erectile disorder, female sexual interest/arousal disorder |
| **Phase 3: Orgasm** | Peaking of sexual pleasure with release of tension + rhythmic contraction of perineal muscles and pelvic reproductive organs | Sympathetic + somatic: M — sensation of ejaculatory inevitability → ejaculation; F — contraction of outer 1/3 of vagina | Disrupted in premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, female orgasmic disorder |
| **Phase 4: Resolution** | Muscle relaxation, general well-being | Parasympathetic rebound, oxytocin/prolactin release | **Refractory period**: men are refractory to further erection and orgasm, but NOT women (women can have multiple orgasms without a refractory period) [2] |

<Callout title="High Yield — Male vs Female Response Curves">
The classic sexual response graph shows:
- **Males**: relatively stereotyped single peak → orgasm → distinct refractory period → resolution
- **Females**: more variable — can have multiple orgasms (no refractory period), or a plateau phase without reaching orgasm, or a gradual return to excitement without distinct refractory period [2]
</Callout>

## 4. Aetiology and Pathophysiology

### 4.1 Aetiology of Sexual Dysfunctions

Sexual dysfunctions are **almost always multifactorial** — a biopsychosocial model is essential [2]:

#### 4.1.1 Biological Factors

> "May date back to a period of abstinence from debilitation" [2] — i.e., an initial organic cause (e.g., post-MI, post-surgery) leads to a period of sexual inactivity, which then breeds performance anxiety and perpetuates the dysfunction even after the organic cause resolves.

- **Diabetes mellitus** — direct effect on sexual performance via:
  - **Vasculopathy**: microvascular disease → impaired penile blood flow → erectile dysfunction
  - **Autonomic neuropathy**: damages parasympathetic nerves (S2–S4) → impaired NO-mediated vasodilation → erectile dysfunction; also impairs vaginal lubrication in females
  - DM is the single most important medical cause of ED — up to 50% of diabetic men develop ED [2]

- **Drugs** (extremely high yield — always ask about medications!) [2]:
  | Drug Class | Examples | Mechanism of Sexual Dysfunction |
  |-----------|---------|-------------------------------|
  | Antihypertensives | **Beta-blockers, CCBs, spironolactone** | BB: ↓sympathetic drive → ↓arousal, ejaculatory difficulty; Spironolactone: anti-androgen effect → ↓libido, gynaecomastia, ED |
  | Antidepressants | **SSRIs, TCAs, MAOIs** | SSRIs: ↑serotonin → inhibits dopamine and NO pathways → delayed orgasm, ↓libido (most common cause of medication-induced SD); TCAs: anticholinergic → ↓arousal; MAOIs: multiple mechanisms |
  | Mood stabilisers | **Lithium** | Mechanism unclear; may affect thyroid function (hypothyroidism → ↓libido) |
  | Anxiolytics | **Benzodiazepines** | CNS depression → ↓arousal, ↓desire |
  | Antipsychotics | **FGA and SGA** | Dopamine blockade → hyperprolactinaemia → ↓libido, ED, anorgasmia; also anticholinergic and anti-alpha-adrenergic effects |
  | Antihistamines | **H1 blockers, H2RAs** | Anticholinergic effects → ↓arousal |
  | Parkinson's medications | **Dopamine agonists** | Paradoxically can cause hypersexuality (↑dopamine in mesolimbic pathway) — a paraphilia-like presentation |
  | Drugs of abuse | **Alcohol, heroin, stimulants, marijuana** | Alcohol: CNS depressant, ↓testosterone with chronic use; Heroin: ↓GnRH → ↓testosterone; Stimulants: acute ↑then chronic ↓function; Marijuana: ↓testosterone |

- **Other organic causes** [2]:
  - ED of various causes (vascular, neurogenic, hormonal, anatomical)
  - Menopausal changes (↓oestrogen → vaginal atrophy, ↓lubrication, dyspareunia)
  - Neurologic disorders (spinal cord injury, MS, stroke)
  - Endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinaemia, hypogonadism)
  - Cardiovascular disease (shared risk factors with ED — both are endothelial dysfunction)

<Callout title="ED as a Sentinel Marker" type="idea">
Erectile dysfunction often precedes cardiovascular events by 3–5 years. Penile arteries (1–2mm diameter) are smaller than coronary arteries (3–4mm), so endothelial dysfunction manifests earlier in the penis. Always screen for cardiovascular risk factors in a man presenting with ED.
</Callout>

#### 4.1.2 Psychological Factors [2]

- **Negative body image or performance anxiety** — the most common perpetuating factor. A man who has one episode of ED becomes anxious about the next encounter → sympathetic overdrive → vasoconstriction → ED → reinforces anxiety (a vicious cycle)
- **Ambivalent attitude about sex/intimacy**: anxiety, fear, guilt, shame — often rooted in upbringing, cultural, or religious attitudes (particularly relevant in Hong Kong where traditional Chinese and religious values may create conflict)
- **Fear of consequences**: pregnancy, STDs
- **History of rape or childhood sexual abuse** — can cause lifelong aversion, vaginismus, or arousal difficulties
- **Psychiatric disorders, especially depression** (~50% have sexual dysfunction — from the disease itself [↓libido, anhedonia] or medications [SSRIs]) [2]

#### 4.1.3 Sociocultural Factors [2]

- **Relationship dynamics**: poor or deteriorating relationship, communication difficulties, power inequalities — "sex is the barometer of a relationship"
- **Environment**: lack of privacy (very relevant in Hong Kong with cramped living conditions, multi-generational households), disparate work schedules (long working hours culture)
- **Sociocultural influence**: sex role expectations, religious proscriptions, cultural taboos about discussing sex openly
- In **Hong Kong specifically**: Confucian values around modesty, shame about discussing sexual matters, traditional gender role expectations, and high work stress all contribute to both the prevalence and under-reporting of sexual dysfunctions

### 4.2 Aetiology of Paraphilias

The aetiology is **unknown**, but several hypotheses have been proposed [2]:

| Model | Explanation |
|-------|------------|
| **Behavioural model** | Sexual preference is shaped by events and reinforcement during development — e.g., if an early sexual experience is paired with an atypical stimulus, classical conditioning may establish that stimulus as arousing |
| **Psychoanalytic model** | Castration anxiety not resolved in childhood → fetish object represents the phallus (Freudian theory — largely historical, not evidence-based) |
| **Biological model** | Abnormal brain activity/structure, genetic predisposition — some neuroimaging studies show altered frontal-temporal function in paedophilia |
| **Disease model** | Those beginning **late in life** may be secondary to dementia, other organic disorders, and their treatment (e.g., **dopamine agonist for Parkinson's disease** is associated with abnormal sexual behaviours — hypersexuality, paraphilia-like behaviours) [2] |

<Callout title="Late-Onset Paraphilia = Think Organic" type="error">
If a previously normal individual develops paraphilic behaviour in middle or old age, ALWAYS consider an organic cause: frontal lobe dementia, brain tumour (especially orbitofrontal), Parkinson's disease treatment (dopamine agonists), or other disinhibiting conditions.
</Callout>

### 4.3 Aetiology of Gender Dysphoria [2]

- **Genetic**: 39% monozygotic twin concordance rate — indicates significant genetic contribution but not deterministic
- **Atypical brain differentiation**:
  - Natal males (MtF, homosexual subtype): brain structure dissimilar to cisgender males in grey matter volume, cortical thickness, and white matter microstructure — brain more closely resembles cisgender females in some regions
  - Natal females (FtM): increased grey matter volumes compared to cisgender females
  - **Postulated mechanism**: prenatal sex hormone influence on brain development — the "brain sex theory" suggests that gender identity is determined partly by in-utero hormonal exposure, which can be discordant with gonadal sex
- **Psychosocial processes**:
  - Gender identity is thought to be **fully formed by 3 years of age** [2]
  - May be subject to **influence from the psychosocial environment** — gender identity has been shown to be more fluid in some children and adults [2]
- **Associated disorders**: significantly **increased comorbid Axis I disorders**, especially mood and anxiety disorders [2] — though debate exists about whether these are inherent vs. secondary to minority stress and discrimination

## 5. Classification

### 5.1 Classification of Sexual Dysfunctions

> Note: ICD-11 (current) and DSM-5-TR are the classification systems to know. ICD-10 is being phased out but still referenced in some Hong Kong settings.

| DSM-5-TR | ICD-10 (Legacy) | Phase Affected |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Sexual desire/arousal disorders** | | |
| Female sexual interest/arousal disorder | Lack or loss of sexual desire; Sexual aversion | Desire/Excitement |
| Male hypoactive sexual desire disorder | Lack or loss of sexual desire | Desire |
| Erectile disorder | Failure of genital response | Excitement |
| **Orgasm disorders** | | |
| Female orgasmic disorder | Orgasmic dysfunction | Orgasm |
| Delayed ejaculation | Orgasmic dysfunction | Orgasm |
| Premature ejaculation | Premature ejaculation | Orgasm |
| **Sexual pain disorders** | | |
| Genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder | Nonorganic dyspareunia; Nonorganic vaginismus | Pain-related |
| **Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction** | — | Any phase |

[2]

Additional important classification distinctions:
- **Lifelong vs. Acquired**: Was the problem always present, or did it develop after a period of normal function?
- **Generalised vs. Situational**: Does it occur in all situations, or only specific ones? (e.g., a man who cannot get an erection with his partner but has normal morning erections and erections during masturbation → likely psychogenic, not organic)
- **Severity**: mild, moderate, severe

### 5.2 Classification of Paraphilias [2]

Paraphilias are broadly classified into two groups:

| Abnormalities of **Object** of Sexual Interest | Abnormalities of the **Sexual Act** |
|:---|:---|
| **Paedophilia**: sexual fantasies/urges/behaviours involving children ( < 13 years; individual must be ≥ 16 and ≥ 5 years older than child) | **Exhibitionism**: exposure of genitals to unsuspecting strangers (typically for the shock reaction) |
| **Fetishism**: involving inanimate objects or non-erogenous body parts (e.g., shoes, leather, feet) | **Voyeurism**: observing unsuspecting people engaging in sexual activity or undressing |
| **Transvestic fetishism**: involving cross-dressing (sexual arousal from wearing opposite-sex clothing — NOT the same as gender dysphoria) | **Frotteurism** (French: *frotter* = to rub): rubbing genitalia against another person or fondling breasts of unwilling person (e.g., on crowded public transport — relevant in Hong Kong MTR context) |
| **Zoophilia** (bestiality): involving animals | **Sexual sadism** (from Marquis de Sade): infliction of physical or psychological suffering/humiliation on others |
| **Necrophilia** (Greek: *nekros* = dead + *philia* = love): involving corpses | **Sexual masochism** (from Leopold von Sacher-Masoch): infliction of suffering/humiliation on oneself |

<Callout title="Paraphilia vs Paraphilic Disorder" type="error">
**DSM-5 makes an important distinction**: Having a paraphilia (atypical sexual interest) is NOT in itself a disorder. It becomes a **paraphilic disorder** only when:
1. It causes clinically significant distress or impairment in the individual, OR
2. It involves personal harm or risk of harm to others (e.g., paedophilia, exhibitionism, frotteurism)

This distinction is crucial — it de-pathologises atypical sexual interests that are consensual and non-distressing.
</Callout>

### 5.3 Classification of Gender Dysphoria [2]

- **DSM-5**: "Gender Dysphoria" (renamed from "Gender Identity Disorder" in DSM-IV to emphasise **emotional distress** from incongruence rather than pathologising the identity itself) [2]
- **ICD-11**: "Gender Incongruence" — moved OUT of the mental disorders chapter and into "Conditions related to sexual health" → a landmark de-psychiatrisation move
- Subtypes:
  - Gender dysphoria in children
  - Gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults

## 6. Clinical Features

### 6.1 Sexual Dysfunctions — Symptoms and Signs

The clinical features of each sexual dysfunction are best understood by mapping them to the affected phase of the sexual response cycle:

#### 6.1.1 Disorders of Desire

**Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder / Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder**

*Symptoms*:
- **Absent or reduced sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity** — patients report "not thinking about sex," "not interested," or "could go without it"
  - *Pathophysiology*: ↓dopaminergic/testosterone drive centrally (organic) OR psychological inhibition (depression, relationship conflict, cultural attitudes)
  - Distinguish from **sexual aversion disorder** (ICD-10) where there is active avoidance and disgust, often linked to trauma history
- In females (DSM-5 combined interest/arousal): additionally reduced/absent initiation of sexual activity, reduced excitement/pleasure during sex, reduced genital/non-genital sensations
- Must be **persistent** (≥ 6 months in DSM-5) and cause **clinically significant distress**

*Signs*:
- Often no physical signs — diagnosis is primarily clinical/history-based
- May find signs of underlying cause: features of hypogonadism (↓body hair, gynaecomastia, small testes in males), hypothyroidism, depression

#### 6.1.2 Disorders of Excitement

**Erectile Disorder**

*Symptoms*:
- **Inability to attain or maintain an adequate erection** during sexual activity
  - *Pathophysiology*: Erection requires intact parasympathetic input (S2–S4) → pelvic splanchnic nerves → cavernous nerves → NO release from endothelium → cGMP → smooth muscle relaxation in corpora cavernosa → arterial inflow ↑ → venous compression against tunica albuginea → rigidity. Disruption at ANY point causes ED:
    - Vascular: atherosclerosis, DM vasculopathy → ↓arterial inflow
    - Neurogenic: DM neuropathy, spinal cord injury → ↓NO release
    - Hormonal: ↓testosterone, ↑prolactin → ↓central drive
    - Psychogenic: anxiety → ↑sympathetic tone → vasoconstriction → overrides parasympathetic vasodilation

- **Key distinguishing feature** — psychogenic vs organic ED:

| Feature | Psychogenic | Organic |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Onset | Sudden | Gradual |
| Situational? | Yes (e.g., works with masturbation, morning erections preserved) | No (absent in all situations) |
| Morning erections | Present | Absent |
| Relationship to stress | Closely linked | Not linked |
| Age | Younger (typically < 40) | Older (typically > 40) |
| Associated factors | Depression, anxiety, relationship problems | DM, CVD, medications, smoking |

*Signs*:
- Vascular: ↓peripheral pulses, bruits, retinopathy (fundoscopy)
- Neurogenic: ↓perineal sensation, ↓bulbocavernosus reflex, peripheral neuropathy signs
- Hormonal: gynaecomastia, ↓testicular volume, ↓body hair, visual field defects (pituitary tumour)

**Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder** (excitement component):
- **Absent or reduced vaginal lubrication and engorgement** during sexual activity
  - *Pathophysiology*: parasympathetic-mediated vasodilation → vaginal transudation (plasma filtrate through vaginal epithelium). Disrupted by ↓oestrogen (menopause), autonomic neuropathy, medications (anticholinergics), psychological factors

#### 6.1.3 Disorders of Orgasm

**Premature (Early) Ejaculation**

- **Most common male sexual dysfunction** (~20–30% prevalence)
- *Symptoms*: ejaculation occurring within ~1 minute of vaginal penetration (lifelong) or ≤ 3 minutes (acquired), with inability to delay ejaculation, causing distress
  - *Pathophysiology*: believed to involve serotonergic dysfunction — low 5-HT (serotonin) at the level of the ejaculatory centre in the lumbosacral spinal cord → lowered ejaculatory threshold. This is why SSRIs (which ↑serotonin) are a mainstay of pharmacological treatment
  - Also: heightened sympathetic reactivity, penile hypersensitivity, performance anxiety

**Delayed Ejaculation**

- *Symptoms*: marked delay in, or inability to achieve ejaculation despite adequate stimulation and desire
  - *Pathophysiology*: ↑serotonergic inhibition (most commonly SSRI-induced), ↓sympathetic input (alpha-blockers, spinal cord injury), psychological inhibition

**Female Orgasmic Disorder**

- *Symptoms*: marked delay in, infrequency of, or absence of orgasm, or markedly reduced intensity
  - *Pathophysiology*: complex interplay — requires intact sensory input (pudendal nerve) + adequate arousal + central processing. Common causes: SSRIs (↑serotonin → ↓dopamine → ↓orgasm threshold), psychological factors (inability to "let go," anxiety), inadequate stimulation

#### 6.1.4 Sexual Pain Disorders

**Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder** (DSM-5 merges dyspareunia and vaginismus) [2]

*Dyspareunia component*:
- *Symptoms*: **persistent genital pain associated with sexual intercourse** in either sex (though predominantly female)
  - **Superficial (introital) pain** [2]:
    - Inadequate vaginal lubrication (insufficient arousal, menopausal atrophic vaginitis) → friction → pain
    - Vaginal scarring (from episiotomy, surgery)
    - Painful lesions (Bartholin's cyst, vulvitis, herpes)
    - Muscle spasms of vaginismus
  - **Deep pain** [2]:
    - Pelvic pathologies: endometriosis, ovarian cysts, tumours, pelvic inflammatory disease
    - Retroverted uterus
  - *Pathophysiology*: pain leads to anticipatory anxiety → sympathetic activation → ↓lubrication, ↑muscle tension → more pain (vicious cycle)

*Vaginismus component* [2]:
- **Involuntary spasm of the vaginal muscles resulting in pain when attempting intercourse**, occurring in the absence of a physical cause
- Usually part of a **phobic response to penetration** — may be worsened by an inexperienced partner
- Begins as soon as the man attempts to enter the vagina [2]
- *Pathophysiology*: conditioned fear response → anticipatory anxiety → pelvic floor muscle contraction (levator ani, pubococcygeus) → pain → reinforcement of fear

---

### 6.2 Paraphilias — Clinical Features [2]

The cardinal feature across all paraphilias is **recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, urges, or behaviours** involving atypical stimuli, **over a period of ≥ 6 months**.

| Paraphilia | Core Clinical Feature | Pathophysiological Basis/Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Paedophilia** | Sexual fantasies/urges/behaviours involving **prepubescent children** | Most have a **specific age/gender preference**; highest recidivism among paraphilias; often comorbid with other paraphilias |
| **Fetishism** | Sexual arousal from **inanimate objects** or **non-genital body parts** | Behavioural conditioning model: object becomes paired with sexual arousal during formative years |
| **Transvestic fetishism** | Sexual arousal from **cross-dressing** | Distinct from gender dysphoria — here the cross-dressing is specifically for sexual arousal, not gender expression; some may develop gender dysphoria over time |
| **Exhibitionism** | Exposure of genitals to **unsuspecting strangers** | The arousal comes from the victim's **shock reaction**, not from actual sexual contact |
| **Voyeurism** | Observing **unsuspecting people** undressing/engaging in sex | The secrecy and violation of privacy is the source of arousal |
| **Frotteurism** | Rubbing/touching an **unwilling** person | Typically in crowded settings (e.g., public transport) — relevant to Hong Kong context |
| **Sexual sadism** | Inflicting **suffering/humiliation** on another person | In extreme cases may overlap with forensic populations (e.g., sexual homicide) |
| **Sexual masochism** | Inflicting **suffering/humiliation** on oneself | **Only paraphilia not predominantly male**; risk of accidental injury/death (e.g., autoerotic asphyxiation) |

- **Red flags for paraphilic disorders**:
  - Acting on urges with non-consenting persons
  - Significant distress or functional impairment
  - Escalation in frequency or severity
  - Comorbid substance use (disinhibition)
  - Forensic/legal involvement

### 6.3 Gender Dysphoria — Clinical Features [2]

**In Children**:
- Strong, persistent **cross-gender identification**: insistence on being the other gender, preference for cross-sex roles in play, preference for toys/activities/playmates typically associated with the other gender, strong dislike of one's sexual anatomy
- Note: many children with gender non-conforming behaviour do NOT persist into adolescence/adulthood — desistance rates in older studies were reported as 60–80%, though this is debated and may reflect broader gender nonconformity rather than true gender dysphoria. Gender identity is thought to be **fully formed by age 3** [2]

**In Adolescents/Adults**:
- **Persistent discomfort with one's biological sex** or assigned gender
- Strong desire to be of the other gender (or an alternative gender)
- Strong desire to be rid of one's primary and/or secondary sex characteristics
- Strong desire for the primary/secondary sex characteristics of the other gender
- Strong desire to be treated as the other gender
- Strong conviction that one has the typical feelings/reactions of the other gender
- Must cause **clinically significant distress or impairment** in social, occupational, or other functioning

*Signs*:
- May present in preferred gender clothing/appearance
- May already be living in the preferred gender role
- May show signs of self-harm, depression, or anxiety (high rates of comorbid mood/anxiety disorders) [2]
- In Hong Kong: patients may present late due to cultural stigma, family pressure, and lack of awareness of services

<Callout title="DSM-5 Renamed to Emphasise Distress, Not Identity" type="idea">
The rename from "Gender Identity Disorder" (DSM-IV) to "Gender Dysphoria" (DSM-5) was deliberate — it emphasises that the disorder is the **emotional distress** from the incongruence, NOT the gender identity itself. Being transgender is NOT a mental illness. ICD-11 takes this further by reclassifying "Gender Incongruence" entirely out of mental disorders. [2]
</Callout>

## 7. Approach to Assessment

### 7.1 Approach to Sexual Dysfunction [2]

**Clinical assessment**: thorough, sensitive, ideally with partner present

**History** [2]:
1. **Define the problem clearly**: Which phase is affected? Is it lifelong or acquired? Generalised or situational?
2. **Sexual history** (including outside of intercourse):
   - Morning erections? (preserved = likely psychogenic)
   - Masturbation — can achieve erection/orgasm alone? (if yes → psychogenic)
   - Frequency, duration, satisfaction
3. **Psychiatric history**: depression (anhedonia → ↓desire), anxiety (performance anxiety), PTSD (sexual trauma)
4. **Past medical history**: DM, CVD, neurological disease, surgery (prostatectomy, pelvic surgery)
5. **Drug history**: SSRIs, antihypertensives, antipsychotics, recreational drugs, alcohol
6. **Relationship history**: quality, communication, partner's perspective

**Physical Examination** [2]:
- **Vasculopathy**: BP/pulse, fundoscopy (diabetic retinopathy), peripheral pulses
- **Neuropathy**: reflexes (including bulbocavernosus reflex), sensation (perineal/lower limb)
- **Hormonal**: hair distribution, gynaecomastia, thyroid examination
- **Genitals**: male genital examination (testicular size/consistency, penile plaques [Peyronie's]), female pelvic examination (atrophic vaginitis, pelvic masses)

**Investigations** [2]:
- Blood: renal function, liver function, alcohol level, TFT, pituitary hormones (including prolactin), sex hormone profile (testosterone, oestradiol, FSH, LH, SHBG)
- Specialist: nocturnal penile tumescence testing (distinguishes organic from psychogenic ED), penile Doppler ultrasound (vascular ED)

---

## 8. Key Specific Conditions — Additional Detail

### 8.1 Vaginismus — Treatment Detail [2]

- **Treated by psychotherapy with gradual desensitisation** [2]:
  1. Education about anatomy and the condition
  2. Relaxation techniques (progressive muscle relaxation, breathing)
  3. **Gradual exposure**: patient inserts own finger into vagina → then dilators of increasing size → eventually partner involvement
  4. Concurrent couples therapy to address relationship dynamics
- The principle: break the conditioned fear–pain–spasm cycle through systematic desensitisation (same principle as treating phobias)

### 8.2 Sensate Focus — Key Sex Therapy Technique [2]

> Sensate focus is a **series of graded tasks** — a hierarchical series of structured touching opportunities with a focus on **what must NOT yet be done** and what is to be done → this significantly **reduces performance anxiety** [2]

- **Stage 1**: Non-genital touching only (explore partner's body, focus on sensation, NOT on arousal or performance)
- **Stage 2**: Include genital touching but NO intercourse
- **Stage 3**: Gradual progression to intercourse
- Key principles:
  - Partners treated **together** [2]
  - Helped to **communicate better** about sexual relationship [2]
  - **Education on anatomy and physiology** of sexual intercourse [2]
  - The "ban" on intercourse in early stages paradoxically reduces anxiety because there's no pressure to perform

---

## 9. Hong Kong–Specific Considerations

- **Cultural factors**: Confucian values, modesty, shame about sexual topics → late presentation, under-reporting
- **Living conditions**: small flats, multi-generational living → lack of privacy → environmental contributor to sexual dysfunction
- **Work culture**: extremely long hours → fatigue, stress, ↓quality time with partner
- **Traditional medicine**: many patients may seek Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for sexual dysfunction before presenting to Western medicine
- **Legal considerations for paraphilias**: exhibitionism, frotteurism, and voyeurism are criminal offences under Hong Kong law (Crimes Ordinance). Paedophilia is prosecuted under various ordinances including the Crimes Ordinance and Protection of Children and Juveniles Ordinance
- **Gender dysphoria services**: limited public sector services (primarily QMH/PWH psychiatry), long waiting times; hormone therapy and surgery require rigorous psychiatric assessment; legal gender change requires full sex reassignment surgery in Hong Kong (the "W" case 2013 landmark ruling established that post-operative transgender individuals can marry in their affirmed gender)

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Psychosexual Disorders — Key Points:**

1. **Three categories**: Sexual dysfunctions (functional problem), Paraphilias (abnormal preference), Gender Dysphoria (identity–sex mismatch)

2. **Sexual Response Cycle** (4 phases): Desire → Excitement → Orgasm → Resolution. Each sexual dysfunction maps to a specific phase disruption.

3. **Refractory period exists in males only** — females can have multiple orgasms.

4. **Aetiology of sexual dysfunction is ALWAYS biopsychosocial**: Biological (DM is #1 organic cause of ED, medications — especially SSRIs/antihypertensives/antipsychotics), Psychological (performance anxiety creates a vicious cycle, depression — 50% have SD), Sociocultural (relationship, environment, cultural)

5. **Psychogenic vs Organic ED**: Preserved morning erections + situational dysfunction = psychogenic.

6. **Paraphilias**: ALL mainly in males (except masochism). Late-onset = think organic (dementia, dopamine agonists). Paraphilia ≠ disorder unless causing distress/harm.

7. **Gender Dysphoria**: Gender identity formed by age 3; 39% MZ concordance; atypical brain differentiation from prenatal sex hormones; management follows SOC guidelines (psychological assessment → counselling → real-life experience → hormones → surgery). NOT about making identity match assigned sex.

8. **Assessment of SD**: Define the problem, sexual Hx (morning erections, masturbation), PMHx, drug Hx, examination (vasculopathy, neuropathy, hormonal, genitals), investigations (hormones, TFT, prolactin).

9. **Sensate Focus**: graded touching tasks, ban on intercourse initially → reduces performance anxiety.

10. **Vaginismus**: phobic response → muscle spasm → gradual desensitisation with dilators.

      question: "Name the 4 phases of the sexual response cycle and state which autonomic division mediates erection versus ejaculation.",
      markscheme: "Phases: Desire, Excitement, Orgasm, Resolution. Erection = Parasympathetic (S2-S4, via NO and cGMP). Ejaculation = Sympathetic (T11-L2). Mnemonic: Point = Parasympathetic, Shoot = Sympathetic.",
    },
    {
      question: "A 55-year-old man with diabetes presents with erectile dysfunction. Explain TWO pathophysiological mechanisms by which DM causes ED.",
      markscheme: "1. Vasculopathy: microvascular disease causes impaired penile arterial blood flow, reducing engorgement. 2. Autonomic neuropathy: damage to parasympathetic nerves (S2-S4) impairs NO-mediated smooth muscle relaxation in corpora cavernosa, preventing erection.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you distinguish psychogenic from organic erectile dysfunction clinically? Give 3 features.",
      markscheme: "Psychogenic: sudden onset, situational (works with masturbation or different partner), preserved morning erections, younger age, linked to stress/relationship issues. Organic: gradual onset, consistent across all situations, absent morning erections, older age, associated with DM/CVD/medications.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why do SSRIs cause sexual dysfunction, and which phase(s) of the sexual response cycle are most affected?",
      markscheme: "SSRIs increase serotonin, which inhibits dopaminergic and NO-mediated pathways centrally. Most affected: Desire phase (decreased libido) and Orgasm phase (delayed or absent orgasm). Can also reduce arousal/excitement.",
    },
    {
      question: "A 70-year-old man with Parkinson's disease on pramipexole develops new-onset exhibitionistic behaviour. What is the likely mechanism and what category of paraphilia aetiology does this fall under?",
      markscheme: "Mechanism: Dopamine agonist (pramipexole) increases dopamine in mesolimbic reward pathway, causing disinhibition and hypersexuality/paraphilic behaviour. Falls under the Disease Model of paraphilia aetiology: late-onset paraphilia secondary to treatment of organic disorder.",
    },
    {
      question: "State 3 key aetiological factors for gender dysphoria and explain why DSM-5 renamed Gender Identity Disorder to Gender Dysphoria.",
      markscheme: "Aetiology: 1. Genetic (39% MZ concordance). 2. Atypical brain differentiation (prenatal sex hormone influence causing brain structure discordant with gonadal sex). 3. Psychosocial (gender identity formed by age 3, influenced by psychosocial environment). Renamed to emphasise that the disorder is the emotional distress from incongruence, not the gender identity itself. Being transgender is not a mental illness.",
