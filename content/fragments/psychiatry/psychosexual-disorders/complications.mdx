## Complications of Psychosexual Disorders

Complications of psychosexual disorders operate on multiple levels — the disorder itself causes psychological and relational harm, and the treatments carry their own risks. Think of this in a structured way: complications of the condition (untreated and treated), complications of treatment, and complications arising from societal/legal consequences.

### 1. Complications of Sexual Dysfunctions

#### 1.1 Psychological Complications

| Complication | Mechanism / Why It Occurs | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Depression and anxiety** | Sexual dysfunction → frustration, shame, sense of inadequacy → depressed mood. A bidirectional relationship exists: **depression causes sexual dysfunction (~50% of depressed patients)** [2], and sexual dysfunction causes/worsens depression. Each reinforces the other in a vicious cycle | In men, ED is independently associated with a 2–3x increased risk of developing major depressive disorder. The relationship is particularly pernicious because SSRIs prescribed for depression then worsen sexual dysfunction → patient stops antidepressant → depression relapses |
| **Performance anxiety** | One episode of sexual failure (e.g., erectile failure, premature ejaculation) → anticipatory anxiety about the next encounter → sympathetic overdrive → vasoconstriction (males) or ↓lubrication (females) → failure → reinforced anxiety [2] | This is the most common perpetuating factor in psychogenic sexual dysfunction. The cycle is self-reinforcing and can transform an isolated incident into a chronic disorder. The principle behind sensate focus therapy is specifically to break this cycle [2] |
| **Low self-esteem and negative body image** | Inability to perform sexually → internalised as personal failing → ↓self-worth → avoidance of intimacy → social withdrawal | Particularly relevant for men where masculinity is culturally tied to sexual performance, and for post-menopausal women with body image changes |
| **Avoidance of intimacy** | Repeated negative sexual experiences → conditioned avoidance of all physical and emotional intimacy → progressive distancing from partner | This avoidance can generalise beyond the bedroom — couples may avoid all physical affection (hugging, kissing, hand-holding) out of fear it will "lead somewhere" |

#### 1.2 Relational Complications

| Complication | Mechanism / Why It Occurs |
|---|---|
| **Relationship deterioration and breakdown** | Sexual dysfunction → frustration, resentment, communication breakdown between partners → relationship conflict → separation/divorce. The partner may feel rejected, unattractive, or blamed. The patient may withdraw or become defensive. Without intervention, the relationship suffers progressive damage |
| **Infidelity** | An unsatisfied partner may seek sexual fulfilment outside the relationship. Alternatively, the patient themselves may seek new partners to "prove" they can still function (as psychogenic dysfunction may be situational — works with a new partner but not the established one) |
| **Non-consummation of marriage** | Severe vaginismus or ED can result in complete inability to consummate a marriage — this has significant cultural, religious, and legal implications, particularly in Hong Kong where traditional Chinese and religious values place importance on consummation. Some couples present after years of unconsummated marriage |
| **Infertility** | Directly consequent when ED or vaginismus prevents penile-vaginal intercourse; premature ejaculation with ejaculation before penetration; anejaculation or retrograde ejaculation (e.g., post-prostatectomy) [2]. This adds an additional layer of distress, especially in cultures with strong expectations around procreation |

#### 1.3 Complications of Untreated Organic Sexual Dysfunction

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Missed diagnosis of serious underlying disease** | ED is a sentinel marker of cardiovascular disease — penile arteries (1–2mm) are smaller than coronary arteries (3–4mm), so endothelial dysfunction manifests 3–5 years earlier in the penis. A man who does not present with ED (due to embarrassment) misses the opportunity for early CVD intervention. Similarly, sexual dysfunction may be the presenting feature of undiagnosed DM, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinaemia, or depression |
| **Progression of underlying disease** | If the organic cause (DM, CVD, hypogonadism) is not identified and treated, it progresses — DM vasculopathy worsens, CVD risk escalates, and the sexual dysfunction becomes more refractory to treatment |
| **Medication non-compliance** | Patients who develop sexual dysfunction from medications (SSRIs, antihypertensives, antipsychotics) may stop their medication without telling their doctor, leading to relapse of the primary condition (depression relapse, hypertensive crisis, psychotic relapse) [2] |

<Callout title="The Dangerous Silence Around SSRI-Induced Sexual Dysfunction" type="error">
Patients frequently do not volunteer sexual side effects of medications — they simply stop the drug. Studies show that up to 30–40% of patients on SSRIs discontinue treatment primarily due to sexual side effects, but only a fraction discuss this with their prescriber. This leads to depression relapse, which is far more dangerous than the sexual dysfunction itself. **Always proactively ask about sexual side effects when prescribing SSRIs, antipsychotics, or antihypertensives** [2].

#### 1.4 Complications of Treatment of Sexual Dysfunctions

| Treatment | Complication | Mechanism / Why It Occurs |
|---|---|---|
| **PDE5 inhibitors** | Priapism (rare but serious — sustained erection > 4 hours) | Excessive cGMP-mediated smooth muscle relaxation → sustained venous occlusion → ischaemia of corporeal tissue. **Medical emergency** — requires aspiration of blood from corpora cavernosa ± injection of sympathomimetic (phenylephrine). If untreated: ischaemic necrosis → permanent ED |
| **PDE5 inhibitors** | Cardiovascular events | In patients with significant CVD: vasodilation → ↓preload → hypotension. **Fatal with concurrent nitrates**. Also: rarely — NAION (non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy) → sudden visual loss in one eye |
| **Intracavernosal injection** (alprostadil) | Priapism (more common than with PDE5i — up to 5%), penile fibrosis/scarring with repeated injections, pain at injection site, haematoma | Direct pharmacological vasodilation bypasses physiological control → if dose too high or patient hypersensitive, erection does not resolve spontaneously. Repeated needle trauma → fibrosis of corpora cavernosa → worsening ED over time |
| **Penile prosthesis** | Infection (2–3%), mechanical failure, erosion through skin/urethra, partner dissatisfaction, irreversibility | Implant acts as foreign body → biofilm formation → infection. Inflatable devices have hydraulic components that can malfunction. Implantation destroys natural erectile tissue — there is no going back |
| **Testosterone replacement** | Polycythaemia (↑Hct → ↑viscosity → ↑thrombotic risk), prostate stimulation (PSA monitoring required), sleep apnoea worsening, mood changes, acne, gynaecomastia (paradoxically — via aromatisation to oestrogen), liver toxicity (oral formulations) | Testosterone ↑erythropoiesis (stimulates EPO and acts directly on bone marrow). In the prostate: testosterone → DHT (via 5α-reductase) → stimulates prostate growth → concern for prostate cancer acceleration (though testosterone does not cause cancer, it may fuel existing subclinical cancer) |
| **Hormonal therapy** (menopausal HRT) | VTE, stroke, breast cancer (with prolonged combined oestrogen-progesterone use), gallbladder disease | Oestrogen → ↑hepatic production of clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) → hypercoagulable state → VTE/PE/stroke. Prolonged oestrogen exposure → breast epithelial proliferation → ↑breast cancer risk |

### 2. Complications of Paraphilias

#### 2.1 Complications to the Individual

| Complication | Mechanism / Detail |
|---|---|
| **Legal consequences** | Many paraphilias involve non-consenting victims → criminal offences. In Hong Kong: exhibitionism (indecent exposure — Crimes Ordinance), voyeurism (loitering/peeping), frotteurism (indecent assault), paedophilia (various child protection ordinances, statutory rape). Conviction → imprisonment, sex offender registry, lifelong criminal record |
| **Comorbid psychiatric illness** | Paraphilias are associated with ↑rates of depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and other paraphilias (comorbidity between different paraphilias is common — an individual with one paraphilia is likely to have others) [2] |
| **Social ostracism and occupational loss** | Discovery or conviction → loss of employment, social relationships, family. The stigma is profound and permanent |
| **Physical injury** (sexual masochism) | Autoerotic asphyxiation (self-strangulation during masturbation to enhance orgasm through hypoxia-induced euphoria) → accidental death. Estimated 250–1000 deaths/year in the US alone. Other self-injurious masochistic practices → tissue damage, infection |
| **Substance use as self-medication** | Distress from paraphilic urges or guilt after acting on them → alcohol/drug use to cope → substance use disorder → further disinhibition → ↑paraphilic acting-out (vicious cycle) |

#### 2.2 Complications to Victims

| Complication | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Psychological trauma to victims** | Victims of exhibitionism, voyeurism, frotteurism, and especially sexual sadism and paedophilia may develop PTSD, depression, anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunction themselves, and difficulties with trust and intimacy. Childhood sexual abuse (paedophilia) has devastating long-term consequences: ↑risk of depression, PTSD, BPD, substance use, sexual dysfunction, and suicidality in adulthood |
| **Physical harm to victims** | Sexual sadism → physical injury, mutilation, death. Paedophilia → physical injury to children. Frotteurism → can escalate to more contact offences |

#### 2.3 Complications of Treatment of Paraphilias

| Treatment | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Anti-androgens** (cyproterone acetate) | Hepatotoxicity (including fatal hepatic failure), depression, fatigue, gynaecomastia, ↓bone mineral density, weight gain, VTE, loss of fertility | Cyproterone is a potent progestogen with anti-androgen and glucocorticoid activity. Hepatotoxicity is idiosyncratic but dose-related — **LFT monitoring is mandatory**. ↓Testosterone → ↓bone formation (testosterone normally stimulates osteoblasts) → osteoporosis with chronic use |
| **GnRH agonists** (leuprolide, triptorelin) | Hot flushes, ↓bone mineral density (castrate testosterone levels → osteoporosis), depression, cardiovascular risk (metabolic syndrome, ↑LDL), loss of fertility, initial testosterone flare (paradoxical ↑testosterone for 1–2 weeks before suppression — may transiently ↑sexual urges) | GnRH agonist → initial stimulation of pituitary → ↑LH/FSH → ↑testosterone ("flare") → then continuous stimulation → receptor downregulation → ↓LH/FSH → ↓testosterone to castrate levels. The flare is dangerous — may need anti-androgen cover during the first 2 weeks |
| **SSRIs** | Sexual dysfunction (paradoxically — treating one sexual problem may create another), nausea, weight gain, emotional blunting, serotonin syndrome (if combined with MAOIs) | The same serotonergic mechanism that reduces paraphilic drive also reduces normal sexual function. Emotional blunting may reduce empathy development, which is counterproductive for rehabilitation |

<Callout title="GnRH Agonist Testosterone Flare — A Dangerous Paradox" type="error">
When a GnRH agonist is first started, it **initially stimulates** the pituitary (because it is an agonist) → surge of LH/FSH → transient increase in testosterone ("flare") for 1–2 weeks before receptor downregulation causes suppression. During this flare, a sex offender's urges may paradoxically increase. **Anti-androgen cover (e.g., cyproterone)** for the first 2–4 weeks is essential to prevent this. In prostate cancer treatment, this same flare can cause tumour flare symptoms.

### 3. Complications of Gender Dysphoria

#### 3.1 Complications of the Condition Itself

| Complication | Mechanism / Detail |
|---|---|
| ***Comorbid Axis I disorders, especially mood and anxiety disorders*** | Gender dysphoria is associated with ***significantly increased comorbid psychiatric illness*** [2]. This is likely multifactorial: minority stress (discrimination, stigma, family rejection, violence), body dysphoria (distress from physical characteristics incongruent with identity), social isolation, and possibly shared neurobiological vulnerability. Depression and anxiety rates are 2–3x higher than the general population |
| **Suicidality and self-harm** | Transgender individuals have among the highest rates of suicidal ideation and attempts of any population group. Studies show 40–45% lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts in transgender adults. Risk factors: family rejection, bullying/violence, lack of access to gender-affirming care, comorbid mental illness |
| **Substance use disorders** | As self-medication for dysphoria, distress, and social difficulties. Alcohol and cannabis are most common; stimulant and opioid use also elevated |
| **Social and occupational dysfunction** | Discrimination in employment, housing, healthcare; family estrangement; social isolation; bullying (especially in children/adolescents); difficulty maintaining relationships. In Hong Kong, legal protections for transgender individuals remain limited |
| **Self-administered hormones / unsafe procedures** | When access to legitimate medical care is limited (long wait times, cost, fear of gatekeeping), some individuals obtain hormones through unregulated channels (internet pharmacies, black market) or resort to dangerous self-procedures (e.g., silicone injections for breast augmentation). Risks: incorrect dosing, contaminated products, injection-site infections, silicone embolism |

#### 3.2 Complications of Treatment of Gender Dysphoria

##### 3.2.1 Complications of Hormonal Therapy

| Hormone Therapy | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Oestrogen** (MtF) | Venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE) — most serious acute risk | Oestrogen ↑hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors (especially factors II, VII, IX, X) and ↓antithrombin III → hypercoagulable state. Risk is dose-dependent and higher with oral vs transdermal route (first-pass hepatic effect). Smoking synergistically ↑risk |
| **Oestrogen** (MtF) | Cardiovascular events (stroke, MI) | Same hypercoagulable mechanism + potential effects on lipid profile (↑triglycerides, ↑HDL but also ↑clotting). Risk elevated especially in those > 40, smokers, and those with pre-existing CVD risk factors |
| **Oestrogen** (MtF) | Hyperprolactinaemia / prolactinoma | Oestrogen directly stimulates lactotroph proliferation in the anterior pituitary → ↑prolactin secretion → may cause or unmask prolactinoma. Requires monitoring of prolactin levels |
| **Oestrogen** (MtF) | Hepatotoxicity | First-pass hepatic metabolism of oral oestrogen → hepatocellular stress. Transdermal route safer for liver |
| **Oestrogen** (MtF) | Breast cancer (long-term risk) | Prolonged oestrogen exposure → epithelial proliferation in breast tissue → ↑risk over decades. MtF individuals should undergo breast cancer screening |
| **Cyproterone acetate** (MtF anti-androgen) | Hepatotoxicity, meningioma, depression | Cyproterone is hepatotoxic (idiosyncratic and dose-related — monitor LFT). Recent evidence shows ↑risk of meningioma with prolonged use (dose-cumulative). Depression: ↓testosterone contributes to low mood |
| **Testosterone** (FtM) | Polycythaemia | Testosterone ↑erythropoietin secretion from kidneys + direct stimulation of erythroid progenitors in bone marrow → ↑RBC mass → ↑haematocrit. If Hct > 54%: ↑blood viscosity → ↑risk of stroke, DVT, PE, MI. **Monitor FBC regularly — dose reduce or phlebotomise if Hct rises** |
| **Testosterone** (FtM) | Dyslipidaemia | Testosterone → ↑LDL, ↓HDL → ↑atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk over time |
| **Testosterone** (FtM) | Hepatotoxicity | Particularly with oral formulations (rare with injectable/transdermal) |
| **Testosterone** (FtM) | Acne and androgenic alopecia | Testosterone → DHT → stimulates sebaceous glands (acne) and activates hair follicle miniaturisation in genetically susceptible individuals (male-pattern baldness) |
| **Testosterone** (FtM) | Vaginal atrophy | Testosterone ↓local oestrogen effect on vaginal epithelium → thinning, dryness → dyspareunia if vaginal intercourse occurs. Topical oestrogen may be needed |
| **GnRH agonists** (puberty blockers in adolescents) | ↓Bone mineral density, potential impact on height, uncertain effects on neurocognitive development | GnRH suppression → ↓sex steroids → ↓bone mineralisation during a critical window of skeletal development. Puberty is normally the period of peak bone accrual. Long-term BMD consequences are being studied. Reversible on cessation — puberty resumes and bone accrual catches up (though the extent of catch-up is debated) |

##### 3.2.2 Complications of Gender-Confirming Surgery

| Surgery | Complication | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Vaginoplasty** (MtF) | Neovaginal stenosis, fistula (rectovaginal or vesicovaginal), wound dehiscence, hair growth inside neovagina, loss of sensation, urinary complications (urethral stricture, spraying), need for lifelong dilation | The neovagina is created from penile skin (penile inversion technique) or bowel segment. It lacks natural self-maintenance — without regular dilation, the body treats it as a wound and it contracts/closes (wound contraction by myofibroblasts). **Lifelong dilation is mandatory** |
| **Phalloplasty** (FtM) | Highest complication rate of all gender-confirming surgeries (up to 40–60% require revision). Urethral fistula, urethral stricture, flap loss/necrosis, infection, loss of sensation, inability to achieve erection without prosthesis | Phalloplasty typically uses a radial forearm free flap or anterolateral thigh flap — a major microsurgical procedure. Urethral lengthening (to allow standing urination) is the most complication-prone component. Erectile function requires a penile prosthesis (inflatable or semi-rigid) — adding another layer of complication risk |
| **Mastectomy** (FtM) | Haematoma, seroma, nipple necrosis, unsatisfactory cosmetic result, persistent breast tissue (cancer screening still needed) | Relatively straightforward compared to other procedures but cosmetic expectations may not be fully met |
| **Orchidectomy** (MtF) | Irreversible loss of fertility, need for lifelong hormone replacement, surgical complications (bleeding, infection) | Removes the primary source of testosterone — patient becomes dependent on exogenous oestrogen for bone and cardiovascular health |

#### 3.3 Regret and De-transition

- Post-surgical regret is **rare** in modern cohorts with proper assessment (~1–2%) but devastating when it occurs
- ***86% FtM and 71% MtF reported improvement in QoL*** [2] — meaning a significant minority (14% FtM, 29% MtF) do not report improvement, though this does not equate to regret
- Risk factors for poorer outcomes: inadequate pre-surgical assessment, unstable comorbid mental illness, poor social support, unrealistic expectations, external coercion
- De-transition (reverting to living as birth-assigned gender) may occur due to: regret, social pressure, inability to cope with discrimination, realisation of non-binary identity rather than binary transgender identity

### 4. Cross-Cutting Complications

| Complication | Applies To | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Impact on fertility** | All categories | Sexual dysfunctions → inability to conceive naturally. Anti-androgens and GnRH agonists (paraphilias and GD) → ↓spermatogenesis/ovulation. Gender-confirming surgery → irreversible loss of reproductive capacity. **Fertility preservation counselling** (sperm banking, oocyte cryopreservation) should be offered before irreversible treatments |
| **Stigma and discrimination** | All categories | Patients with psychosexual disorders face significant stigma — from family, society, employers, and even healthcare professionals. In Hong Kong, traditional values create additional barriers. Stigma → delayed help-seeking → worse outcomes → ↑complications |
| **Impact on children and families** | All categories | Parental sexual dysfunction → relationship breakdown → impact on children's psychological wellbeing. Paraphilias involving children → devastating trauma. Gender dysphoria in a family member → family adjustment challenges, intergenerational conflict (especially relevant in traditional Chinese families) |
| **Healthcare avoidance** | All categories | Shame and stigma → patients avoid seeking medical care → late presentation for both the psychosexual disorder and for unrelated medical conditions (e.g., a transgender man avoiding cervical screening because of gender incongruence during examination) |

### 5. Summary — Complications by Category

| Category | Key Complications of Disease | Key Complications of Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **Sexual Dysfunctions** | Depression/anxiety (bidirectional), performance anxiety vicious cycle, relationship breakdown, infertility, missed diagnosis of CVD/DM, medication non-compliance [2] | PDE5i: priapism, fatal hypotension with nitrates. Injections: priapism, fibrosis. Prosthesis: infection, irreversibility. Testosterone: polycythaemia, prostate concerns |
| **Paraphilias** | Legal consequences (imprisonment), victim trauma (especially children), social ostracism, comorbid psychiatric illness, accidental death (masochism/autoerotic asphyxiation), substance use [2] | Anti-androgens: hepatotoxicity, depression, osteoporosis. GnRH agonists: testosterone flare, osteoporosis, CVD risk. SSRIs: sexual dysfunction |
| **Gender Dysphoria** | Comorbid mood/anxiety disorders, suicidality (40–45% lifetime SA), substance use, social/occupational dysfunction, self-administered hormones, healthcare avoidance [2] | Oestrogen: VTE, CVD, prolactinoma, breast cancer. Testosterone: polycythaemia, dyslipidaemia. Surgery: stenosis, fistula, loss of sensation, revision rates, irreversibility. Puberty blockers: ↓BMD |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of Psychosexual Disorders">

1. **Sexual dysfunction creates a self-perpetuating vicious cycle**: dysfunction → performance anxiety → sympathetic overdrive → more dysfunction → depression → SSRI → worsened dysfunction → SSRI non-compliance → depression relapse [2].

2. **ED is a cardiovascular sentinel** — untreated ED misses a 3–5 year window for CVD prevention.

3. **Medication non-compliance from sexual side effects** is one of the most dangerous and underappreciated complications — always proactively ask about sexual function when prescribing SSRIs, antihypertensives, and antipsychotics [2].

4. **PDE5i + nitrates = catastrophic hypotension** → absolute contraindication.

5. **Priapism** (sustained erection > 4 hours) from PDE5i or intracavernosal injection = urological emergency → aspiration + phenylephrine; delay causes ischaemic necrosis and permanent ED.

6. **Paraphilias**: Legal consequences dominate. Autoerotic asphyxiation in masochism → accidental death. Paedophilia → devastating lifelong trauma to child victims. GnRH agonists have an initial testosterone flare requiring anti-androgen cover.

7. **Gender dysphoria**: Suicidality is the most serious complication (40–45% lifetime suicide attempts). Oestrogen → VTE (most serious acute complication of MtF hormones). Testosterone → polycythaemia (most serious of FtM hormones). Phalloplasty has highest surgical complication rate (40–60%). **86% FtM, 71% MtF report improved QoL post-treatment** [2].

8. **Fertility preservation counselling** must be offered before any irreversible hormonal or surgical treatment.

      question: "Explain the vicious cycle that links sexual dysfunction, performance anxiety, and depression. How does SSRI treatment paradoxically perpetuate this cycle?",
      markscheme: "Cycle: sexual dysfunction episode leads to performance anxiety. Anxiety causes sympathetic overdrive leading to vasoconstriction and impaired arousal, causing further dysfunction. Repeated failure leads to depression. Depression itself causes sexual dysfunction via anhedonia and decreased libido. SSRIs prescribed for depression increase serotonin which inhibits dopaminergic and NO pathways, worsening sexual dysfunction. Patient may stop SSRI due to intolerable sexual side effects without telling doctor, leading to depression relapse. Each component reinforces the others."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is erectile dysfunction considered a sentinel marker for cardiovascular disease? What is the anatomical basis and the clinical implication?",
      markscheme: "Penile arteries are 1-2mm diameter, smaller than coronary arteries which are 3-4mm. Both share the same pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Because smaller arteries are occluded earlier by atherosclerotic plaque, ED manifests 3-5 years before coronary artery disease symptoms. Clinical implication: every man presenting with ED should be screened for cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking), as this represents a window of opportunity for early cardiovascular intervention."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the testosterone flare phenomenon with GnRH agonists, why is it dangerous in the context of paraphilia treatment, and how is it prevented?",
      markscheme: "GnRH agonists initially stimulate pituitary GnRH receptors before causing downregulation. This causes a transient surge in LH and FSH, leading to increased testosterone for 1-2 weeks (the flare) before eventual suppression to castrate levels. In paraphilia treatment, this flare paradoxically increases sexual urges temporarily, creating a window of increased risk of offending. Prevention: concurrent anti-androgen cover with cyproterone acetate for the first 2-4 weeks until testosterone suppression is established."
    },
    {
      question: "Name the three most serious acute complications of hormonal therapy in gender dysphoria, specifying which direction of transition each applies to and the underlying mechanism.",
      markscheme: "(1) VTE/PE in MtF oestrogen therapy: oestrogen increases hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X and decreases antithrombin III, creating a hypercoagulable state. Most serious acute risk of feminising hormones. (2) Polycythaemia in FtM testosterone therapy: testosterone stimulates erythropoietin production and directly stimulates erythroid progenitors, increasing red cell mass. Haematocrit above 54% increases blood viscosity and risk of stroke/DVT/MI. (3) Hepatotoxicity from cyproterone acetate in MtF: idiosyncratic and dose-related hepatocellular injury, can progress to fatal hepatic failure. Requires regular LFT monitoring."
    },
    {
      question: "A transgender woman post-vaginoplasty stops performing vaginal dilation. What complication will occur and why?",
      markscheme: "Neovaginal stenosis will occur. The neovagina is a surgically created cavity, typically from penile skin inversion. The body treats it as a wound and activates wound healing processes including contraction by myofibroblasts. Without regular dilation to maintain patency, progressive fibrosis and contraction will narrow and eventually close the neovaginal canal. This is why lifelong regular dilation is mandatory after vaginoplasty. If stenosis becomes severe, surgical revision may be needed."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the most life-threatening complication of paraphilic disorders overall, and what is the most life-threatening complication specific to sexual masochism?",
      markscheme: "Most life-threatening complication of paraphilic disorders overall: harm to victims, particularly in sexual sadism (physical injury, mutilation, death of victims) and paedophilia (devastating lifelong psychological and physical trauma to children). Most life-threatening complication specific to sexual masochism: autoerotic asphyxiation, which involves self-strangulation during masturbation to enhance orgasm through hypoxia-induced euphoria. This carries risk of accidental death from loss of consciousness before the ligature can be released. Estimated 250-1000 deaths per year in the US."
