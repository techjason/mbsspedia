## Complications of Stress-Related Disorders

Complications of stress-related disorders are best understood not as isolated sequelae, but as **downstream consequences** of the sustained neurobiological, psychological, and social disruption caused by chronic stress and trauma. ***There is a huge amount of suffering associated with these disorders*** [1]. The complications extend far beyond the primary psychiatric symptoms — they encompass psychiatric comorbidity, medical morbidity, functional impairment, and interpersonal devastation.

Think of PTSD as a disorder that "hijacks" the brain's threat system — the amygdala stays on high alert, the hippocampus cannot properly contextualise, the prefrontal cortex cannot regulate. Every complication follows logically from this sustained neurobiological perturbation.

## 1. Psychiatric Comorbidities

***There are significant comorbid psychiatric conditions associated with anxiety disorders*** [1].

***Co-morbidities of PTSD*** [1]:
- ***Depression***
- ***Other anxiety disorders***
- ***Substance use disorders***
- ***Somatization***
- ***Dissociative disorders***

These are not merely "associated conditions." They are mechanistically linked complications that develop as consequences of the chronic pathophysiology of PTSD.

### A. Depression

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prevalence** | Up to 50% of PTSD patients develop comorbid major depressive disorder; this is the single most common comorbidity |
| **Mechanism** | Chronic HPA axis dysregulation + serotonin depletion + learned helplessness (repeated exposure to uncontrollable threat → belief that one cannot influence outcomes) + social withdrawal and anhedonia from Cluster D (negative cognitions/mood) → progressive depressive syndrome. The Cluster D symptoms of PTSD (guilt, shame, diminished interest, emotional numbing, inability to experience positive emotions) are essentially depressive symptoms embedded within the PTSD framework |
| **Why it matters** | Comorbid depression dramatically worsens PTSD prognosis: ↑chronicity, ↑functional impairment, ↑treatment resistance, and critically, ↑suicide risk. The combination is more than additive |
| **Clinical implication** | Always screen PTSD patients with PHQ-9. SSRIs treat both conditions simultaneously, which is why they are first-line pharmacotherapy for PTSD |

### B. Other Anxiety Disorders

| Disorder | How It Develops | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|---|
| **GAD** | The hypervigilance and threat-scanning of PTSD generalises beyond trauma-related cues → free-floating, pervasive worry about multiple life domains | Amygdala sensitisation → lowered threshold for threat detection → chronic "worry mode" that extends beyond the original trauma context |
| **Panic disorder** | Trauma-related autonomic arousal (tachycardia, diaphoresis, chest tightness) becomes misinterpreted as catastrophic → "Am I dying?" → panic attacks | Catastrophic misinterpretation of trauma-induced somatic symptoms; conditioned autonomic responses to internal cues |
| **Agoraphobia / specific phobias** | Avoidance behaviours in PTSD generalise → patient avoids not only trauma-specific cues but increasingly wider situations → functional constriction | Operant conditioning: avoidance is negatively reinforced → avoidance repertoire expands progressively |
| **Social anxiety** | Estrangement, shame, guilt from PTSD Cluster D → social withdrawal → fear of scrutiny and judgement → social avoidance | Trauma-related shame ("I should have done something") → belief that others will judge negatively → avoidance of social situations |

### C. Substance Use Disorders

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prevalence** | 25–50% of PTSD patients develop comorbid substance use disorders; alcohol is the most common, followed by cannabis, opioids, and benzodiazepines |
| **Mechanism — Self-medication hypothesis** | Patients use substances to dampen hyperarousal (alcohol, BDZs), numb emotional pain (opioids), or cope with insomnia (alcohol, cannabis). The short-term relief negatively reinforces substance use → dependence |
| **Neurobiological basis** | Chronic stress → dysregulation of the reward circuitry (ventral tegmental area → nucleus accumbens). The depleted dopaminergic tone in PTSD creates a state of anhedonia that substances temporarily relieve. Additionally, ↑CRF in PTSD drives stress-induced relapse |
| ***Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder*** [5] | ***Symptoms occur while patient on heavy alcohol consumption; symptoms subside gradually on abstinence, but may persist up to 6 months. Must be distinguished from alcohol withdrawal syndrome*** [5]. This creates a diagnostic challenge: is the anxiety from PTSD driving the drinking, or is the alcohol causing the anxiety? |
| ***Alcohol comorbid psychiatric disorders*** [5] | Alcohol can ***temporarily reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia*** but causes ***increased psychotic symptoms and mood swings, disruptive behaviour, suicide, treatment non-compliance, drug abuse, poor clinical outcome*** [5] |
| **Why it matters** | Substance use worsens every aspect of PTSD: ↓treatment engagement, ↓medication adherence, ↑impulsivity and violence, ↑suicide risk, ↑medical morbidity. It also interferes with psychotherapy (impaired memory consolidation prevents trauma processing) |

<Callout title="The Vicious Cycle of PTSD and Substance Use">
PTSD → hyperarousal/nightmares/emotional pain → self-medication with alcohol/substances → temporary relief (negative reinforcement) → tolerance and dependence → withdrawal symptoms mimic/worsen PTSD (tremor, anxiety, insomnia, irritability) → ↑PTSD symptoms → ↑substance use. Breaking this cycle requires treating BOTH conditions simultaneously, not sequentially.
</Callout>

### D. Somatization

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Chronic autonomic hyperarousal manifests as somatic symptoms (palpitations, chest pain, headaches, GI disturbance, musculoskeletal pain). When patients lack the psychological vocabulary to express distress (alexithymia), or when cultural norms discourage emotional expression, distress is channelled into bodily complaints |
| **Clinical presentation** | Chronic pain syndromes (headache, back pain, fibromyalgia), functional GI disorders (IBS), chronic fatigue, medically unexplained dizziness. These patients often present to medical rather than psychiatric services |
| **Hong Kong context** | Somatisation is particularly common in Chinese populations, where mental health stigma may lead to presentation with physical rather than emotional symptoms. Chronic pain and fatigue are common "somatic masks" of underlying PTSD |
| **Complication risk** | Unnecessary invasive investigations and procedures with iatrogenic complications; substance use (narcotic analgesics, benzodiazepines prescribed for somatic complaints) [2] |

### E. Dissociative Disorders

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Dissociation begins as a peri-traumatic protective mechanism (the brain "disconnects" from overwhelming reality via endogenous opioid release and prefrontal-limbic disconnection). In some patients, this becomes a habitual, maladaptive coping strategy that persists long after the trauma |
| **Presentations** | Depersonalisation (feeling detached from own body), derealisation (feeling the world is unreal), dissociative amnesia (gaps in memory), dissociative identity disorder (in severe chronic childhood trauma) |
| **DSM-5 recognition** | The ***dissociative subtype of PTSD*** (***with dissociative symptoms — derealisation or depersonalisation***) [1] acknowledges that dissociation is a core complication in a substantial subset of PTSD patients |
| **Clinical significance** | Dissociative patients may appear "calm" or "emotionally flat" during assessment, masking severe underlying distress. They may respond differently to treatment — some evidence suggests the dissociative subtype may respond better to psychotherapy that addresses dissociation specifically before trauma processing |

---

## 2. Suicide and Self-Harm

This is the most feared and most important complication.

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Risk magnitude** | PTSD is associated with a 2–3-fold increase in suicide risk compared to the general population. When comorbid with depression and substance use, risk escalates dramatically |
| **Mechanism** | Multiple converging pathways: (a) ***Reckless or self-destructive behaviour*** [1] is a DSM-5 criterion — the disorder itself drives risk-taking; (b) Comorbid depression → hopelessness, suicidal ideation; (c) Substance intoxication → disinhibition; (d) Trauma-related guilt and shame → "I deserve to die"; (e) Chronic hyperarousal → emotional exhaustion → desire for escape; (f) Impaired impulse control from prefrontal hypofunction |
| **Self-harm patterns** | Non-suicidal self-injury (cutting, burning) may serve as an attempt to "feel something" in the context of emotional numbing (Cluster D) or to provide a sense of control over pain. Deliberate self-harm is also a feature of ***adjustment disorder*** — ***behavioural changes include deliberate self-harm, suicidal behaviour*** [2] |
| **Clinical implication** | Risk assessment is mandatory at every clinical encounter with stress-related disorder patients. Use structured tools (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale). Assess for access to lethal means |

<Callout title="Suicide Risk in PTSD" type="error">
Never underestimate suicide risk in PTSD. The combination of PTSD + depression + substance use + access to firearms (particularly in veterans) represents one of the highest-risk profiles in all of psychiatry. Always ask directly about suicidal ideation, intent, plan, and access to means.
</Callout>

## 3. Functional Impairment

***PTSD causes significant impairment in function*** [1]. The disability burden is enormous and affects every domain of life.

| Domain | How PTSD Impairs Function | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Occupational** | Poor concentration → ↓work performance; hypervigilance → inability to focus; avoidance → missing work; irritability → interpersonal conflict with colleagues; substance use → unreliability | Attentional resources hijacked by threat-monitoring (Cluster E); avoidance of work environments if associated with trauma cues (Cluster C) |
| **Social / Interpersonal** | Emotional numbing → inability to connect; estrangement → social isolation; irritability/anger → relationship conflict and breakdown; trust impairment → difficulty forming new relationships | Cluster D (detachment, estrangement, inability to experience positive emotions) + Cluster E (irritability, angry outbursts). In interpersonal trauma, the fundamental sense of trust in other humans is shattered |
| **Self-care** | Neglect of hygiene, nutrition, medical appointments; reckless behaviour (driving, unsafe sex) | Depressive symptoms, anhedonia, self-destructive behaviour (Cluster E); dissociative episodes impairing awareness |
| **Academic** | In younger patients: ↓concentration, avoidance of school, behavioural disturbances | Cognitive resources consumed by intrusive memories and hypervigilance |

---

## 4. Physical Health Complications

Chronic PTSD is associated with significant medical morbidity. This is NOT coincidental — the sustained neurobiological perturbation has direct physiological consequences.

| System | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Cardiovascular** | ↑risk of hypertension, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke; ***↑CVS mortality*** [2] | Chronic sympathetic activation (↑noradrenaline) → sustained ↑HR, ↑BP, ↑vascular tone → accelerated atherosclerosis. Chronic inflammation (↑IL-6, CRP, TNF-α) → endothelial dysfunction |
| **Metabolic** | Obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes | Dysregulated HPA axis → altered cortisol pulsatility → visceral fat deposition; emotional eating as coping; reduced physical activity; medication-related weight gain (SGAs) |
| **Immune** | Chronic low-grade inflammation; impaired wound healing; ↑susceptibility to infections | Chronic stress → shift from Th1 to Th2 immune response (immunosuppression); ↑pro-inflammatory cytokines paradoxically coexist with impaired cellular immunity |
| **Neurological** | Cognitive decline, ↑risk of dementia in later life; chronic pain syndromes | Neurotoxic effects of sustained cortisol/NA on hippocampus → ↓hippocampal volume → memory impairment. Central sensitisation → chronic pain |
| **Gastrointestinal** | IBS, functional dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease | Autonomic dysregulation of gut motility (brain-gut axis); stress-induced ↑gastric acid secretion; altered gut microbiome |
| **Sleep** | Chronic insomnia, nightmares, obstructive sleep apnoea (in obese patients) | Locus coeruleus hyperactivation → disrupted sleep architecture; ↑REM density; cortical hyperarousal preventing deep sleep. Insomnia follows the **Spielman 3P model**: predisposing vulnerability + precipitating trauma + perpetuating factors (maladaptive sleep habits, conditioned arousal in bed) [2] |

<Callout title="PTSD Is Not Just a 'Mental' Illness" type="idea">
The cardiovascular mortality data should shift your thinking: PTSD kills people through heart disease, not just suicide. Chronic sympathetic overdrive and inflammation are as real and as damaging as the psychological symptoms. This is why comprehensive PTSD management must include cardiovascular risk factor screening and management.

## 5. Interpersonal and Family Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Relationship breakdown / divorce** | Emotional numbing → partner feels rejected; irritability/anger → domestic conflict; avoidance → inability to engage in family life; sexual dysfunction (↓libido from depression/SSRIs, or avoidance of intimacy if trauma was sexual) |
| **Domestic violence** | ***Irritable behaviour and angry outbursts*** [1] with little or no provocation → verbal or physical aggression towards family members. Impaired impulse control from prefrontal hypofunction |
| **Intergenerational transmission** | Children of PTSD parents are at increased risk of developing anxiety, behavioural problems, and PTSD themselves. Mechanisms: (a) disrupted attachment (emotionally unavailable parent); (b) modelling of avoidant/hypervigilant behaviour; (c) genetic vulnerability; (d) exposure to parental substance use and domestic violence |
| **Social isolation** | Progressive avoidance → shrinking social world → loneliness → worsened depression → further withdrawal. The social isolation itself becomes a perpetuating factor that maintains the disorder |

---

## 6. Complications of Adjustment Disorder

Adjustment disorder is generally milder but carries its own complications [2]:

| Complication | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Progression to MDD or GAD** | ***Prognosis is usually good, but may herald future development of anxiety/depression*** [2]. Adjustment disorder may be a prodrome or early manifestation of a more serious psychiatric condition |
| **Deliberate self-harm and suicidal behaviour** | Behavioural changes in adjustment disorder include ***deliberate self-harm, suicidal behaviour*** [2]. This is frequently underestimated — adjustment disorder is the most common diagnosis in suicide attempters presenting to emergency departments |
| **Substance misuse** | ***Misuse of alcohol or drugs*** [2] as a maladaptive coping strategy |
| **Occupational and academic impairment** | Inability to cope with the precipitating stressor (e.g., job change, relationship breakdown) → cascading dysfunction |

<Callout title="Don't Dismiss Adjustment Disorder" type="error">
Despite being considered a "milder" condition, adjustment disorder accounts for a disproportionate number of suicide attempts. In some studies, it is the most common psychiatric diagnosis associated with deliberate self-harm. Always assess suicide risk even in adjustment disorder.
</Callout>

---

## 7. Iatrogenic Complications

| Complication | Source | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Medication side effects** | SSRIs: sexual dysfunction, GI symptoms, initial anxiety worsening, serotonin syndrome if combined with MAOIs. SGAs: metabolic syndrome (weight gain, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia). TCAs: anticholinergic effects, cardiac toxicity in overdose. Prazosin: orthostatic hypotension | Direct pharmacological effects of medications used to treat PTSD |
| **Benzodiazepine dependence** | BDZs prescribed for PTSD anxiety/insomnia → tolerance → dose escalation → dependence → withdrawal symptoms mimic PTSD (anxiety, tremor, insomnia) | GABA-A receptor downregulation with chronic use; negative reinforcement maintains use |
| **Unnecessary investigations** | Somatisation leads to repeated medical consultations → over-investigation → false positives → invasive procedures → iatrogenic harm | Patients present with somatic symptoms; clinicians pursue organic workup repeatedly without recognising the underlying stress-related disorder |
| **Retraumatisation in therapy** | Poorly conducted exposure therapy or premature trauma processing → worsening of symptoms, dropout | If exposure is too intense, too fast, or without adequate preparation and safety, it can overwhelm rather than help. This is why trauma-focused CBT requires trained therapists |

---

## 8. Course and Prognosis

| Disorder | Natural History | Key Prognostic Factors |
|---|---|---|
| **Acute Stress Reaction** | Self-limiting within hours to days | Universal recovery expected |
| **Acute Stress Disorder** | ***~40–80% develop subsequent PTSD*** [2] | Severity of acute symptoms, dissociation, peritraumatic arousal |
| **PTSD** | ***~50% remit within 3 months; ~40% run a chronic course*** [2] | Good prognosis: early treatment, strong social support, single discrete trauma, no comorbidities. Poor prognosis: chronic/repeated trauma, comorbid depression/substance use, personality disorder, avoidant coping, ongoing stressors |
| **Adjustment Disorder** | ***Most will last for a few months after stressor is removed; prognosis is usually good*** [2] | ***May herald future development of anxiety/depression*** [2]. Worse if personality vulnerability, ongoing stressor, comorbid substance use |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. ***PTSD comorbidities***: ***Depression, other anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, somatization, dissociative disorders*** [1]
2. ***There are significant comorbid psychiatric conditions associated with anxiety disorders*** [1] — comorbidity is the rule, not the exception
3. PTSD is associated with **2–3× increased suicide risk**; always assess suicidality; ***reckless or self-destructive behaviour*** is a DSM-5 criterion [1]
4. **Self-medication hypothesis**: patients use alcohol/substances to dampen hyperarousal → dependence → worsened PTSD (vicious cycle)
5. ***Alcohol temporarily reduces symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia but causes increased psychotic symptoms, mood swings, disruptive behaviour, suicide, treatment non-compliance, poor clinical outcome*** [5]
6. **Physical health**: chronic sympathetic activation → ↑cardiovascular mortality, metabolic syndrome, chronic pain, immune dysregulation, cognitive decline
7. **Interpersonal**: emotional numbing + irritability → relationship breakdown, domestic violence, intergenerational transmission to children
8. **Adjustment disorder complications**: often underestimated; ***may herald future development of anxiety/depression*** [2]; significant association with deliberate self-harm and suicide attempts
9. **Iatrogenic risks**: BDZ dependence, medication side effects, unnecessary investigations from somatisation, retraumatisation from poorly conducted therapy
10. ***ASD: 40–80% develop subsequent PTSD; PTSD: ~50% remit within 3 months but ~40% chronic course*** [2]
