## Complications of Substance Misuse

Complications of substance misuse are vast, touching virtually every organ system, every psychiatric diagnosis, and every domain of social functioning. The key organising principle is that complications arise from three distinct mechanisms:

1. **Direct pharmacological effects** of the substance (acute and chronic toxicity)
2. **Route of administration** (what you put the drug through — IV, smoking, snorting)
3. **Behavioural consequences** of intoxication, dependence, and the addictive lifestyle

***The impact of addiction spans*** [1]:
- ***Route*** — ***ingestion, inhalation/smoking, injection (subcutaneous, muscle, intravenous)***
- ***Form/substances (state of intoxication/withdrawal)***
- ***Chronic use***
- ***Self-care***

Let's work through this systematically.

### A. Medical Complications

#### A.1 Route-Related Complications

The route of administration determines which organ systems are damaged mechanically and which infectious risks the patient faces.

| Route | Complications | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Intravenous injection** | Injection site: cellulitis, subcutaneous/deep abscesses, thrombophlebitis, thrombosed veins, needle tracks, scarring | Direct tissue damage + introduction of bacteria (non-sterile technique, skin flora introduced into subcutaneous tissue/veins) |
| | **Blood-borne infections**: Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV | Needle sharing → direct blood-to-blood transmission. HCV is the most efficiently transmitted (even with tiny blood residue) |
| | **Infective endocarditis** (typically right-sided — tricuspid valve) | Bacteria from non-sterile injection enter venous circulation → seed on valve leaflets. Right-sided because venous blood passes through right heart first. Staph. aureus is the most common organism |
| | **Septic emboli** → pulmonary abscesses, septic pulmonary emboli | From right-sided vegetations → lungs |
| | **DVT, PE** | Venous damage + immobility during intoxication + repeated venous puncture → Virchow's triad |
| | **Tetanus, botulism** | Especially with skin-popping (subcutaneous injection) and injection into muscle; anaerobic organisms from contaminated drug preparations |
| **Smoking/Inhalation** | COPD, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, lung cancer | Combustion products → chronic airway inflammation, mucociliary damage, carcinogen exposure |
| | Crack lung (cocaine) — diffuse alveolar damage, haemoptysis | Inhaled cocaine causes direct thermal/chemical injury to alveolar epithelium + vasoconstriction → ischaemia |
| | Aspiration pneumonia | Depressed consciousness during intoxication → loss of protective airway reflexes → aspiration of gastric contents |
| **Intranasal (snorting)** | Nasal septal perforation, chronic rhinitis, sinusitis | Cocaine/methamphetamine cause intense local vasoconstriction → mucosal ischaemia → tissue necrosis → perforation |
| **Oral** | GI complications (hepatotoxicity, GI bleeding — esp with alcohol) | Fewer route-specific complications; most harm is from the pharmacological effects of the substance itself |

<Callout title="Physical Signs That Should Alert You to IV Drug Use" type="idea">
***Physical signs: needle tracks, thrombosed veins, wearing of long-sleeved shirts in hot weather, scars, subcutaneous/deep abscesses, hepatitis B/C*** [2]. On examination, check the antecubital fossae, dorsal hands, feet, and neck veins. Long-term IVDU may resort to femoral vein injection ("groin injecting") which carries the highest risk of DVT, femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, and necrotising fasciitis.
</Callout>

#### A.2 Substance-Specific Medical Complications

##### A.2.1 Alcohol — Chronic Medical Complications

Alcohol is arguably the substance with the broadest spectrum of medical complications because of its direct toxicity to multiple organ systems, combined with secondary nutritional deficiency.

| System | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Liver** | Fatty liver → alcoholic hepatitis → cirrhosis → hepatocellular carcinoma | Ethanol metabolism generates acetaldehyde (toxic) + NADH excess → fatty acid synthesis, oxidative stress, stellate cell activation → fibrosis → cirrhosis. The progression is: steatosis (reversible) → steatohepatitis → fibrosis → cirrhosis (irreversible) |
| **GI** | Oesophageal varices, GI bleeding, pancreatitis (acute and chronic), Mallory-Weiss tears, oesophageal cancer | Cirrhosis → portal hypertension → varices; direct mucosal irritation → Mallory-Weiss; acetaldehyde is a direct carcinogen; alcohol is the most common cause of chronic pancreatitis |
| **CVS** | Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (dilated), atrial fibrillation ("holiday heart"), hypertension | Direct myocardial toxicity → myocyte death → fibrosis → dilated CMP; acute binge drinking → adrenergic surge → AF. Chronic hypertension mechanism is multifactorial (↑SNS, ↑cortisol, ↑RAAS) |
| **Haem** | Macrocytic anaemia (↑MCV), pancytopenia, folate deficiency, iron deficiency (GI blood loss) | Direct marrow toxicity + folate deficiency (poor diet + ↓absorption) → megaloblastic anaemia; hypersplenism from cirrhosis → pancytopenia |
| **Metabolic** | Hypoglycaemia, alcoholic ketoacidosis, hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia | Ethanol inhibits gluconeogenesis → hypoglycaemia; accumulation of NADH shifts metabolism towards ketogenesis; Mg wasting (↑renal excretion + poor dietary intake) → secondary hypoK (Mg required for K reabsorption) |
| **Endocrine** | Hypogonadism, gynaecomastia, testicular atrophy, reduced fertility | Direct gonadotoxicity; liver impairment → ↓ oestrogen clearance → gynaecomastia; ↓testosterone production |
| **Immune** | Immunosuppression → ↑risk of TB, pneumonia, other infections | Alcohol suppresses innate and adaptive immunity; malnutrition compounds this |
| **Musculoskeletal** | Myopathy (acute and chronic), osteoporosis, avascular necrosis | Direct myotoxicity; ↓osteoblast activity + ↑osteoclast activity; impaired calcium/vitamin D metabolism |

##### A.2.2 Alcohol — Neurological Complications

This is extremely high-yield for exams, especially the Wernicke-Korsakoff spectrum.

**a. Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS)** [2]

This is really one disease spectrum caused by **thiamine (vitamin B₁) deficiency**:

***Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE): acute, potentially reversible*** [2]

The classic triad:
1. ***Encephalopathy***: ***delirium with profound disorientation, apathy, inattention, amnesia*** [2]
2. ***Oculomotor dysfunction*** [2]:
   - ***Ophthalmoplegia***: typically a ***combination of palsies bilaterally*** (lateral rectus palsy → CN VI most commonly affected)
   - ***Nystagmus***: most commonly ***horizontal*** but can be ***vertical*** [2]
   - ***Pupillary abnormalities***: usually ***sluggish or unequal pupils*** [2]
3. ***Truncal ataxia*** (vermis type): ***ataxic, wide-based gait with short steps*** [2]
4. ***Others: polyneuropathy (50%), hypothermia (1-4%), vestibular dysfunction, coma (rare)*** [2]

***Why thiamine deficiency?*** Alcohol inhibits the ***active process for thiamine absorption in the GI tract*** [2]. Thiamine is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase — enzymes critical for aerobic metabolism. Without thiamine, neurons (which are entirely dependent on aerobic glucose metabolism) undergo energy failure and death, particularly in the mammillary bodies, medial thalamus, periaqueductal grey, and cerebellar vermis.

***Diagnosis: Caine criteria (≥ 2 out of 4)*** [2]:
1. ***Dietary deficiency***
2. ***Oculomotor abnormalities***
3. ***Cerebellar dysfunction***
4. ***Altered mental state or amnesia***

***Management: parenteral thiamine immediately upon suspicion*** [2]. ***Oral thiamine as maintenance*** [2].

***Course: prompt administration of thiamine leads to improvement in ocular signs within hours to days, with confusion subsiding in days to weeks*** [2].

***Prognosis: mortality 17% in acute stage; majority have residual deficits (nystagmus, ataxic gait, memory deficits); 84% develop Korsakoff syndrome (irreversible)*** [2].

**Korsakoff syndrome**: The chronic, irreversible sequela of untreated or inadequately treated Wernicke's. Characterised by:
- **Anterograde amnesia** (cannot form new memories) — most prominent
- **Retrograde amnesia** (loss of old memories, temporally graded — recent > remote)
- **Confabulation** (unconscious fabrication of memories to fill gaps — NOT deliberate lying)
- Relatively preserved other cognitive functions and personality

**b. Other Alcohol-Related Neurological Sequelae** [2]

| Complication | Pathogenesis | Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration*** | ***Nutritional deficiency + neurotoxicity → degeneration of Purkinje cells in cerebellar cortex → vermis atrophy*** [2] | ***Subacute/chronic onset of ataxic gait → truncal ataxia*** [2]. Stabilises with abstinence; progresses with continued drinking. ***CT/MRI: cerebellar cortical atrophy, especially affecting anterior vermis*** [2][3] |
| ***Alcohol-related dementia*** | ***Usually multifactorial: head injury, vascular changes, direct alcohol neuronal toxicity*** [2] | ***Cognitive impairment simulating frontal lobe dementia*** [2] (frontal lobes most susceptible). Prevalence: ***~50-70% of alcohol abusers have some degree of cognitive deficits*** [2]. Diagnosed ***8 weeks after abstinence*** [2]. Neuroimaging: ***cerebral cortical atrophy with enlarged lateral ventricles; loss of grey matter; white matter changes with demyelination on DTI*** [2] |
| ***Marchiafava-Bignami disease*** | ***Rare demyelinating disorder of corpus callosum due to hypovitaminosis B (esp B₁)*** [2] | ***Frontal syndrome (frontal dementia, personality changes), seizures, spasticity, rigidity, paralysis, coma, death*** [2]. Neuroimaging: ***hypodense/vacuolation of corpus callosum with white matter lesions*** [2] |
| ***Central pontine myelinolysis*** | ***Rapid correction of hypoNa in acute intoxication → osmotic demyelination of pons*** [2] | ***Spastic paralysis of 4 limbs, personality changes, inappropriate affect, delusions*** [2]. ***Prevention: never correct hypoNa quicker than ~10 mmol/24h*** [2] |
| ***Alcohol-tobacco amblyopia*** | ***Heavy drinking + smoking → thiamine or B₁₂ deficiency → optic atrophy*** [2] | ***↓ visual acuity with central scotoma and loss of colour vision*** [2] |
| **Peripheral neuropathy** | Direct neurotoxicity + thiamine/B₁₂ deficiency → axonal degeneration (length-dependent) | Distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy — "glove and stocking" numbness/pain, ↓ankle reflexes |
| ***B₁₂ deficiency*** | ***Poor nutrition associated with chronic alcoholism*** [2] | ***Subacute combined degeneration of cord, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, optic atrophy, dementia, depression, psychosis, delirium. Classically: loss of ankle jerk (peripheral neuropathy) with ↑knee jerk (corticospinal tract involvement)*** [2] |
| ***B₃ deficiency (pellagra)*** | ***Poor nutrition*** [2] | ***3Ds: dementia, dermatitis, diarrhoea; + peripheral neuropathy, psychiatric changes*** [2] |
| **Risk of stroke** | ***Light/moderate drinking → ↓ risk of ischaemic stroke; heavy drinking → ↑ risk of haemorrhagic stroke*** [2] | Moderate alcohol raises HDL (protective); heavy use → hypertension, coagulopathy, AF → haemorrhagic stroke |

<Callout title="Wernicke's — Give Thiamine BEFORE Glucose" type="error">
This is hammered home in every exam. Glucose loading in a thiamine-depleted patient consumes the last remaining thiamine (needed as a cofactor for glucose metabolism), precipitating or worsening Wernicke's encephalopathy. Always give parenteral thiamine first (or simultaneously with glucose), NEVER glucose alone in a suspected alcoholic patient.
</Callout>

##### A.2.3 Opioid-Specific Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Fatal overdose** (respiratory depression) | μ-receptor agonism at brainstem respiratory centre → ↓ respiratory drive → apnoea → death. This is the #1 cause of death in opioid dependence |
| **Constipation** (chronic) | μ-receptors in myenteric plexus → ↓ peristalsis → chronic constipation → bowel obstruction, faecal impaction |
| **Endocrinopathy** | Chronic opioids → hypothalamic-pituitary suppression → ↓ GnRH → ↓ testosterone/oestrogen → hypogonadism, ↓ libido, amenorrhoea, osteoporosis |
| **Immune suppression** | Opioids modulate immune cell function → ↑ susceptibility to infections |
| **Neonatal abstinence syndrome** | Maternal opioid use → transplacental transfer → fetal dependence → neonatal withdrawal after delivery (tremor, irritability, poor feeding, seizures) |

##### A.2.4 Stimulant-Specific Complications [2]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***MI, cardiomyopathy, sudden CVS collapse*** [2] | Massive catecholamine surge → coronary vasospasm (cocaine), direct myocardial toxicity, accelerated atherosclerosis. Cocaine specifically: ↑ platelet aggregation + vasoconstriction + ↑ myocardial O₂ demand |
| ***Stroke*** [2] | Hypertensive crisis → haemorrhagic stroke; cocaine → vasospasm → ischaemic stroke |
| ***Choreiform movement disorder*** [2] | Chronic dopamine excess → dopaminergic sensitisation in basal ganglia → dyskinesias |
| ***Psychosis (persecutory delusions, AH, VH)*** [2] | ↑↑ DA in mesolimbic pathway → positive psychotic symptoms. ***Usually subside ≤ 1 week but may persist > 1 month*** [2] |
| ***Obstetric: miscarriage, premature labour, placental abruption*** [2] | Vasoconstriction of uterine arteries → placental ischaemia → abruption. Sympathomimetic effects → uterine contractions |
| ***Severe depression, suicidal ideation during crash*** [2] | DA store depletion → profound dopaminergic deficit post-binge → anhedonia, psychomotor retardation |

##### A.2.5 Ketamine-Specific Complications [2]

- ***Ketamine-induced ulcerative cystitis/uropathy***: ***haematuria, frequency, urge incontinence, ↓ bladder volume with detrusor overactivity*** [2]. This is characteristic of chronic ketamine users in HK. The mechanism is direct chemical toxicity of ketamine metabolites on the urothelium → chronic inflammation → fibrosis → contracted bladder. Can be **irreversible** in severe cases.
- Biliary dilatation and abnormal LFTs (ketamine is excreted in bile → cholangiopathy)

##### A.2.6 MDMA-Specific Complications [2]

- ***Hyponatraemia*** [2]: SIADH + excessive water intake → dilutional hypoNa → cerebral oedema, seizures
- ***Hyperthermia*** [2]: Vigorous physical activity (dancing) + impaired thermoregulation (5-HT effect) + warm environment → potentially fatal hyperthermia → rhabdomyolysis → AKI
- ***Serotonin syndrome*** [2]: Especially dangerous when combined with SSRIs or MAOIs
- ***Hepatotoxicity*** [2]: Direct hepatotoxic effect of MDMA metabolites
- ***Chronic: degeneration of 5-HT nerve terminals*** → ***long-term psychiatric sequelae (depression, anxiety, depersonalisation, memory impairment)*** [2]

##### A.2.7 Cannabis-Specific Complications

- ***Chronic use → downregulation of GABA receptors → ↓ inhibition on DA release → ↑ risk of schizophrenia*** [2]. This is one of the best-established psychiatric consequences — cannabis is an independent risk factor for psychosis, especially in genetically predisposed individuals, with a dose-response relationship (higher THC content and earlier age of onset = higher risk)
- Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: cyclic vomiting + abdominal pain + compulsive hot bathing in chronic heavy users. Mechanism not fully understood (paradoxical — cannabis is usually anti-emetic)
- Amotivational syndrome: apathy, ↓ goal-directed behaviour, ↓ productivity (controversial — may reflect pre-existing traits)

---

### B. Psychiatric Complications

***Alcohol use can be a cause or effect of other psychiatric disorders*** [2]. This bidirectional relationship applies to all substances.

#### B.1 Substance-Induced Psychiatric Disorders

| Disorder | Substances | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Substance-induced depression** | Alcohol (most common), stimulant withdrawal, cannabis, opioids | Temporal link to substance use; usually resolves with sustained abstinence (weeks-months). Chronic alcohol use is the most common cause |
| **Substance-induced psychosis** | Methamphetamine, cocaine, cannabis, alcohol (withdrawal — DT), ketamine, LSD | Visual hallucinations more common than auditory; resolves with abstinence in most cases; cannabis can trigger persistent psychosis in vulnerable individuals |
| **Substance-induced anxiety** | Stimulant intoxication, alcohol/BDZ/opioid withdrawal, caffeine, cannabis | Withdrawal anxiety from GABAergic substances can be indistinguishable from primary anxiety disorders |
| **Substance-induced delirium** | Alcohol withdrawal (DT), BDZ withdrawal, anticholinergic intoxication | Fluctuating consciousness is the hallmark — this is an acute medical emergency |
| **Substance-induced amnestic syndrome** | Alcohol (Korsakoff syndrome), BDZs (anterograde amnesia) | Korsakoff: irreversible anterograde + retrograde amnesia with confabulation |

#### B.2 ***Alcohol and Comorbid Psychiatric Disorders*** [3]

***Alcohol comorbid psychiatric disorders*** [3]:

- ***Schizophrenia: 30% of patients with schizophrenia have comorbid alcohol problems*** [3]
  - ***Alcohol decreases feelings of isolation***
  - ***Temporarily reduces symptoms of anxiety/depression/insomnia***
  - ***But increases psychotic symptoms and mood swings***
  - ***Leads to disruptive behaviour, suicide, treatment non-compliance, drug abuse, poor clinical outcome***
  - ***Drug accumulation due to hepatic damage*** [3] — liver impairment → ↓ metabolism of antipsychotics → toxicity

- ***20% of drug abusers are alcoholic; alcoholics are 6 times more prone to become drug abusers*** [3] — polysubstance use is the rule, not the exception

#### B.3 ***Alcohol and Suicide*** [3]

This is critically important:

> ***7% of alcohol abusers die of suicide*** [3]
>
> ***Alcoholism is a factor in 30% of all completed suicides*** [3]
>
> ***50% of suicide attempts have consumed alcohol at the time of the attempt*** [3]
>
> ***96% of alcoholics who die by suicide continue alcohol use up to the end of their lives*** [3]

Why is the link so strong? Multiple mechanisms converge:
- Alcohol causes and exacerbates depression (direct neurotoxic effect on serotonergic pathways)
- Alcohol causes disinhibition → lowers the threshold for acting on suicidal thoughts
- Chronic alcoholism leads to social losses (relationships, employment, housing) → hopelessness
- Withdrawal states include severe anxiety and agitation → impulsive self-harm
- Comorbid psychiatric disorders (depression, personality disorders) are both risk factors for alcoholism and suicide

#### B.4 Bipolar Disorder and Substance Misuse [4]

***Medical comorbidity in bipolar disorder*** — risk factors include [4]:
- ***Alcohol and substance use***
- ***Unhealthy diet, physical inactivity***
- ***Social isolation, unemployment***
- ***Side effects of pharmacotherapy (e.g., sodium valproate, atypical antipsychotics)***

These factors collectively explain the ***significantly ↑ mortality and ↓ life expectancy by ~13 years (M) and 9 years (F)*** in bipolar disorder [2], with ***suicide (1/3 of mortality): ~8% (M) and 5% (F) hospitalised patients die by suicide over 40 years*** [2].

---

### C. Social Complications

| Domain | Complications | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Occupational** | Absenteeism (esp Mondays — "St Monday's syndrome"), ↓ productivity, job loss, occupational decline | Intoxication → inability to work; withdrawal → too unwell; cognitive decline → ↓ performance |
| **Financial** | Debt, poverty, bankruptcy | Expenditure on substances; loss of income from unemployment; financial exploitation |
| **Interpersonal** | Marital breakdown, domestic violence, child neglect/abuse, social isolation | Intoxication → disinhibition → aggression; neglect of relationships as substance becomes priority |
| **Legal/Forensic** | ***Minor criminal offences (esp for cash, e.g., theft, prostitution)*** [2]; DUI, drug possession charges | Need to fund habit; disinhibited behaviour while intoxicated; possession of illicit substances |
| **Housing** | Homelessness | Loss of income + interpersonal breakdown → eviction |
| ***Self-care*** | ***↓ Self-care*** [1][2] — poor hygiene, malnutrition, dental decay | Substance use takes priority over basic needs; anorexia (stimulants); malnutrition (alcohol) |
| **Driving** | Road traffic accidents | Impaired coordination, judgment, reaction time |

---

### D. Complications of Treatment

| Treatment | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Methadone maintenance** | QTc prolongation → torsades de pointes; respiratory depression (esp with BDZ co-use); constipation; weight gain | Methadone blocks hERG potassium channels → prolonged repolarisation → arrhythmia risk. Full μ-agonist → respiratory depression dose-dependent |
| **Disulfiram** | Disulfiram-ethanol reaction (flushing, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, hypotension); hepatotoxicity; psychosis (rare) | ALDH inhibition → acetaldehyde accumulation → toxic reaction. Direct hepatotoxicity (monitor LFTs). Inhibits dopamine-β-hydroxylase → ↑ DA → psychosis in vulnerable patients |
| **Naltrexone/Nalmefene** | Hepatotoxicity (high doses); precipitated withdrawal if opioids present; nausea, headache | μ-receptor blockade → abrupt loss of agonist effect if opioids on board; direct hepatotoxicity mechanism unclear |
| **Acamprosate** | GI side effects (diarrhoea); headache | Generally well-tolerated; renally excreted (avoid in renal impairment) |
| **Flumazenil** | Precipitated withdrawal seizures in BDZ-dependent patients | Competitive antagonism at BDZ site → sudden loss of GABA enhancement → excitatory rebound |
| **Naloxone** | Precipitated withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients; re-sedation (short half-life) | Competitive μ-antagonism; heroin/methadone outlast naloxone → re-sedation after naloxone wears off |

---

### E. Prognosis

The prognosis of substance use disorders is variable and depends heavily on the substance, severity, comorbidities, social support, and treatment engagement:

| Factor | Better prognosis | Worse prognosis |
|---|---|---|
| **Substance** | Cannabis, BDZs | Opioids, methamphetamine, alcohol |
| **Severity** | Harmful use / mild SUD | Severe dependence / addiction |
| **Comorbidity** | No psychiatric comorbidity | ***Comorbid substance abuse*** is consistently listed as a poor prognostic factor across all psychiatric disorders — schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression [2][4] |
| **Treatment** | Early engagement, good adherence | Treatment resistance, poor insight |
| **Social** | Stable housing, employment, supportive relationships | Homelessness, social isolation, ongoing exposure to drug-using peers |
| **BDZ dependence** | ***After attaining abstinence, 73% and 59% maintain abstinence at 3 and 10 years respectively*** [2] | Prolonged withdrawal symptoms for months to years |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Route-related complications**: IVDU → cellulitis, abscesses, hepatitis B/C, HIV, right-sided endocarditis, DVT/PE. Smoking → COPD, aspiration pneumonia. Snorting → nasal septal perforation.

**Alcohol neurological complications** (highest yield):
- Wernicke's encephalopathy: triad of encephalopathy + ophthalmoplegia/nystagmus + truncal ataxia. Thiamine deficiency. Caine criteria (≥2/4). Give parenteral thiamine IMMEDIATELY (before glucose!). 84% → irreversible Korsakoff syndrome
- Korsakoff syndrome: anterograde/retrograde amnesia + confabulation. Irreversible.
- Cerebellar degeneration: Purkinje cell loss → vermis atrophy → truncal ataxia
- Alcohol-related dementia: frontal lobe pattern; 50-70% of abusers have some cognitive deficits
- Central pontine myelinolysis: rapid hypoNa correction → pontine demyelination. Prevent: correct Na < 10 mmol/24h

**Alcohol and suicide**: 7% of alcohol abusers die by suicide; alcoholism is a factor in 30% of all completed suicides; 50% of suicide attempters consumed alcohol at the time

**Alcohol comorbid with schizophrenia**: 30% prevalence; temporarily reduces isolation/anxiety but worsens psychosis, mood, compliance, outcomes; drug accumulation from hepatic damage

**Substance-specific**: Ketamine → ulcerative cystitis (HK-relevant, potentially irreversible). MDMA → hyponatraemia + hyperthermia + serotonin syndrome + 5-HT neurotoxicity. Stimulants → MI/stroke/psychosis/obstetric complications. Cannabis → schizophrenia risk (dose-response).

**Comorbid substance abuse is a poor prognostic factor** across schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression.
