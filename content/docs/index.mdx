## Welcome to MBBSPedia

MBBSPedia is my personal MBBS revision workspace.

I am Jason (M28), and this library is actively maintained for day-to-day study use.

<Callout title="Use and Sharing Notice" type="warning">
  This project is for self-use and is not intended for redistribution. It
  contains copyrighted images, and some notes are derived from lecture sites.
  Lectures are intentionally redacted where required. Please do not share this
  beyond intended use to avoid copyright and logistics issues.
</Callout>

I have created this with the intention of understanding the material. Hence these notes are intentionally more comprehensive, detailed and explains every thing to aid in understanding rather than dry memorisation. Materials from lecture slides are italicised.

Every condition is splitted into 5 sections: Etiology, Differential Diagnosis, Diagnosis, Management and Complications. There is automatic AI grading workflow at the end with active recall questions.

## Source Acknowledgment

The primary golden-source notes used in this workflow include:

- Lecture slides and seminar slides
- Felix Lai
- Maxim
- Ryan Ho

## Sourcing Workflow

- RAG indexing is used over Felix Lai, Ryan Ho and Maxim notes, together with lecture slides. An agentic workflow is deployed for fact checking across reuptable medical journals and sources.
- A "friendly" bedside professor teaching tone is deployed to aid in readability over dry textbooks.
- Master generation prompts are used with Claude (Anthropic Opus 4.6).
- Notes are organized by disease and by presenting symptoms.
- Separate notes are maintained for history taking.
- The library is continuously growing and regularly edited.

## Feedback

The project is open source for transparency and ongoing improvement. If you spot errors, please share feedback.
