## Welcome to MBBSPedia

MBBSPedia is a student-built medical knowledge base for MBBS revision.

## What This Site Is For

- Structured revision notes for medical students.
- Fast topic lookup and exam-oriented consolidation.
- Guided links back to citable public references.

## Public Source Policy

All public pages must follow this rule set:

- Allowed sources: public guidelines, public-domain or openly licensed resources, and publisher content that explicitly permits reuse.
- Not allowed on public pages: university lecture slides, Moodle material, private handouts, private senior notes, or any source without clear redistribution rights.
- If a page contains restricted-derived material, it must be rewritten from permitted sources before remaining public.
- AI-generated text is treated as draft text only and must be validated against permitted references.

## Citation and Transparency Policy

- References must remain visible on every page.
- Factual claims should be traceable to explicit references.
- Prefer the newest available guideline versions and include publication year when possible.
- If a source cannot be publicly linked or clearly licensed, it should not be used in public content.

## Content Status Labels

Each page should carry one of these statuses in the frontmatter or editorial metadata:

- `public-source-verified`: sourced from allowed public references.
- `needs-source-review`: citations incomplete or outdated.
- `restricted-derived`: contains non-public source influence and requires rewrite before public publication.

## Corrections and Takedown

If you are a rights holder, teacher, or student and believe content should be corrected or removed:

- Open an issue in the project repository.
- Include the page URL, the disputed section, and your reason.
- The content will be reviewed and removed or revised as needed.

## Editorial Workflow

- Draft from allowed public references first.
- Add inline citations and a visible references section.
- Perform a source-rights check before publishing.
- Re-review pages periodically as guidelines are updated.

## Quick Navigation

- Start with specialty index pages under the docs sidebar.
- Use page-level references to verify key statements quickly.
